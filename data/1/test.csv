DE03BAA4291D,"Everyone knows that a teenagers emotion can change very fast .Some people know that If in a bad mood it can affect how us students do our work. I think its not a terrible idea to have facial recongition to access our emotions.

First, I think using technology to access our emotions is a smart idea. Teachers often pick on the students who dont seem to be paying attention to what he or she is saying but what if that kid that they call on is just having a bad day? well with this technology they can tell if their students are sad or mad or even surprised .

To continue, I also see why people would argue why it is not a good idea. Maybe the technology will glitch and cause error. People also might say that the technology is reading enough of our emotions, and should include more emotions to read. Maybe it doesnt read some important ones like disgust or surprised. I would like to argue that even though it may not be able to read all of our emotions yet that they might be able to come up with ways to read more of our emotions in the future.

Secondly, I think it would be a greater and easier way for teachers and classmates to come in touch with their students and be able to support them when they are in need. I also think if schools began to use them less students would be bullied because knowing everyone else can read the bullies emotions will not help the bully and he will begin to stop and realize what he is doing to himself and his peers. I think using this technology will help with bettering our world.

to continue, I think people would disagree with me becsuse our world has a lot of problems with technology and should try and reduce how much technology is being used nowadays. Everyone uses technology to communicate with each other and now letting technology tell us everyones emotions can cause a lot of damage to our new world. It would take away our sempathy and empathy we have for people as we communicate with them about how they feel and using technology to tell us how someone feels is taking away the point of even talking about it because everyone already knows.

Lastly , I think getting this technology will help better our schools and help better our technology. Many things could go wrong with technology but with schools helping and participating giving the creator feedback on how it is working and what needs to be better about it. I think if enough schools participate in getting this technology we will come into better understanding with technology and each other. Thats why I think using technology to read emotion in school is a good idea.    ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
F8DB3025B057,"I am against of using the new technology software to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because I think it doesn't really matter to know how the students' emotions are unless they are getting work done and participating then its fine but other than that I disagree on having this technology to be used on students to know there emotions. If a student is feeling down you would really notice by their participation in the classroom and their facial expression if the student is into anything but if not why is it so important to just look real quick on the software of how the students emotional expression is? This new software thing is really cool and interesting in some way because its great how someone is able to create technology software to see how someone really feels when they are taking a picture if their "" happy, sad,angry,exhausted"" that's very interesting to find out,but i only think its not really a big of a deal to even to study it on students. So I strongly disagree to this option. I also would like to add I think it would be interesting for students to use as an essay in class for like a history class to do a project like this for any assignment because its very interesting to see examples as Mona Lisa really felt the day they took these photographs that made the picture so famous:how did they really feel. It would be a very enjoyable assignment for students to do.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

2C3D6DFE6768,"The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can do a lot more than just read emotions to us now. It can help us understand each other, help us answer questions we didn't have the power to answer, and help us become closer as a species. The human emotion is very hard to understand, but once you do your life can become a whole lot easier.

First I think that the technology is valuable because expressions are one of the keys of understand ourselves and each other. In the artical is states, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" I think expressions are a way to become a sentiant being to.

I also think its valubal because their are still lots of questons to be answered but can t because the lack of technology but most of it can be answered by just using this. In the text it states, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" all of the words said in the text were all just based af a 2D photo think what we can do with a photo that's already 3 dimensinal.

Finaly I think that as a spices that amotions sre one of the thing that can hold us back or bring us forward in the future but that just a hypothosis of what i think. In the text it states, ""Accoding to the facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving you facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" Emotions are one of the keys to our future and it's to early to tell but hopefully it will be special.

The human emotion is very hard to understand, but with every thing that is said in the artical you can only hope the computer really becomes something special for all of us to observe.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
81E072350B09,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System sounds like an excellent idea. It would allow schools to make classes more enjoyable for students. Teachers would know if the students are understanding the lessons. Teachers could know if students are stressing and help them calm down. The software would help provide better data for researchers. The program would benefit both students and teachers. It would also make getting data for research easier.

With the use of the new software, schools can provide a better learning environment. The program can tell people how the students respond to lessons and how they are taught. Teachers can take this information and use it to better their classrooms. They can make their lessons more interactive and fun. The software would allow for more labs to be performed in science classes. It might inspire students to go into science fields if they enjoy the F.A.C.S.

The technology could help teachers recognize struggling students. Many students will not say that they need help, even if they do. Teachers may be able to help brighten a student's day, so they do not spend the rest being sad. This could help prevent school ""accidents"" and keep the school's environment ""happier."" The F.A.C.S could help teachers know when the students need a minute's break to help them refocus.

The software could help researchers collect better data faster. Researchers would not need to go to schools to collect information. They could just take it from the program directly. This could help them improve the technology and make it more efficient. The information would help in other studies regarding schools or students. It could also alert people to dangers in the classrooms by detecting whenever students are scared.

The F.A.C.S would make the classrooms of schools better. They could make students safer. The schools could receive better feedback on what works and what does not. Researchers would get better information for studies. The systems would benefit more than just one. ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
8202209A4062,"This article is going to change the world toady as we know. If we allow our computers to identify human emotions, its a whole new way to look at life. People will be able to get what the want when they want because their computer will know when they are happy or mad at something. For instance, if you are online shopping and your face seems disgusted by a bright yellow shirt, the computer will see your expression and change the shirt to a blue one. By having that change be done for you, people will instantly become happier and have what they want right in front of them.

In my opinion, this new use of technolgy could be very helpful for many people. In the essay, it states the percent of emotions that the painting of Mona Lisa is. No one could ever be that spot on, so with the Facial Action Coding System, we now have the precise percents of what Mona Lisa's emotions are. By having these percents, we now have a blast to the past to think about what Leonardo da Vinci was thinking while painting this portrait. Maybe the reason she was mostly happy is because he was a genuinely happy person. It opens up a whole new door to what we can study and research. Since no one from back then is still alive today, this is our way of finding out not only what he was doing, but better yet what he was thinking! There is not a single machine that can do that today, so having this device would be a game changer.

Although the Facial Action Coding System would be an amazing new technology to have, many people could disagree with the system. Since having this system means that something, or even someone, is always watching you, people could feel that it is an invasion of personal space. They would alwasy feel like someone is there, even though no one is. It could lead to mental problems, such as thinking you are not alone and that people are watching your every move. Because of this, the system could be a bad call and lead to a bigger failure then they hoped. Today we are already facing problems with hackers hacking into our webcams and recording what we do without knowing it. This system is doing the exact same thing, but without the trouble of hacking. Unfortunately, it is already there with us knowing exactly what it is doing.

Although the Facial Action Coding System could have some problems, the success could be even bigger than the possible failure. Nothing like this has ever been made before, so the reaction to something like this could be endless. All in all, I believe that this new system is one that could change the world for good!",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
232662471F21,"One's feelings should not be used as some sience experiment. There are many people in the world who have feelings that they hide for persnal reasons, and for someone to get in someone else's head is not right. Emotions should not be calculated because it is an invasion of personal feelings, inner thoughts, and emotional expressions.

People have personal feelings that they dont want shared with everyone. In the article the author introduces a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that allows computers to recognize human emotions. However, this is a complete invasion of personal feelings because everybody has the right to a closed mind. The author has also said that, ""...you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Sometimes that's not always the case because people have inner thoughts as well tht they hide.

Another reason why emotions should not be calculated is because people have inner thoughts that they dont want shared as well. Through paragraph 5 it shows how people can see what other people are thinking based on their facial experessions, but that is not always true because some people hide their inner thoughts for the sake of others opinions and feelings. Inner thoughts should stay inner thoughts until the person thinking them is ready to share how they feel. The passage explains how most communication is non verbal, inlcluding emotional commmunication. Furthermore, this proves that if people cannot see certain emotions someone portrays to them than that someone doesnt want those emotions to be shown because it isnt that hard to pick certain emotions out by the way one is looking at you.

Lastly, people's emotions should not be calculated becasue it exposes their emotional expression. This article shows that people have a lot of expression and it can be determined with this Facial Coding machinery. People sometimes express emotions only to help another persons inner feelings. Using what the author has told about this system, for somebody to take a computer and actually go in your head to see what your actually feelings could not only expose yor emotional expression, but hurt someone else's feelings as well.

The invasion of personal feelings, inner thoughts, and emotional expression prove that emotions should not be calculated. People have the right to privacy, even if its only the mind, and this system reveals their secret emotions that should not have to be revealed through test.

F324DBEBCAFA,"Technology To Read Emotions

In this article they share about the Facial Acting Coding System. They ask us if we agree with it or not. My answer would be yes, I think there is nothing wrong with it. My personal opinon is it is actually kind of cool. This can really help people out knowing others emotions.

The reason I think there isn't anything wrong with this is because I dont see its harming anything. When I said it could help people I was refering to when they said that it can show when someone is bored and that the teacher could try to make it less boring. If I was a teacher or I wondered hiow someone is I9 would want to use this.

Another reason this is helpful is that it can detect when someone is feeling down or mad or something else. When someone sees what it detected they can see if the student needs someone to talk to or help. When a teacher uses this and they see that the student is bored and not focus they could try to make it fun or do something at the moment and make the focus and awake.

This system can be compareded to peoples thoughts on what some are feeling. There are some people that can almost do the same as this. But this system can do it pretty fast and tell yus exactly everything. They say when you do this you move your muscles and whatever ones you usae can make you happy. Which I think is cool and smart.

In conclusion I totally agree with this. Almost everything I put is my feeling on this Facial Action Coding System. Overall I can say it can really help some people out and that it is very smart. This is a thing they could use in an everyday thing. It could aso correct how people feel about teachers lessons or just anything like that.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

The Facial Action Coding System improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of humans and detects how people truly feel even when they are trying to hide their emotions. Facial Action Coding System would be effective and valuable in reading emotional expressions of students in the classroom because;

Classroom computers would be able to know when they need to modify the lesson when they notice the students look bored or confused and that could make learning more effective to students. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it would modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This shows how learning can be made much more easier and fun.

The facial action coding system would be effective in classrooms because it would make computer-animated faces more expressive when teaching. ""The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery, most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication"". Sometimes muscle clues might be wrong because sometimes people might not be able to indicate a genuine smile and a forced one but facial action coding system would be able to detect when students are happy and when they are lying.

""Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"".

1D549C77CB16,"There are mny factors that influence using technology to read emotions in the classroom. The technoogy can influence certain lessons based on given understanding. Facial expression evaluated by these computers could help teachers. This kind of technology could benefit the future as well. Lesson planning, teacher help, and futue technology are three factors that contribute to using emotional expressions for the classroom.

Facial exression are a elling sign of the current state of emotion a person is in. These emotionas are universal for people to understand, such as a smile representing a good mood of a friend. Now computers are able to tell emtions based of facial muscles, which has led to innovations in the classroom environment. For example, if a student is working on a homework assignment and gives off a look of confusion, the computer can tell that the student is struggling to understand whatthe question or problem is asking or how to solve the problem. This new technology could benefit the student in that the lesson could be mdified to help the comprehension of the learner.

This technology could help teachers ina sense that they have easier communication with their students. Since teachers have to teach a multitude of students, it can be difficult for the teacher to see who is struggling with the material presented, Most communicaton between people is done through that of emtional communication rather than verbal. From that this formof technology can help teachers know who comprehends themaerial, who is confused by the directions or the material, or those who simply do not understand the content. Using this facial expression technology can be of beneficiary to those in educaion.

Emotion technology can be of benefit to not only the school evironmwnt but also can open new doors for the future. Even though the algorithm is not compatible with a normal PC at home, this technology could benefit in the future for new innovations such as helping a students interest levels for at home assignments. The only slight flaw that could go against this facial software is that computers cannot detect genuine emotion. Such as a person hiding certain emotions that are not shown on a facial expression. However more advancement and developments of this technology in the future could benefit many people in different circumstances.

Many factors of Facial Action Coding System can help benefit students in a classroom. Three factors significantly hold value to the influence of this software. Students can be able to have customized lessons to maximize learning in that subject based of assinments completed on the emotiion recognizing software. Teachers will be able to communicate better with students in helping undrestand the content and what needs to be focused on more. Future softwares can be made from this intial technology that can recognize students understanding and comprehension of the material from at home assignments on possiby a PC. Overall, the ability to recognize emotions of students from muscle movements of the face is a great advanncemet for the classroom enviroment, and once more developments are made, man students will benfit in being able to understand the material beter.

B3A71739C324,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I think using the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read students' emotional expressions in a classroom. I think this because if a student is bored or tired, you can tell just by their face on how they feel. Also, this new technology system could help humans learn how to use their muscles in order to make them smile again. In the next two paragraphs, I will explain using eveidence from this article on how this is true.

Using the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System shows how you feel just by the look on your face. In paragraph 5 it states ""In face, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look her on face... Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions... His new computer software update stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" This statement from the text is saying how humans show emotions just by their face. This detail states how using the new technology shows us more on how a person is feeling.

The new technology called the Facial Action Coding System also shows humans on how to learn to move their facial muscles. In paragraph 9 it states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help you produce them... Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" This is stating that if you use your facial muscles, you can actually start to feel slightly happy. This detail explains how using your facial expressions can actually make you feel slightly happy.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" this new technology the Facial Action Coding System is valuable with students in a classroom. We can tell by students' faces on how they feel, but the new technology helps us figure out their emotions even more. The technology is a very good use if you want to figure out someone's emotions. This can also help students realize what they actually feel and start moving their facial muscles to make them feel slightly happy again.

70954F3B8FBC,"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" talks about a software that has been developed to percieve the emotions of others. This software determined that the Mona Lisa is 83 penrcent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry.

For sure is an interesting project, because sometimes we want to know how other people is feeling, but, this improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of the others as it is said on this article?

Dr. Huang explain how the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, but I think every human has different expressions, or they can hide them pretty well. For example: in a movie you can have a great actor. This actor can make perfect facial expression, as he was really feeling the situation; being truly sad, happy, scared etc. but he is an actor, and this feelings that he is showing for a specific situation on the movie, are not real. Those problems are not happening in his real life.

This actor can hide his emotions, and this software that can predict your emotions won't know that. So I think it's impossible know how people is feeling with just a software that works just by facial expression, because human feelings are more complex that this, and that's why whe have to study human behavior, or how their brains work with different feelings as love. Because humans are more complex than just an expression that you can hide.

In conclusion, sometimes, when people let you see their feelings, this program can work to show you the percents of your facial expression, but is not an accuracy way to do it because behind the human behavior there are more things to think about it if we are talking about feelings, and this may not be always the correct answer to the feelings of a person.

Emotions are a strange thing, and not evryone is going undertsatnd you just based off of your looks. There is something called FACS (Facial Action Coding System) that classifies our six basic emotions which are happiness, suprise, anger, disqust,fear, and sadness. The computer constructs a 3-D model of the face and they rely on the muscles in the face to expose it all. All of this came from the relaization that no one knows exactly the expression on the painting ""The Mona Lisa""'s face.

Some have observed the face so much, they can just tell how you're feeling.

Like, in fact if someone close to me were feeling some type of way, I would be able to tell based off of their face expression unless it's ""just their face"".

Not everyone is the same because ""most human contact and/or communication is nonverbal, icluding emotional communication"" which is stated from the text. Technology has helped alot though in this, especially researchers, psychologists and most likely scientists.

In conclusion, The Mona Lisa painting face expression isn't unknown anylonger.

Also many kids may think that its a bad idea but trying different things in the classroom could help many kids out. And the teachers would love that. But even if its not good the teacher wouldn't have to keep using it. In the artcle the author says, ""Hold on! Can we actually ""calcuate"" emotions - like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to espress how we feel?"" (D'Alto 2). Here the author makes a good point. Could this really would? How is it possible? Is it helpful? And there are many more quetions that I'm sure people have about it. But trying something new and seeing if technology like this could really be valuable is wroth trying out. Also this would be a good thing becasue kids would learn about art. The Mona Lisa is very famous and many people know about it. And learning more about it would be great thing for the kids in the classroom. I can see why many people wouldn't like it in thier classroom though. Maybe the teacher doesn't like art. Or maybe they don't know that much about art. But even if that's the reason for not trying this out I believe it would be good for the kids and they would learn something new and different.

9EAD1B4831C7,"Mona Lisa face expressions are different than others face's, depending on how the person look with no smile, no anger, and no saddness. The emotional communication is nonverbal, showing the more emotion there is though our face's. Smile' are all differnet depending if it's a real one or a forced one. Faces don't lie, Smiling isn't being truthful they said. Willing to put on a face, it usually works most of the time, but not only to expresses emotion, it's tells us how they are feeling today or what they are going though.

When actors fake a smile or a frown they don't feel it really, they just make the face to prove or hide what they are feeling or showing. They act the show and give what's on the paper and have the same movement that we humans have to use when we express how we feel.

We have six basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and there is sadness. They associated with each of our characteristics movements of the facial muscules. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" We have some software tracks on these facial movement that our brain follows, it can find out you're mix emotion and expression by you're neutral face. This not means what you can really see without the tech and just see the real feeling and the real smile or their sadness. This Facial Action Coding System is identifing the moment of the face right that minute, but not what they are feeling right after or before.

What I'm tryig to say is that our computers are blind and won't see what's really happening, our faces can lie to computers but not to people who know's what they been though and can see in other human their self. You got to see it deep into their eyes and smile if they are really happy or just really sad within their ife.

If a student is not understanding the lesson they will most likely lower there eye brows and in towards each other. This shows they dont understand what is going on. This will allow the computer to see why the student is not understanding or bord about. Than the computer will see this and modify the lesson so that the student will understand what is going on.

if a students is learning math on there computer and they are having trouble understanding what they are doing. The computer will see that they need help and it will most likely pull up a easyer way to solve the problems.

Having a school that will allow students to use this kind of technology may end up making it easyer for the student to understand there classwork or even homework. So this will allow the students to get better grades and having better understanding on the subject later on in life.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
5C7BD98F4B35,"Using this techlonogy of Facial Action Coding System would be very useful and valuable to be used in a classroom.

There's are several of reasons why It's a good idea to use this genuis technique in class.

To start off It's pretty incrible that a computer can see what emotion you are feeling. Why not use it? It'll come in pretty handy. Let's just say that a student In the class is never doing their work. They're constantly distracted and they don't show any effort. The computer can tell us what emotion the student is feeling so then that way It'll not only be helpful for the teacher to know what's going on but it'll also be helpful to the student so that the teacher helps the student not to struggle so much.

It can also help with students that are confused and aren't sure how they are feeling or mayeb they feel a lot of things at once which is very confusing a computer than can show what your feeling is a good tool. It can help you firgure out what your feeling In cas you don't know how you feel.

Same with teachers. Students can firgure out what their teacher is feeling that way they can avoid getting into trouble. If they see a teachers angry they wouldn't wanna make them more mad.

As in for students. With this cool technology it can help students find out what's going on in case they have a friend who they're worried about and they're not so sure what's going on with their friend. Well this computer can quickly help you figure out what's going on with them. Im sure your friend would really appriciate that you help them out even if it seems like they don't.

These are the reasons I think that using this computer that show what emotions you've got is simply very helpful to both students and teachers. It's a smart way in not only showing how you feel but also producing them. ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
9FCF0C8C83C3,"After reading the passage I came to the conclusion that some ways I think it's not valueble . FACS would be a smart tool for case workers or counslers . Some case workers deal with people who have emotion diseases such as post dramaic stress diseases in that nature . I feel like the creator could've made the tool for more serious reason, not that the emotion FACS was pointless but who would want to just find out their emotion and they can already feel it or going through it.

I feel like people would want to find out things more important like , whats going with that person , is the person feeling sick , is the person healthy . FACS could been about how's the day going to go , whats the weather going to be like . I feel like FACS is all hype in some way because it's basic , like yay we can see how we feel right?

They took all this time and objects figure how someones doing or feelings , instead of how we're living . Anyone can figure out someone's emotion expresses by their body language , their tone , how their speaking , when their speaking and etc. Often people may not want to speak on how they feel , alot of times teens want to keep their problems and emotions to them selves. Students are diffrent from adults, and also handle emotions diffrently.

FACS would be valueble if they come with conclusions to that person emotion at the time , plenty of ways technology can do things. If the FACS were a solution to a person with a bad day it would be valueble. Due to the fact their making this like it's a cool invention when FACS is exposing peoples feelings and then wat after that? I feel like the FACS should be upgraded and do more with it .

The use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a great way to see if someone is happy. It can possibly help others to see the person in front of them and what their emotions are or what that person is 'trying to hide'

It's all about muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (the muscles that begin at the cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth.

The muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around the eyes. But in a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity is not being thruthful.

Making a fake smile can also help produce a real one. Practicing with putting a pencil across your mouth works the same muscles as when a person is smiling for real.

This project does help in forms that can tell when someone is being sad, happy, disgusted, surprised, angry, fearful, and/or sad. ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
8459600E47B0,"Facial Action Coding System doesn't seem to bad until there comes a day where you want no one knowing how you're feeling. In the article, the author explains what this technology can do. So far, the article does a job identifying your emotional expressions, ""according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions"" (D'Alto 1). I am against the value of using this technology to read students thoughts or feelings. There are days when you want your own thougths and feelings kept to yourself, privacy, and as well as being able to learn something new everyday.

There come days when you don't want peope knowing how you're feeling and for some odd technology to just assume your feelings is just not adding up to me. The article shows a picture of the young Mona Lisa sort of smiling. Yes, she doesnt seem to happy, but is she? Only she knows. I dont agree with the computer system judging her feelings. ""Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearfull, and 2 percent angry"" (D'Alto 1). To me, she looks like she's being forced to smile but like I said, only she knew her feelings while the picture was being taken. I don't believe that should be a thing, no one should be told how they are feeling. If we as humans dont really have a reason to judge, why should technology be able to.

Along with that, the article talks about ""a classroom computer could recogize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (D'Alto 1). Recognizing it could allow teachers to change their lessons, due to students being bored. How come? Daily there are students who complain about how boring a class is. No one forces them to come. Students come to school to learn, we don't expect to have fun. If a technology were to let teachers know when students were bored they'd be changing subjects seconds, by seconds. Students in that case, would be happy to act bored just for the sake of it. Less learning would accure if it were for the technology to detect kids who don't care about school who are constantly ""bored"". No one said school is fun, but neither should a technology detecting students feelings should get in the way of learning.

In the meantime, we have trouble understanding people. To allow a technology to have the power to easily understand thoughts, feelings of us humans is just critical. Allowing a technology to determine your friend's feelings is overrated according to my calculations. ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisly enough to convey specific emotions"" (D'Alto 1). I don't believe something so ordinary could barge in and make us feel disturbed knowing not someone but something knows the way we're feeling.

Therfore, I am against this value of using this type of technology to read students emotional expressions. I believe there are different types of people in this world. There are days where you don't want to share your feelings to people, so why technology. If we are willing to share our thoughts, we will. Not have something so unusal do that job for us.                                                ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
B2EFB184CBFB,"Yes, I do think that we should use the Facial Action Coding in classroom. The reason why I say yes is because students do get bored and frustrated when doing notes or homework and even inclass work. The Facial Action Coding would allow the teachers to really see how or what there students emotions when it comes to doing there work, the teacher can change things up to making the class fun when they are doing note or work. Also the teacher can understand what's going on with his or her students in the classroom to see if they are struggling or if they get on how to do the work. I think math teachers would really would like to have this because, they would be able to tell if the students are lying to them on if they get it or if they don't get it. So the teacher would be able to help the students more that are struggling with the work. Also other classes than just math the teachers would be able to use it for helping there students in class that are actually not getting on how to do the work or if they do or don't understand the note. Like in a history class alot of time it can be very confusing and the students don't understand on how to do the teacher would be able to know if they really get it or they are just lying straight to there faces. The teachers would also know if they are having a good or a bad day, if they student is having a bad day they could some how cheer them up to make them happier in there class or the rest of the day.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
23C916766386,"I think that this type of technology could be very helpful but it could also be very scary if it isn't used properly. But, if it is only used for classroom use I think it could be very effective. There are plenty of ways this new technology could help schools help students learn better. Especially, if it could help kids learn the best way they can.

Face recognition is also used in the new IPhone X and there are already a whole bunch of new conspiracy theories about it. I think that is because humans have never seen this kind of technology used before, which can lead us to overthink and come up with crazy ideas in our heads because we don't fully understand this new technology. I feel as though Facial Action Coding System would get the same reaction at first which could probably affect schooling in general. Parents might hear negative stuff about this new technology and send their kids to different schools or start home schooling them, which would not be very good for the school's image. Of course, the talk would die down at some point but people might still be reluctant at first.

On the other hand, I think once all the suspicions do die down it would be a tremendous help to the school. As the passage was saying, that it could recognize if the student is getting bored it could change the way the lesson is being taught. I think this would help because everyone learns in a different way. It also was talking about if the student was confused and I was thinking maybe they could even just re-word how the lesson is explaining the material.

But, I do think the ad thing could be kind of annoying. Yes, it might help somewhat, but I, as do many other people, don't really like ads to begin with. Especially if they just pop up out of nowhere and onto my screen. It could help promote more things but I don't think that most people that are on the recieving end of these ads would be very fond of the idea.

In conclusion, I think that this technology could be very helpful ,maybe even cool, if used correctly and with a lot of testing and patience. You're gonna need patience because of all the theories I talked about because no one knows how long that could last. But, nevertheless, I think that it would be entirely worth it.

Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The use of this computer is very helpful for lots of people.

The software that is used in this computer can tell your emotion in a real face or in the painted face of Mono Lisa. It uses video imagery. It can tell the students emotion of how they feel.

DBF4A7FBD000,"Using the Facial Actrion Decoding System in the classroom would be valuable. There are many benifits to using this program in classrooms. Many students do not enjoy the time they send in school, so this could be a revolutionary approach to changing the way the American school system works.

One of the reasons the decoding system would help students is that it could help inhance student's grades. Because thecomputeris actively trying to bring the student's mood up, it could hep them to fully enjoy the information they are given. If the computer is constantly trying to inhace emotions, liking the material will cause the student to enjoy learning more. If a student truely enjoys what they are learning, they will work harder to do well in a class.

Another reason the decoding system would be benifitial to classrooms isbecause it could help students understand the concepts better. Not liking classroom material results in students not fully understanding the material and not wanting to pay attention. They soon become easily sidetrack and loose sight of remembering the information later on. Knowing that they enjoy the concepts will help with the understanding of the material. As stated in the text, "" A classroom computer could recongnise when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and also states, "" Then it can modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Some might argue that a human instructor may be able to do just as well relaying information as the computer, but most of the time a teacher must give the material to the class as a whole, and can'tfocus soley on individual emotions of the student, and if every student is enjoying the lesson.

The last reason why the coding system would be benifitial is because it could help with teenage mood swings and depression. teens seem to be less happy when they are confused and overwhelmed by schoolwork, and helping to adjust the material based of their moods could help increase their level of happiness. Helping to improve their happiness during school hours might in turn help them to be more happy overall.

The Facial Action Coding can help you read fully what this person is feeling.

For examples The Facail Coding System can tell if you're faking your smile to keep from showing how you really feel teachers wouldnt know how you feel unless you tell them whats going on with you. Using the coding system can tell the teacher your emtions that way they can deal with it and move forward in your learning. Not only just a happy and sad emotion the system can consist but when the teacher is teaching the lesson she can tell if the students get in by the expression on their face the sensor can tell weather or not the student is fustrated or confused on what the he/she is teaching. The teacher can get a percentage of the students emotions about the lesson if teacher gets the results and they show simlar patterns of confusion among the she can revist the lesson . In paragraph 6 it states when the compture predicts how the student is feeling it can ""modify the lesson "" I believe that it'll help the student learn the lesson like everybody else is in their own way because everybody has different levels of learning

The author uses the famous painting of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci as an example of emotion(s) the computer can detect. However, the new technology is a valuable advantage because it can express all emotions one could feel that could create a positive impact for greater educational opportunites in the future.

The 3-D model of the Facial Action Coding System is described to have a human-like appearance with joints like the human muscle. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individulas often show varying degrees of expression""(Huang). The future of technology is rapidly changing and adapting to become smarter and more like a human mind set. Like humans, the computer can detect if someone may be feeling one way through facial expressions. For example, ""We humans perform this same impressive 'caculation' everyday. For instance, you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Logically, if a close friend claim to say they might feel one way but you might feel they aren't expressing themselves like that. ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions...Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of 'Da Vinci Code'!""

""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

The use of FACS can be a valuable source in the future to involve computers in communication. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that too."" From a scientific and professional point of view, Dr. Huang indicates that computers should be involved with emotions. It is valuable to say that technology to read emotional expressions of students in classrooms is indeed an advantage that can greatly impact their learning envoirnments. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" From this quote, it is foreshadowing that future education is likely to be involved of more computer activity. The medical and political field could receive a positive impact from this as well.

Using this on humans isn't a good thing. If they want to keep an emotion hidden then I don't think it is a good idea to uncover it. How can the world be a positive place if the happy people who made you happy weren't actually happy. What if that person had a death of a family member and wanted to keep it a secret but some random person starts snooping around and tells everyone that that person isn't actually happy. Since the article can tell a fake smile from a real smile it could possibly happen. Now if the person gives you consent then it is fine but nobody should be able to read someones emotion.

Now the thing about the facial recognition being in a classroom might make it more interesting. It there was a way to make school more interesting than that would be great.

Then what, what are you suppose to when you find out everyone in your class either bored or upset you cant talk to everyone about their emotions not most people would want to open up, Which is understandable because you didnt come to school to have your teacher read your facial expression and start to anaylze everything about you.

BAC14C5693CD,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author is describing a new technology, one that enables computers to identify human emotions. This could be valuable in the classroom for both a student and a teacher. Many teachers can find a hard time to deal with students because of things that could be going on at home. Teachers can find it hard to also help students if they don't know how they are feeling. Facial Action Coding system can help those teachers understand what a student is feeling.

For example, Sarah has a lot of family issues going on at home. She comes to school, doesn't feel like doing her work and her teacher want's to help her but doesn't know how to approach her. This technology can help the teacher get a better understanding on what Sarah is feeling and even ask her why she feels that certain emotion. This can build up a good relationship between a student and a teacher. A lot of students don't have good relationships with teachers because some teachers could say the wrong thing which leads to the student not wanting to say anything.

In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang states that ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", this also could a help a teacher to know what type of assignments or projects that she/he could give to the class so the students wouldnt be bored or confused. This could also give insight to the teacher on what she/he feels like they should do better in there lectures or what their teaching to the class.

In my personal expierence, I knew a lot of teachers who didn't know how to approach me because they either didn't know what to say or how to say the right thing. If my teachers had this type of technology built into the school computers and could see through their computer how student's and myself were feeling. I would have a much better relationship with most of my teachers because they would have known what I'm feeling, whether i'm feeling sad or angry.

In my conclusion, the Facial Acting Coding System would be valuable of students in a classroom because it could both help students and a teacher to be able to build a strong, trusting relationship and also giving insight to one another.

I believe that i would keep many fights from happening because would be abe to stop it befor it happens even though the technology dosnt tell what your thinking it could extress your emothions and someone could just atlk to you about what going on before it was the go any farther.

This would save student teachers etc from bring weapons into a school setting to protect themselves.

Also this would be a goood idea because in school some studen are just to shy to raise their hand in class to ask a question they would ofect express being confused through facial expressions and the teacher would be able to tell their confused, it would seperate the confused ones from the ones who understand.

There are plenty of reasons for why to use this technology. One reason could be that it will detect when a student is bored or is becoming confused. Another reason that it should be used is that it would help inprove the lesson or what is being taught. Also most human communication is non verbal, so then the computers need to understand that.

One example on why the technology should used is how it will be able to detect when someone feels a certain way in a class or a lesson. The text states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""(D'Alto). This would help students and teachers because from the students prespective the teacher would know how he/she felt. A way that this would help teachers would be that it would give the teachers some feedback so that maybe if their student is bored to make their lesson a little energetic. Then the students and the teachers may have more understanding of eachother.

Another reason that would make this technology valuable would be that it would help improve a lesson for the students when needed. The text states, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor""(D'Alto). This is refering to the last point. So if a student is bored, the computer would recognize the problem and change the lesson for the student so they could be more enthusiastic about the lesson. For example if a student is borred about learning about geography, and the student is bored then the computer could change up their lesson by watching a movie that follows what the person is learning about.

Also another reason for using the technology in a classroom about how a lot of human communication is not even talking to someone it is more body language than anything. The text says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication""(D'Alto). This means that not everything is about just talking to someone but there is also a lot that goes on with their body, facial expressios, the list goes on. For example a person can a have a converstion with someone and not even mean what they are saying, and the computers would be able to tell using their facial expressions and body language.

Whether a person think that this new technology is completely useless or not, this could help for students to learn more, and have interest in learning. This could help students by actually learning and doing better in school, because they would be able to fully understand each concept. For example if a student is confused with something and the teacher doesn't notice it the computer will, and it will change the lesson so that the student can get a grasp of the subject. maybe this new technology shouldn't be introduced into a classroom, but it would be of much help.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
DA56D30A7A9A,"Wow! Us humans now live in day where something can read our emtions, that is pretty cool. Having the ""Facial Action Coding System"" would be very nice to have in a classroom. That would make it easier for the staff of the school to know what students like.

The man that made this ""Facial Action Coding System"" was, Prof. Thomas Huang. Thomas Huang was working with Prof. Nicu Sebe. Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are trying to get a way for humans and computers to communicate. What Prof. Nicu Sebe and Prof. Thomas are doing can help students in school.

Now how it works is pretty cool. In the article it says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face."" This would help teachers read what emtion a student is giving during class.

How will this effect students and teachers. How would this help the teachers? The computer will scan the students face see if they are focusing in class or not. In the article says that the computer can read ""action unit"" which is, ""Movement of one or more muscles."" Telling if the student is focusing in class.

This idea of a computer reading someones face isn't that bad. It would help out students in the future.        ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
126BF47F3939,"The use of this technology for a classroom full of students will not be valuable. Although it would be interesting to see what the students are feeling during a lesson. How is the data going to be of use in science? The students can express their feelings, but what are the researchers going to do with this information. This technology should be used, but not in the classroom.

If we do end up using the system to detect emotions where will the data go. It will help the video game industry with the evidence from paragraph 6 ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery."" Why only put this into a classroom put it into the robots we are building today so they seem more human-like, so they can become more advanced than a ordinary robot. The direction the researchers are taking are great, but the choice of where to put it needs to be different. Just putting it into a classroom would be a waste of time and money.

There is so much wasted potential if the system is put into a classroom.

we could use this technology for bigger and better things. For instance better facial recognition security systems so it can be more accurate reading faces and does not open or let in anyone that looks like the person. Or lock the person out of anything that is protected by facial recognition. Another example of how this could be useful in other ways is the facial recognition can be used in the police force to find a match of a person that was caught on camera to be tracked down and captured. The way that the researchers are using it for is inefficient and wasteful and should not be implemented in classrooms.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
946C874A9CCD,"The science of emotion recognition is complex and is becoming exponentially more complex the further a topic is being disscused. In the realm of arguing weather the use of emotional recognition technology should be used in a classroom can be a very difficult tquestion. On one side, you can say it may invade privacy, but on the other hand, it could help teachers see if students are understanding the topic. The question still lies on which one is more important for both the student and the teacher. In my opinion, this technology should be implemented into classrooms internationally because it will help students learn more effectivley, but also it will enhance the teachers teaching ability when they know where they're students are going array.

This technology could be very benificial for students across the globe. The ability for a piece of technology to understand your emotions could come in handy. There are many outgoing students, but there are also many introverted students. Some students may not feel confident enough to ask for something to be repeated, so they may simply sit at their desks puzzeled for the rest of the class, while a simple question could've avoided this. If this technology is instituted, it will automatically know when a student isn't confident on the information and alert the teacher. By doing this, the introverted student won't be confused for very long and the topic could be revisited without the student to have to personally ask. It not only will help introverted students, but students across the board. Every student will benifit form this technology and will display in their grades. With this technology, the students acedemic achievements will expand exponentially. Becuase of this ability for teachers to understand their emotions, the quick turn around of revisiting the topic and teaching it a little differently could help the students absorb all the information, especially the information that they mau have not conprehended initally. This technology will be very valuable for the students for both their enjoyment throughout school becuase of the reduced stress, and their improvents in acedemic grades.

This technology is not only bennifical to the students, but to the teacher as well. For the teacher they will automatically know if a student is struggling and in what topic. Thius could be very valuable to create a strong teacher studnent realtionship where the teacher is able to understant the smallest change in emotion to when they're confused or if they understamd it. This relationship could improving the learning environment and how comfortable a student with their students and peers. This technology could help teachers in both big and small schools. In big lecture halls, it may seem to be difficult for a professor to understand the emotions of all the students sitting before them, they might not even be able to see everyone because some may sit further away. With this new technology, teachers could be notified when some students become confused and then revisit a topic. Small classrooms could benifit greatly to this as well. Althought they are in a closer proximity then in lecture halls, they still will have the issue of not understanding the emotions which could lead to confusion. In smaller classrooms the teacher could know what they're doing wrong and be able to fix this easily without having to disturb the students. They can evaluate the emotions throughout the lesson and then later, they can change their lesson plans to adapt to the confusion of the students. This is again, a very valuable piece of technology that could help the teachers grow in their profession.

Initally one may think that this technology is redundant and that a teacher could just help the student, and that it may be invading the students privacy. In reality, this technology continues to prove its many values, and it's evergrowing amount of benifits that completly overpower all the ideas that some may think its unnimportant. This technology is valuable to both teachers and students equally. The teachers are able to improve their teaching techniques and the students understand more in school. This technology, however, is nowhere near done. This technology can be further improved in many aspects. I could keep improving and always creating a smarter version of the present day technology, that may one day, change the course of education forever. This could be implemented in the online schools to understand if a student comprehends the information the value of this is unspeakable and should be institued in classrooms globally.

In paragraph 6 it stated that ,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored Dr. Huang predicts, Then it could modify the lesson"".

Using this new technology I think would help schools out a lot because it would help them understand what a student is thinking everyday at school. In the article it states ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait"" this system could see through your expressions and right to what you're thinking.

This new technology would be very intresting to have in a classroom just so the teachers could know what you are thinking emotionally. I can kind of see where this could be interupting your privacy but sometimes a teacher should know if your having a hard time or if your even bored in class. Knowing your getting bored in there class would make me as a teacher want to try something differently. Just by reading this article the machine sounds kind of cool it can read what your emotions are just by scanning your face, thats crazy.

Finally after my opinion this machine hopefully you agree with me on this because some schools might wanna try it out. Some teachers need to know what there students are thinking and you know 90 percent are probably going to be bored. So now it is up to the teachers to make it less boring because they know now that your not interested in what they're teaching.

E616F60C349F,"I believe that having facial recognition technology in a classroom would be beneficial to everyone involved. It would allow for the students to be put back on track if they are distracted or bored. It would also aide the teachers by giving them feedback that they might've never recieved before. Lastly, as a domino effect, it would help the entire world because we would be making the education system for our future a lot better.

Firstly, if we had facial recognition technology in the classrooms, it would allow for our students to recieve a better education. For example, a student is in class one day and a teacher is giving a lecture that they are just not interested in or don't quite understand so that student's mind begins to wander because they are bored. With the facial recognition, that student would be detected as distracted, bored, or even confused so the teacher can make adjustments to the learning space and/or the way that the material is being taught. This technology would help the students who would normally be confused and too shy to say anything, recieve help and better understand what they are having issues with.

Secondly, this facial recognition technology would be very helpful to teachers who would work with it. They would be getting direct feedback from the class without them even having to say anything. If the class is confused, the teacher can work around the confusion and readjust. This would ensure that students achieve the most information possible and would, therefore, make our teachers and the education system a lot better.

Lastly, I believe that the entire world could benefit from this technological advancement. Our world is changing and adavancing technologically very quickly and we have to be able to keep up. As the world gets smarter, we must get smarter with it. Better technology in the classroom means better learning which means even better, smarter pupils. Any technological advancement that makes our future doctors, surgeons, lawyers, etc. smarter then, I believe, must be put into use right away. We would be securing our future as a nation.

To conclude, the implementing of better technology in any form would be very good. Everyone would benefit from this technology in the education system. That is why I believe that it would be very valuable to implement the technology talked about in this essay in the classroom.      ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
9500B623A6AC,"Have you ever been sitting in class wondering what emotions the students around you are feeling? Have you ever wondered how to make things less boring and confusing in the classroom? Well now you can with the all new Facial Action Coding System. It's a system that can figure out the emotions that you are feeling just from your facial expressions.

I feel as if this could help in the classroom but not as much as Dr. Huang thinks. I think that yes it would help with making class less boring and/ or confusing but it can also just lead to even more frustation or sadness. It also isn't going to help if you are sitting in front of an actual human teacher and not a computer. If a student if feeling strong emotions such as saddness or fear; they need to talk to a friend about it, someone they can trust, not a computer.

So in conclusion, I give this system about a 50% chance of it helping in the classroom like Dr. Huang says it will.

This kind of technology in the classrooms would be a nessestiy for teacher to effectivy teach to thier students, and idetify when they need help, or when they are getting bored during thier lesson.

Studnets get bored during class, and dont pay attention becuase of that. Students also get confused during class, but sometimes a bored student can get confused with a student that is confused on what the teacher is taling about and needs help. The FACS would change that, becuase teacher would be able to analyze whether their students are either board or confused, or enjoying their lessons.. It would also help teacher identify which lessons thier students are enjoying, and would be able to use that data to plan which lessons to include, and which lessons or activitys to throw away becuae they are boring and would not do the theire students any good.""'A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Haung predicts 'Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor""' (D'Alto).

64FD220F0DF7,"Emotions are a vital part of human life. Although they are sometimes overlooked or seem to not be present simply by looking at someone's face, they are used every day. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" introduces information regarding a technology which is able to detect the most common emotions. While this invention is widely seen as incredible, if not revolutionary, the Facial Action Coding System's presence is not valuable in classrooms.

The Facial Action Coding System does not have much value when it comes to using this technology to read students' emotinal expressions. The technology itself, while advanced in certain ways, is not that much more effective than a teacher's or students's abiltiy to distinguish feelings. The author, in his article presenting the many positives of this technology, addresses the idea that the system is able, from a 3D model it has built, to analyze the msucles of the face, matching their activity to certain basic emotions. The technology's ability to recognize emotions based on facial features and human behavior is something that humans have been doing automatically for centuries. The specific muscle structure is not necessary to determining one's feelings, as their use show noticeable changes on the face and are visible to the naked eye. Although this might be quicker, the technology would not have much value for classroom situations, as teachers could easily, while paying more attention to their students, notice the same details, identify changes in emotion, and alter their ways of teaching accordingly. Overall, the human's ability to identify basic emotional expressions would render this technology rather unvaluable in classrooms.

Similarly, the purely scientific origin of the Facial Action Coding System decreases the value this technological innovation would have for students in a classroom. While it might be successful in identifying the emotions of students, the Facial Action Coding System relies purely on the muscle behavior and structure, as mentioned in the article, meaning that no other factors would be taken into consideration. Many factors other than emotion, such as fatigue, can alter a student's appearance or behavior. The coding system would most likely, as a result of these underlying factors, as well as the very limited amount of emotions it can perceive, make the technolgy unvaluable when comes times to read student's emotional expressions. The generalization of emotions detected would produce false or unaccurate results, rendering the program useless in classrooms. The Facial Action Coding System, due to its computerized nature and lack of human perception, would not be a valuable addition to classrooms.

The lack of privacy this new technology brings makes the invention unvaluable. While some may think this to be a good way to improve student's lives throughout the school day, this facial recognition would raise many questions and controversy regarding student privacy. As the author states in the article, the Facial Action Coding System could be implemented in computers with the purpose of regulating ads and personalizing them to someone's preferences, likes, and dislikes. This is not only unnecessary, but would mean having a constant stream of visual information regarding students being sorted and analyzed. If this were implemented in classrooms, a number of parents and students alike would find this to be an intrusion of privacy, resulting in complaints, debates and overall unnecessary problems added to the education system. While this innovation might be somewhat useful or bring more attention to student's feelings, the excessive problems and controversy it would create makes the student emotional expression detector technology unvaluable and not a good addition to school.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The technology, although it could properly analyze the muscles and facial structure of students in classrooms, could easily be matched by a teacher, does not take in all possible factors, and would conjure up many questions regarding privacy in schools. While this program would have little to no value in classes, it could provide help to investigative work.

To prove that this technology can be used in advance, most of us know the famous picture of the Mona Lisa.

Obviously we have more then one feeling but this is an prime example of showing this can work on other people and pictures from years ago and still show their full emotions, most people can claim to be happy a lot and be completley devasted.

D941FABC82E0,"New technologies are always interesting and beneficial towards any aspect of life. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) measures your facial muscles to calculate your emotions. Because there are characteristic movements of muscles when expressing different emotions, the FACS can recogonize the muscle movement and record the emotion. This newly discovered technology has great potential to be useful in several areas, such as understanding facial expressions, animating facial emotions, and commercial use. However, the use of FACS technology is not valuable in the classroom.

First, the FACS's ability to read emotions is not useful in the classroom. It can tell when students are bored, or when students are unhappy with the teaching method, but it cannot change the students' emotions immediately. The best it can do is notify the instructor to change their lesson, as stated in the passage. This itself is not a huge benefit, and is not valuable enough to justify the use of the FACS technology in every classroom.

Secondly, the FACS is very recent, advanced, and expensive. As stated in the passage, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (D'Alto, 7). If a home PC cannot run the FACS program because of its complexity, how would an impoverished school be able to provide this technology to every classroom? The cost of this technology to be placed in every classroom is a waste of money and time. Instead of being used in classrooms, this technology could play an important role in the study of art, such as Mona Lisa, or the creation of expressive virtual faces to be put in use for video surgery or virtual reality. The very limited benefits the FACS brings in the classroom does not outweigh the cost and effort of providing it.

In short, the FACS is a newly designed program that has potential to be applied in many different fields of study, but is not practical for the classroom. The ability to read students' emotions is both unimportant and eerily disturbing. The FACS has many benefits, such as recognizing emotions in art and creating virtual expressive faces, but none of these can be applied to the classroom.

FE9AB60822CA,"Having a computer that can tell what you are feeling can and can't be a good thing. Like you could be sad or depressed and not want anyone to know but they computer does. It can send information to people and you didn't want those people knowing how you are feeling. This can cause problems in a family because it may tell them something they didn't want to know.

First off some people would rather keep to themselves because sometimes showing their real self can hurt others. You can always fake being happy or fake being interested in something that you aren't, but the computer can figure out how you are really feeling and let people know that you aren't interested in the thing they are talking about or happy that someone is talking to you. It can ruin everything between people. The article states that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show carying degrees of expression"" (Paragraph 4). This is saying that sometimes people don't put much effort into emotions like for instance smiling, sometimes people don't smile as broadly as they would like to.

This is my opinion on being able to have a computer analyze how you are feeling. I think it would be a bad idea and it would be better off to let people keep their feelings to themselves. Computers being able to tell your feelings is a bad idea and shouldn't come to life.

I believe that it could be useful in student studies. However as we do not yet have fully automated school lessons, the Facial Action Coding System would be unused in most cases.

The information from this new coming technology is used to impersonate a human counterpart, therefore the information would be already in use by the human teacher already in a classroom. The computer does what teachers all over already do everyday and every class period. The expressions from students is already being used by the teacher to change lessons when they become noneffective. With teachers already doing that the information becomes useless for the teacher already has the skills to do so themselves.

The artical states that, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" If Huang, creator of the computer program, could creat a more home friendly version of the softwear it could improve the uses of such technology. For students who use an online school, this information could be much more useful. Online schools do not have the face to face connection that brick and mortar schools do, therefore the computer lessons could use the facial expressions to drasticly improve their lesson plans. They could scan the face of the student and see to what type of lessons the student responds better to and use that type of teaching more often.

In conclusion, in my opinion, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is of limited value. With the use of human teachers the information given from the Facial Action Coding System is redundent. The softwear has many uses in marketing and online schooling, but the technology is of little value when the teacher is capable of reading the same emotions and putting them to the same use.

The Facial Acting Coding System would allow a student who was confused or bored to get extra help. As is stated in paragraph 6 of they are confused or bored it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor to help them understand. This would allow someone who was quiet and shy that is to afraid to ask for the extra help in class to get the help. They would be able to do so without speaking up in front of everyone and geting embarassed, they could just simply sit there and pay attention allowing the Facial acting coding system to see it.

The Facial Action Coding System would also allow someone who is very upset to get help without having to be straightforward and walk up to someone and ask. It could recognize you are upset as stated in paragraph 3 and it could alert someone that you nee help. You could then have them come to you instead of you having to start the conversation with them and theyd already know you were upset and needed to talk to someone.

It would also be able to find what you are interested in and help you find stuff you like and possibly what you want to do. As stated in paragraph 6 the computer can play an ad and it can see if you like it by the response you have suchas smiling it will play more ads that are like that one or if you frown it can avoid ones like that and play something the complete opposite until it finds what you like. This would also allow you to find people who are similar to you that like the same stuff allowing you to become friends and get closer tothe friends you already had.

Instead of buying Facial Action coding System they should buy school material,books or even online websites for kids to learn,because kids really wouldn't like a computer checking them out if they are happy or sad.

Students wouldnt like to go to school knowing that almost everyday that there going to check their emotions. Everyday there are people that go to school sad,depressed,happy, and exited and those people dont wat to tell other people how they feel like. Even if those people try to fake smile theey wouldn't get away without it because in the article it say's ""In a false smile,the mouth is streched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. So this means that it can detect a fake smile because of our face muscle called orbicularis pars palpabraeus.

Even though it's kinda a cool invention but it shouldn't be for students or schools because sometime students want to fix here emotion by themselve or sometimes they don't want anyone to see that person emotion.

One reason why it would be good is to see if the person is just not happy at all then you could talk to them and see whats going on with them. So you can see if you can fix it. Another reason why i think its a good thing is because it tell the peron your doing it to and you how there expressions are. I also fill like this could be a good thing because if the person is going threw a hard point in their life then this would be good. The reson why this could be good is because then you could help them out before they do anything to them self. another thing that this would be good for is if you r going to go do something and the other person has a expression on there face you cant tell how they feel about it then yoiu can use this technology to see if it bothers them or not.

Having technology that can tell if a student is confused or board would have value becasue it could help teachers know which of their students are understand what they are teaching and which ones aren't.

I think that this new technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because people can tell how you are actually feeling. In the article, the author states that ""there are six basic motions-hapiness, surprise, anger, disguest, fear, and sadness. I believe this is true because those are the basic emotions that people show. If we use this technology, then other students will know how their friends and teachers are feeling. It could also help students know if another student is upset about something that they said. Having technology that can tell how someone is actually feeling would have value because it could help students know how their friends and teachers are feeling.

I really believe that this new technology would have value because teachers could know if a student is confused or bored over what they are teaching and it could help people know how you are actually feeling. This could help teachers know who needs help with what they are learning in class. It could also help students know how you are actually feeling.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

192587AF5D13,"This idea i think is very usefull for teachers now, its bad enough we cant understand a persons mood. It is bad because someone could be sad or angry but the person wont say anything to get it out of his or her system. If we had this system it would be great to know wether a student is okay, fine or depressed. The fact that we already know six characterisitc movements means that we can probably find more. The six basic emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness.

The bad things about the emotion detecting system is that it could mess up some how and it would tell the teacher that this kid is sad but he is happy. The machine could be really expensive and schools wouldnt even be interested in buying these systems. The system could probably pick up other emotions that are not propriate and the kid would feel embarrased. Why would a teacher really want this system anyways.

Overall i think this machine is beneficial to schools everywhere in the United States. The system sounds like it will be because of how much knowlege u know from a student because of there emotional look. This can be great for the student also, to let him know that that the section he just read was boring or fun. I think this emotion system will be great for every school in the future.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
DA61A6F47A15,"I don't agree with using this technology to read students emotional expression. I think it wouldnt be a machines business to know how your feeling because some people like muself sometimes dont want to know how you really feel. For example. if I was feeling down one day about my dog passing away, and my little sisters want me to take them to the park. Im gonna stay as positive and happy as possible so it doesnt ruin their day. I would take them to the park making it seem like im happy, then eventually be happy myself after the fun we have. I wouldnt want some machine telling me or other people my emotions because thats my business.

Our emotions belong to us only and we choose for people or other things to know how we feel when we want to.

I am not the only one who sometimes hides the way they feel for a bit. We all know if you try to stay positive and have a good day that you will get over no matter what the situation is bringing you down. If you stay positive and happy, then it will all go away eventually instead of expressing how you feel and staying depressed or crying all day.

It seems like this technology can be useful or pretty cool to use on histroical people. Like who wouldnt want to know how Abe Lincon felt when he took his picture to be on the dollar bill. That would interest me by alot. Only because that is history and its very intersting, but using it everyday of your life can be really annoying and show less privacy. It is a good way to cheer people up like if a friend was feeling down and didnt want to tell you how he or she felt at the moment. That is understandable, but like i explained all you have to do is asume that they are feeling down and cheer them up the best you can and carry on with the day. Eventually they will be back to they're old self again.

Knowing how someone feels right off the top can be annoying for some people like myself. It can cause others like myself to feel very uncomfortable and not wanting to express how they feel because some machine does it for you. Maybe some people want to express how he or she felt a few days after they felt down or depressed. I highly disagree with thus technology being used in our everyday lives to see how we feel, although it would be very nice and interesting to use this technolgy on histroical pictures like the famous Mona Lisa or how President Abe Lincon felt on the dollar bill photo.

4FFC4DB08B42,"I claim this technology because when it scans somebody face it can tell us the percentage of out facial expressions. For an example Mona Lisa demonstrates that is really surprising to bring a simlie to your face while the computer shows you based on much percentage of happiness you have right now. Another example is that the facial technology had a lot of different movements that can track your facial face movements. Because it all about the muscles in your facial face. They even indicate the difference between a genuine simlie and a force one. You can imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad or angry or even fear. For example, if you simlie when a web ad is on your screen a very similar ad will pop up again. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. Based on how you act.

Having this new technology would be a better fit with the people because when is feeling down and the other person don't know on how they feel they always use the facial technology to show the percentages of how down they really are. But for some people they don't need that because we can tell others people facial expressions by just looking at them clearly, which it true.

168502152B51,"The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuble because teachers and other students can tell how a student may feel. It is important to know how someone is feeling so they can get counciling if needed, or so they can cheer up others. It's also important to be able to recognize facial expressions and the different types of muscle movements. This new type of technology can also be used to improve school systems. The Facial Action Coding System is of value to use on reading students' emotions.

The Facial Action Coding System can regonize how a student may be feeling. This could be beneficial for teachers and councilors because then they could help the student with any emotional problems they may be having. The technology, ""can even identify mixed emotions"". Mixed emotions can show a mix of happiness and sadness at the same time because people's emotions aren't always clear, and people can appear as something they are not. Facial expressions for each and every emotion are diverse.

Recognizing facial expressions and different muscle movements can help determine how someone is feeling. Instead of, ""we humans perform(ing) this same impressive ""calculation"""", we humans can use a more reliable source. The Facial Action Coding System can, ""handle the complex algorithms used to decode"". It can, ""indicate the difference between a geniune smile and a forced one."" Having this in a classroom can tell what students are actually feeling, and we humans wouldn't have to be forced to guess.

This type of technology can improve how schools work. If, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", then a teacher or staff member can better help that student or excite the class. Or, ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". The learning process can be made more entertaining and enriching to students.

Having technology to read students' emotional expressions in school is vauble. It can determine if a student has mixed emotions and needs a councilor, it can calculate how a student honestly feels, and it can improve school systems by giving more attention to those who are troubled or bored. This technological system can be beneficial and vauble. ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

The facial coding system might help know if the students are being bullied to see that they are afraid to go into the classroom and help the student stop the bully from hurting him. this technology could also help to see if there will be any trouble makers if they have a smirk on thier face and see that they will do soming bad.

When you are in school do you ever feel bored? We all do sometimes that is just how things work. Now do you think that if our computers could tell if we were bored that it would make the lesson any more exciting. The lessons that we are taugh are mostly given to the teachers or the teachers make it. If our computers think that we are bored of the lesson it wants to change that. How does that happen? The teahcer would have to make more than one lesson to teach the class. There are also things that are just completely boring at school there can not be a way to make them any better.

Then there is also one or two good things about it like if it were able to detecte if someone were not feeling very good about themselves. They might need help but not come out and say it, this technology could help with that. If you put this in a school you would just get a lot of stressed out faces that have to much homework to do while still trying to have a life. But is this taking things to far is this a violation of peoples personal space. Sometimes people want to keep their emotions to themselves. If this technology is used in schools then there goes all privacy that we have.

This might be a good idea for advancement in technology, but is it the right thing to put in schools? This technology seems pretty cool it could be used in other places but should not be somewhere like a school. This would just be one more thing that makes school not a fun place to be in.

If students used this new idea, it would be helpful for guidance councelors as well for helping students with problems with school/homework or dealing with drama.

This technology can help prevent more teenagers/children committing suicide. This is especially important because everyday teenagers commit suicide due to the fact that they are getting bullied at school, feeling sad, have depression issues, and have suicidal thoughts or actions. The technology can help prevent this because it detects if a person or student is sad, happy, depressed, mad, or having suicidal thoughts. Everyday parents and everyone in this world lose their children/teenagers from suicide. If students all around the United States of America stopped bullying each other we wouldn't have so many teens committing suicide every year.

The technology can also help with elderly people who have short term memory loss or dementcia. It can help the elder person and the nurses or relatives if they are in a nursing home because it helps the nurses see how that elderly person is feeling and how their emotional state is doing on that day. It could possibly help with the elderly with dementcia and their memory and possibly help them regain some memories they once had but forgot.

This emotional state detecting technology can change the way we deal with things. This new idea can help so many teenagers out with problems and adults as well. The technology can be a game changer and a very helpful resource or tool too many people in the United States of America and all over the world.

F6F766C1BDD2,"Do i believe use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuble?

no because a friend can tell when your sad,sometimes the computer can be wrong,and some people look like they are angry but are actually happy.

Technology is not valuabe for studnets expressions in classroms because a friend would know if you are down or happy or depressed the computer can't see tears on the inside they also don't know your life. An example is""a kid who is bi-polar they could be happy the one second,then boom anry the next second"". You mean to tell me a computer can't tell if your'e angry one second then happy another second? Another example could be sometimes you just don't know if that person is sad,happy,angry and sometimes the kid doesn't wangt to talk about his or her emotions"". i believe this can prove that the computer doesn't know if the kid is happy or sad,but the friend will!

The use of technology can't read the emotional expressions of a student in a classroom becaue the computer is not always correct about everything. An example is ""a game like NBA 2k18 they can scan your face,but it doesn't look just like you"". Another big example is ""the computer isn't always the right answer just like the internet the answer doesn't always come out right so the computer won't get your emotional feelings right.""

Another reason the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom isn't valuable because a lid could look angry but is actually happy. an example is ""sometimes i look angry but tkats just my normal face,so the computer would say i'm angry when i'm really happy"". Another examle is ""a kid could have a dissorder on his or her expression so once again the internet is wrong"". this proves that the computer cannot read the emotional expressions of students in class.

As i stated in the text all those examples prove that my eviedence prves that using computers to express whether the use of technology reads the students emotional expressions. they can't because the computer doesn't know if the kid is happy or, mad, a friend can tell when they are mad,and sometimes the internet is wrong.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

The software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. He then relies on his pyschologist Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of Facial Action Coding System. He has classified six basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it tells us how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. ""Why would they want this?""

If they were used, the students may get mad, it could be a bother to the teacher, or it would be costly and takes regular upkeep.

If technology was used in classrooms, it would not be valuable. The students in the classrooms sometimes want to hide how they feel about someone or something, and having a machine track what they feel, could trigger them. A student can sometimes hide their anger about a student or assignment, but if this was applied, it would be obvious. Another reason they wouldn't be valuable is because if it reads the wrong emotion of someone, they person's anger or emotion may rise and become an even larger ordeal. Someone can already tell what is felt just by looking at someone's face for the most part, as the author stated in paragraph 5, so there is no point to have to have a machine do the same thing. A friend would be also able to see if you are faking a smile or hiding what you really feel. The teachers also are another reason they wouldn't hold any value.

A second reason that the machine is not worth it is because of the teachers responses. A teacher may now see how a student feels about something and this could lead to more disiplinary issues. The teacher may feel annoyed if the students become amused and there would not be a point to teaching. In paragraph six, it says, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" and this shows that they are becoming like a teacher and this could lead to a decrease in available jobs, kind of like what is happening with robots. The placement of these machines in classrooms could cause more stress on teachers and more to worry about on top of the student's needs. They aren't only a bad idea because of the teachers and students, but also the upkeep.

The final reason they should not be placed in classrooms is because of the price and upkeep. The machines would not be a cheap purchase and the schools have better items to buy for the school. The school my have to hire more people to make sure they are always working and this is also using more of the schools money. The device would be like any other piece of technology and would also require updates. The ""Da Vinci Code"" would not be totally accurate every time, and that could lead to a disruption. Nick D' Alto says, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" which shows how complicated the machine is and how easily it could misinterpret emotions.

These would be happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These are all also associated with each and every movement of the facial muscles. The new created technology seems to be valuable to the people that use it today and specifically would have a value for students in a classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System uses video imagery to track facial movements with the new emotion-recognition software created in the system. It weighs every unit and can identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared to a face that show no emotion also clled a neutral face. Dr Huang commented in the artile ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" that he believes "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". This could be a great use to teachers in their classrooms so they know what to explain more on and for which student. As a student, I can assure anyone that the worst thing at school in a class is when you can't understand something. When a student is completely confused, they can loose intrest and also motivation to comprhend what's going in in class. Dr Huang also added that ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"".

This new technology comes with many benifits and advatages for all people of different ages. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable for students and teachers at school during the day. It will help kids be more proactive and motivated in class knowing that if they don't undertsnad something that help from this system will always be there. It's intresting to see all the new inventions and ideas that continue to be created as years go by to benefit human life and the rest of the world. This is an idea that people need to take advatage of and use at school. For this system to be able to read the expressions of sudents in class will communicate to teachers that a student is in need of more attention than others. The help of the Facial Action Coding System could possibly change the life a kid in class and help shape him into a successful hard worker of today's society.

3F4A655BBF22,"Teaching in a classroom setting is something that has been happening sucessfully for centuries now, dating way way back before technology was even being thought about. This goes to show technolgoy is not needed, but maybe sonetimes helpful. In a classroom setting peices of technology such has things like computers can be super helpful when doing things such as writing an essay, and acessing information online, however when taken too advancely it can become more of a joke, and a distraction to students. That's where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The Facial Action Coding System theoretically seems to be a good idea but in reality it's an expensive toy. There are many other proven effective ways to teach in a classroom, and somethings are boring to learn about but you still have to know them, so just sit still, relax, and learn.

The first thing you notice when walking into a classroom is usually the students who are choosing not to spend their time wisely rather than the students who are. This is because students who choose be off task are often distracted by technolgy and gaming which is a lot more noticable to the human eye. These students are taking advantage of technology provided and using it for bad. So why would we put the Facial Action Coding System in schools when it is expensive and would be used as a toy? That's right, we wouldnt. When used for other purposes we also risk crashing which is another thing that would take up more time rather than taking that time for the students to be taught.

Everybody learns in differnt ways for example take the idea of studying for a spelling test. Some kids learn by writing it down multiple times, some kids learn by hearing it being spelled, others learn best by repeating it. There are so many way for kids to learn so by adding the Facial Action Coding System into schools you're assessing kids on how much they enjoy what they are learning about, and not how much information they are actually gaining. Which bring me to my next point.

Not every kid is going to be excited about everything they learn. Yes, some books are boring, and who wants to learn about what cells are made of, and who cares who invented the lightbulb, but these are all things kids are going to learn anyways. Not everything is going to be fun. sometimes you just need the facts. Making kids excited about a topic all comes from the influences of other people being excited about a topic and feeling that positive energy around them. If a computer screen told you you were bored, it wouldn't make you less bored.

The Facial Action Coding System is not all bad. There are some good parts about it. In the pasage the author talks about how ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" To recognize when a student is confused is a powerful thing, because when more students are confused they don't always like to say it, however the Facial Action Coding System is an expesive way to tell if a student is confused. If a child is confused they should say something. This allows students to build up self-confidence. All in all the Facial Action Coding System has both pros and cons, however the cons over power the pros making this tool not valuable in a classroom setting. It is an expensive toy that should be used for other purposes. Not to say there is no good uses for the Facial Action Coding System, but it is just not valueable in a classroom setting.

If we where to use this type of technology everyday it would be very unusal for the simple fact that school isnt about using technology to tell someones emotions. I don't think it would be really a good idea though to have that in school. The reasoning behind that is because the students would get to destracted from what they are suppose to be doing. Then it would be a destraction to the teachers to, because everytime something seems wrong with a student they would have to take time and try to scan their face when they are not paying attention. It could also be an amazing idea for trying to tell if a kid is starting to form depression or is always sad. The reasoning behind that is because then people have a better chance at trying to help the person in need. It also wouldn't be that of a good idea because if you sitting at home sombody could be watching you through the camera since it would automatically try to evaluate how you feel. Another down flaw to it would be is how would customers come up with the money to buy such edvance techonolgy. After all said and done by the time they get the computer they would have something better to reconize your emotions with. To be able to have this type of technology in a class room would not be right, for the simple fact when you come to school you come here to learn and get the right education you need in life. that is my reasoning behind the FACS ( Facial Action Coding System) why I would not recomend on having this type of technology in my classroom.

People like to keep there personal thoughts to them selves I don't like the idea of reading peoples mines. We should not do this becaus it might make things easyer at the same time harder. I don't think technology will make things easyer nomader what there will always be trouble.

I don't like this becaus too me it's like spying on somebody.

I think we should only use this for paintings like the Mona Lisa but not on people who are still alive. This would to me make people oncofortable.

Although some may ask, why dont you just ask us how we feel in this class? Others might just nit want to answer the question. So it would be easier to just get your answer from a mechine that gives you the answer you want.

There are many advantages to this technology when it come to reading other emotions. When using this device you could find out if many students are interested in the activity the teacher is talking about. You could also find out if the are just bored to death that they just want to get up and leave.

This technololgy could help with many things in the future by getting rid of all the non-fun things that happen in classroom. If this technology was in high schools I think the way teachers teach thing now days would be way better. For example, when the author put the mini lesson about moving you face in different emothions that was a good lesson. Just from that I learn that just moving your face around in different emotion could make you feel like the face you just made.

When it come to technology about your emotions in the classroom i think it would be very useful. Not only will the teachers know if students are interested, they will know if they need to change the way they teach things in class.    ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) as the protential to help students, and teachers in the classroom. FACS can read the students faces and tell wither they understand the lesson. It will then change the lesson to something that will help the students better understand. The FACS can also detecte when a students is getting bored of a lesson, and will change it to a more pleasing one. It will change to better acommidate the student's needs.

FACS can also help the teachers better understand their own students more. Since the FACS system can read the six basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It will help the teacher know what their students are feeling. Teachers will know more about their students, and will be able to form a closer bond with them. The FACS system will help the teacher understand what the student need more help with, and what they are more intrrested in.

The FACS system can read the facial muscles, and this is how it can detacte the emotions of people. It can even identify when someone has mixed emotions, and compares each expression with a neutral face. This is how it can regoinze when students are feeling bored, confused, or any other emotion. The inventor of the FACS system, Dr. Paul Eckman, is the one to classify the six basic emotions. He also was the one that asscociated each with characteristic movemetns of the facial muscles. Like when your frontalis pars lateralis raises your eyebrows when you are suprised, and you orbicularis oris tightens your lips when your angry. All this can help the system tell when the students in the classroom need a change in the lesson.

BC8A28D95F08,"The new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable. This new technology will be very useful in a classroom full of students that one teacher may not be able to handle all on their own. The Facial Action Coding System will help deal with many problems by reading a students face. This may help deal with situations a teacher can not figure out on their own. This software may be able to tell the teacher when the student is confused, upset, or even when the student is bored and needs a more interactive subject or way of learning.

When a student is confused, they may not ask for help to a teacher. The child may be too shy or nervous to ask for a simple example or explanation. This software program will be helpful because it will be able to read the students confused face and tell a teacher that the student needs help. In the short story in paragraph six it states, ""most communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This explains how not all people will use words to explain what they are feeling. These students may never speak up for themselves or have the courage to ask a question without the program being here to help deal with the childs needs.

The Facial Action Coding System will not only help with students life in the classroom, but it may also help with a students feelings deeper within. The software will be able to pick out the students who are very upset, and need to talk about their emotions to another person. If a student has a sad face in class, the program may be able to identify what is wrong with the child, and it could notify this information to a teacher or a well trusted adult. In paragraph five of this story it states, ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" By having this computer software, it could help out with a students mental emotional feelings as well.

This program will also be very helpful in providing a fun learning environment for the students. In the middle of paragraph six it explains how a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored. It also states that if you smile when a website advertisement pops up on the computer screen it will show more advertisements like that one. If a person frowns when this pops up, it willl show a different, more appealing advertisement. This can be very useful in a classroom. It may make the students more interested in learning. The students might even be more excited to learn now, because the computer will know that the students happy facial experssions mean they are enjoying the type of way the program is teaching them.

The new Facial Action Coding System will be extremeley helpful in a classroom. The students will have a more positive learning environment with this software. The new technology will not only be able to help with a students mental emotions, but it will help them be in a happier state of learning.

C0E0C38AB604,"In my opinion the Facial Action Coding System technology is a great valuable and reliable application for students to get into, I say this because not only does it sound smart, but Dr. Huang gives much details about the invention and explains how the model works when recognizing emotions. Dr. Huang sticks to his topic of the Facial Action Coding System, he has predictions about it as well by saying that ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor, also gets into human and emotional communication. The 6 types of basic emotions are also discussed in this article and they're happiness, suprise, anger, disgust fear, and sadness. Although many are associated with facial movements which are the types of feelings and the type of reaction someone gives when feeling these types of ways.

Dr. Huang gives more brief discriptions of this technology by explaining how humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" every day then after supporting his claim he gives examples to inform humans about the technology. Dr. Huang wants to make sure he is doing his best on explaining the theory of emotions and the information explained is a perfect example to set to intrest and to make sure these are valuable. These are the many reasons why I am for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional claims.

These theory of emotions could work for some students and not work for others, I say this beacuse there are different types of people in the world with different types of situations in life. Although Dr. Huang technology sounds great it might not be the best option for every student, but he still makes a great administrator and a great leader to me in my opinion.

6AD39619EC45,"The use of Facial Action Coding Systems could be very useful. There are several reasons for this. First of all there are several industries ot can be used in. Secondly it could help students get a better education. The last reason is that it could make advertisements more relevant. However there are also drawbacks to using a computer software to read people's emotions.

Several industries would benefit from this software. As the article mentions artists are required to be able to recognize the facial expressions of the people they are painting or drawing. These expressions are critical to conveying the correct emotions, so clearly the art industry could benefit from the use of Facial Action Coding Systems. Another way industy that this software could be used in is politics. The article talks about how the software can recognize the difference between a fake smile and a real smile. This could be useful when analyzing political figures as well as celebrities. A possible downside to this is cost effectiveness. The question of is the cost really worth it whenever there are already people in the world that can do the same thing.

Another useful aspect of the Facial Action Coding System is it's use in schools. In the article Dr. Huang, the co-developer of the system, says that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, likean effective human instructor."" This could be the most useful aspect of the software, because not everyone learns in the same way. If your computer could recognize when you were getting bored or confused and then fix the problem it would make learning much easier for a lot of people. It would also allow students to move at their own pace as not everyone works at the same speed. A downside to this software is the loss of jobs for teachers as well as the reliance on technology.

The last aspect is that it could make advertisements more relevant. The article states that if you smile when an internet ad appears on your screen, another similar as might follow. However if you frown, the next ad will be different. This is useful both for the consumer and the company. We all know that when an annoying ad pops up it usually gets ignored especially if we've already seen that ad one hundred times. But what if the ad was for something you actually liked then you might go buy it. The only negative about this is that the software won't recognize if you're smiling about the video you just watched or the ad that pops up.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System could possibly be very useful in the future. There are many industries where it could be used, schools could use it to make education more beneficial and it could make advertisements more relevant. However there are also a few issues which should be adressed before it could be used in mainstream businesses and schools. ",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

If that technology read their mind and the world knows it they will suffer more and never get over it. Also, there are many good reasons to agree it and there are many reasons that I disagree. The technology might ruin every person's life.

In addition, I disagree with this technology because in the text, third paragraph says in order to read the expressions your face bone has to be different, but there are a lot of emotions that people don't show, you might be happy or sad and your face still the same. I don't think that tecnology can comprehend people's emotion and people's mind. Basically, the third paragraph says that emotion are base on your bones but I notice when I am sad, happy, disgust or mind blank my face is the same: a face that's blank minded. Most people can't read my mind and I don't think the technology can either.

Another reason that I don't agree with technology reads mind is because there are people who don't want people to know what's in them. For example, if there's a girl is unhappy and in order to make her friends to be happy she do everything and maybe no one will notice and her friends will be glad for her. If the technology reads her minds and let her knows about it, their friendship might be in chaos and ends.

Also, why I am disagree with it because I remeber one time my teacher told me that science is not always 100%. I don't think this technology is accurate because I notice when one of my friend is sad I can tell by the way she talks but not her expressions. In the text says that not only your facial muscles knows your emotion but also produce them, but what if your bone is twisted and have an unhappy seems face but you are actually happy. The article says that facial muscles produce emotion, I disagree with it because when I feel sad or blank most of the time my facial bones still the same.

In conclusion, this technology shouldn't invented because it might not be accurate and says false about people expresson. This technology can only read expression only by bone but not voice or heart so I don't think it's accurate. That's why we shouldn't use this technology because science is not always 100% correct. We should get to know the person's mind better instead of use technology to know theirs.

If a student asked to go to the nures and said they were sick the nurse would be about to tell if they were with the computer software. So know there would be less people getting sent home. Since students would only get sent home if they really were sick then they would do better in school becasue they would be there more.

Computer can recognize the subtle facial movements that human use to express how they feel. When someone make a movement of one or more muscles that is called ""action unit.""

Then, many characters can make a movements of facial muscles. For example, when you are surprise, you have your mouth open and raises your eyebrows. Each expresseion that people makes is compared against a neutral face. Muscular action units indicate the difference between a genuine smile and forced one.

Finally, making a communication with others will also showed your facial expressions. You can tell how your friends is feeling by looking on their faces. Computers can tracks your facial movements and expressions. Computers stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. For example, computer can recognize when you are becoming confused or bored.

In Conclusion, Making a facial movements and expression while communicating with others is important because it will tell the others how you feels. Mona Lisa don't smile often, but the computer can make her face smile by using the imagery. Facial impression and movements are not just for communicating it can also be in while looking at someone or reading a books.   ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
34F995479008,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify and act on human emotions. It reads a person's facial feature and identifies their emotions. For example, if particular person sees an ad they don't like, the computer will read their expression upon it and acts quickly to make them satisfied. This technology can definitly be useful to students.

Everyday in a classroom a student will stop paying attention because they are confused or bored. In the article, it tells how the computer will try another strategy to get the student back on board with the main topic. This could be by making it into a game or maybe showing them a video that will help them understand the subject. This is an amazing technique to make sure no student falls behind.

There are so many ways that parents use to get there children into learning without any complications. Many students take online classes so they can go at their own pace. Most parents try to get their kids home schooled so they feel more comfortable with their surroundings. Some parents even get their younger children who have not been enrolled to school yet, started on the learning proccess. And although some websites might be helpful it does not always work out in the best way. With the new technology the computer, it willl be able to sense what the students pay more attention to, what the students are more interested in learning about. And with that, the computer will be able to find a way to get the students more on board with the learning proccess.

Many students have some big problems in their life and some people won't be able to help them. However, if the computer knows how to make them smile or feel better about themselves this might lead to a decrease in depression and teenage suicide events. With this new technology teenagers may not even have to worry about what is going on in the social media websites. They wiill be doing things that make them happy or satisfied with their life. This will be a major decrease in cyber bullying.

This new technology called the Facial Action Coding System will have a major impact on not just students, but with every teenager who has trouble staying on track in and outside of school. This technology will enable students to be able to learn at their own pace with their style of learning and with some extra help, This will be very valuable to students everywhere.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
06E5ACD7F079,"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" focuses on the complex software that can analyze a face and even read emotions. The author claims this could be very useful in teaching, for being able to acount for the student's emotions could very well help the computer adapt and change the lesson more efficiently. While this could be true, there are a lot of questions that should be asked before this technology can be implemented, such as it's effectiveness and privacy.

The sixth paragraph says how the computer can know if you're happy or sad, and gives an example ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad may follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This seems to be very helpful, but what if said person was smiling about something else? what if the person remembers something funny that happened the other day and suddenly they notice they keep getting uninteresting ads that pop up? There would be no way for the computer to tell if it was really the ad that made the person smile. Another issue is how it is used in class. Paragraph six states ""A classroom computer could recognize if a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" How would the computer tell what degree a pupil is confused? If a student looks a little confused, the computer may read this and respond as if the student was very confused, thus wasting the student's time with more help than they need. One more way to look at it is the privacy violations the software may bring. What if a student is opposed to a teacher being able to technologically and truthfully read the students emotions? does the computer take a log of the faces of the students? There is too many suspicious questions in regard to the morality and safety of the use of such software.

The software definitely shows promise. It seems to show how far we have come to understanding the relation to facial expressions and emotion. That being said, there is still too much to account for before this new technology can be integrated into classrooms, such as efficiency and morality.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
0ACB0E08934E,"The ""Facial Action Coding System"" is technology that can be used in the class room because some people can't figure out how good or bad someone is feeling. Teachers will be able to know if the student is learning or eithor not paying attention or sleeping in class. It'll be easier for them to know what's false and what's true expression in their situation they could be in.

In difference in the situation students can't understand someone's expression. Thanks to the technolgy now it'll be easier to figure out students emotion or anyone. The article states, "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face.""""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.""

Finally, yes the technology is worth a big margin but its worth to have the help we can all get to help us know many. In my opinion it'll be a better way to learn/read better on our emotional expressions because you""'ll have more information and could know more about everything you want or need to know about the expressions. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. We humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day, for instance, you can probably tell how a person is feeling simply by the look on their face.

A5843F6B15B8,"In Nick D'Alto's writing of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" he talks about a computer software, developed by Thomas Huang, that can detect spacific muscle movements in order to identify diffrent emotions. Nick argues that this technology will be revolutionary to many aspects of life, such as education, film and video tech careers, and maybe even politics. I believe that this advancement should not be implamented into a school enviorment for three key reasons, it is an invasion of privacy, it doesn't provide any academic assistance, andI don't respect the idea of robbing next generations the right to interact with an actual human teacher at such a young age. For these three reasons I plan to despute why I disagree with Nick D'Alto about implameting this kind of software into education.

First, I disagree with Nicks idea because its an invation of privacy. Imagen that you were in elementary school again and this tech was installed. You would go through the day with this unconfortable sensation that you are constantly being watched but whats even worse is that your thaughts are also being monetered. imagen your children in this situation. This would then lead on to teaching them that they shoulden't produce thaughts or emotions on there own even if they were negative thaughts.

Second, I disagree because there is no academic assistance that this technolagy would assists students there for it is not nessasary. This tech dosen't provides instructions or academic reasoning it just reads emotions.

Third, I don't agree with D'Alto's claim because I don't respect the idea of robbing next generations the right to interact with an actual human teachers. If we allowed this tech we would deprive human contact from kids at such a young age. Because kids brains are like sponges at such a young age we shove so much information at such a young age that if we take human conntact away they would become socialy deprived of that connection to humans so thats why I believe we should not implament this tech into education.

7CF49F831E85,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it is shown that this high tech software can recognize how you are feeling for example if you smile a scanner will send the data to the computer and the main thing that the computer has to know is the mucles you are using because you could actually be mad,sad,disgust,fear,and surprise all at once so this high tech computer sees if you are using zygomatic major then you are smiling but if the person is frowning then that means that they are sad.

The Mona Lisa one of the most known peice of art from the Renaissance area made by Leonardo Da Vinci's is said to be the only painting at that time that seems to be a woman smiing but that is false. The Mona Lisa was actually showing more then just a smile she was showing three more different emotion besides happyness. The reason that is because when they took a picture of her and put her face in 3D humans face it showed that she was disgusted,fearful,and angry. So this computer can be also useful to see what people from the past felt during those time to see if they had any emotions or did they not. In my conclusion emotion can be easy to find threw high tech software but we as human can see the person emotions to but the only differents is that we see the main picture and not the littlest one's.",1,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
