E1DF5A240860,"I think it should be designed by teachers. The reason why it should be teachers designed, is that if the students need help on the project the teachers would know how to help.

Teachers help students a lot with providing information that they need to complete their assignments. There was this one times my friend Generic_Name needed help on his projects he kept over thinking that he had to much,or that it might not be enough. But when he ask the teacher for assistants Mr Generic_Name help show him the things that he needed,and don't need. Once Mr Generic_Name showed him Generic_Name felt better about his project

Teachers have more knowledge than students. To became a teacher you have to go to college and get your degree. And they have already went through the process,of being a students in school. For and example my Grandmother used to all ways tell me I didn't know more than her because she have been living on these earth more than me and she was right because I haven't. She have been a students before she had to do same things I have to do.

The reason why it shouldn't be a student designed is because most kids now a day just copy and paste anything from google and don't put no thought into hard working

That's why you should pick teachers design they have more knowledge and training.",3,Summer projects,Independent
59B8A753F73F,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These projects range from all sorts of different styles and designs. Some people argue that these assignments should be teacher-designed so it is more detailed and challenging. Others argue that it should be student-designed so its better for the student. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will learn better from it, students will be more passionate about it, and teacher-designed projects take away freedom.

Summer projects should be student-designed because students will learn better from it. People learn better when they do things themselves. If students have the ability to choose how to do their project, then they can learn from their mistakes. Mistakes are the best way to learn which makes student-designed projects the best way to learn. Furthermore, its helps students overcome obstacles. When students are doing their projects they will run into troubles. If the project is student-designed, they will have to overcome these obstacles themselves and help them grow academically. To sum it up, student-designed projects help students learn from mistakes and help them overcome obstacles.

Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be more passionate about it. Students will do their project if they can choose what its on. If students can choose the subject of the project they will be more likely to do it because they are interested in what it is about. If the project is something they do not care about, they will not complete the assignment. Students will have more fun doing the project. If students can choose the subject of the project they will likely choose something they are interested in. If the subject of the project is something the student enjoys, they will have a great time doing it. To sum it up, student-designed projects will encourage students to complete the assignments and students will have a good time doing it.

Summer projects should be student-designed because teacher-designed projects takes away a student's freedom. Teacher's get to choose everything. Teacher's get to choose what assignments students receive throughout the whole school year. Students should get the chance to be free and choose what they want. Furthermore, Students should get the choice of how the project gets done. Students have to take time out of their vacation to complete their summer project. Since they're using their own time, they should at least get to decide how to do their project. To sum it up, student-designed projects give students the freedom to learn what they want to learn.

Student-designed projects are better than teacher-designed projects because they help students learn better by making them overcome obstacles. Students are also more passionate about it and it gives them the freedom to do what they want. Students don't get the chance to choose many things, but summer projects should be something they get to complete the way they want.",4,Summer projects,Independent
C54DFE18A444,"Summer projects keep the mind sharp. However often tedious, summer projects can often be beneficial as it can prepare the students for the following year or preferebly life. Some believe that these projects should be teacher designed so that students have the base kowledge on what will be covered that year, however that's not what learning is about. Learning is a life long journey not a journey to the next test. If these summer projects were student designed, where students had the freedom to choose, they could work on a something they truly found interesting. These projects could give them life experience rather than school experience.

Firstly, these summer projects can be anything from work experiece to writing a noval. For example if a student loved to write and thought they may have a carreer as a jounalist or even an author they may decide their time was best spent on sharpening those skills. Not only would their time be spent to make themselves a better writer but also they would excited to do the work. However what if a student decides to make their project a job or even an internship at some law firm, well that is even better. These students will come back to school with more maturity, life experience and perhaps some money in the bank.

Another outcome of student designed summer projects is rather than coming back the school with dred and resentment, they'll come back excited to showcase what they've learned. For example if teachers assigned a massive work load on everything they might need to pass the tests during the year, students will be anxious, unmotivated and stressed by the first day of school. This would kill students desire to learn and cause resentment towards teachers. However, if students can come back to school with the confidence that they are able to learn and experiece things by themselves, students will come into school postive and inspired to learn rather than being negative and unmotivated.

Finally, there is a difference between schooling and learning. Schooling is a soley a tool to educate individuals however it is temporary. Learning is rather a life long jouney, something that should never stop. There is learning before school such as when you learned to walk and talk for the first time and then there is learning after school when you get a job or simply when you read a book. That is why summer projects should be the students responsibility, so that they can learn to learn by themselves. Sadly too many students believe that learning and schooling are the same thing and their life long jouney ends once they leave school.

In conclusion, summer projects should be the students responsibility. These summer projects should inspire students to learn and experience new things. The goal is to have students motivated when they return to school rather than stressed and anxious for the year to end. Lastly learning is a life long jouney, schooling is temporary.",5,Summer projects,Independent
48A79347EF59,"Summer assignments are never fun and many students can agree with that statement. Even though they are beneficial to continue your learning throughout your break. Summer assignments should be designed by the teachers of the course due to the fact that they are familiar with the curriculum, they understand what is needed to be tested on throughout the course, and the teacher knows what the students are capable of doing.

Teachers are familiar with the curriculum and know what needs to be on your assignment to ensure that you are successful in the class. The teachers have learned that topic and are experts on the subject. Going to a college and receiving a higher education in a certain topic makes the professor best fit to decide what you should learn during your break off from school. For example in a AP Human Geography class the summer assignment was to fill in maps of the world and fill out chapter guides for the first two units. In doing this the students became familiar with the content which makes them more likely to receive a higher grade and a better understanding of the unit. This proves that when the teacher designs the assignment they are leading you to become more familiar and successful in your learning.

Teachers know what is being tested in a course and what is expected for the student to know. Teachers have to teach certain things to the students while following a guideline. This tells the teacher what the student should know by the end of the year. By giving the students a summer assignment that lets them be ahead and know certain topic then it benefits the students and makes them receive a better understanding of the curriculum. In most courses there are online resources that allow the teacher to know what should be taught by the end of the year and what should be taught in a certain state. This helps the teacher decide what the summer assignments should be. Some students may think that a student-designed assignment would be easier and more beneficial. This is incorrect due to the fact that the students aren't familiar with the subject or what needs to be taught. The students also aren't responsible enough to decide what needs to be learned over their break.

Teacher understand the students position since they were all in the same place at a certain point in time, therefore they will assign what they know the student is capable of doing without overwhelming them. The teacher will give the student a doable amount of work that will benefit them without stressing and overwhelming them. A teacher that taught AP Human Geo at a high school understood that students wanted a break from school and they didn't want to do useless work that wouldn't help them. Therefore he gave them a good amount of work that they could finish and learn from.

Summer assignments should be teacher-designed due to the fact that teachers understand the students and understand the curriculum so they can balance an assignment that benefits the students. Teachers are more familiar with the subject and know what the students will be tested on, therefore the assignments will have a good purpose. Teachers should make the assignments because they are experts on the topics and have the students interests at heart so they can help them.",5,Summer projects,Independent
63382FEE34A7,"Summer projects are something a student always dreads during vacation, maybe your at the pool and you remember that you have to do a research paper for your science class that has to be turned in on the first day of school. So you get ready to work on it but you dont know what to do it on and you get stuck since your supposed to choose the topic and the format your research paper is going to be in. Giving students the opportunity to design there own project is good, but students forget so much during vacations that they have no prior knowldedge or forget how to do certain things. This is why Teacher designed projects during the summer are a better idea then student designed projects. Since students can understandably be too busy enjoying there vacation they can forget how to do certain things or have problems making decisions for there projects. on the other hand if teachers design these projects they can make a rubric on what to include points, topics, and even examples and if any students are confused they can just email the teacher. Ive had experience with a teacher designed project or assignment and it turned out way easier then I thought it would be even when I had difficulties me and my teacher were able to work out a solution so I could finish the project.

Summer vacation for students is a time to relax go travel or visit other family members maybe get ready for a summer sport. Most students wont even think about there work until the last month of vacation when this happens thats when students start to panic. Projects can also be hard if a student goes out of country for the summer and doesnt have acess to technology at all times and struggle to create a project that gets high points. Even if students have acess to technology, during large gaps like summer vacation students can tend to forget many things they learned during the school year since they arent really learning anything. Students are more likely to get a better grade on there projects if they are given certain tasks that they have to do to complete there project so that they dont stress out over the work they have to do.

In comparison Teacher designed projects can be easier to follow since most teachers will leave specific directions that you have to accomplish. This takes away from the stress of coming up with something yourself and sometimes wasting time looking for the right topics. Teacher projects can vary depending on classes like for instance an English might make you read a book then give a report on it and they give you a series of books that you can choose from. Most Teacher projects have a goal or something they want you to accomplish ,so its really clear what they want you to do and how to execute it to get the best grade possible. Reaffirming my statement most teachers will give a rubric or packet to show what you have to do and maybe even examples so you can have a better idea of what they want from you. This method can give students a clear picture of what they need to do and they can plan what work they should complete now and which to do later. Even then students might still be confused so if they really are stuck they can just email the teacher since most teachers will give there email before summer break begins just in case students have questions.

I had a experience with my AP government teacher where before the class had even started he had left us a assignment/project to do. He explained that this project was so we could start the year sprinting and fly through the first couple of units so we could get to the important topics about government. I went travelling to visit my family in Canada and didnt start doing the project until there was a month left. everything seemed pretty easy by itself and everything was clear, but I was supposed to print the the documents after I had finished completing them and I didnt have a printer. I was able to email him to see what I could do and he recomended I just answer the documents in paper and to just hand it to him when school started. i was able to have a nice summer and still do the work and when school came by i was able to give him the work.

Even though teacher designed projects are a bit easier and straight to the point it doesnt give you much option to be creative or do much else. Student projects can be more fun and give a greater sense of purpose since your choosing what your going to do for your project. This gives room to people who are really passionate and creative about theyre topic and they create amazing things. by putting restrictions and limiting the ammount that these people can do it makes them feel less motivated and makes it seem like they are just doing simple work instead of doing something special. this can hurt them and maybe even make them lose interest in the class that they generally like.

In conclusion even though Student projects offer more purpose Teacher designed projects are more simpler and easier to understand so students dont have to stress when they are in vacation. Teachers provide clear directions and can offer help when needed so students can focus on being with there familys and relax. Students can have a rough time doing there projects if they are given vague instructions for doing it and they end up wasting time and not making a good final product. From my experience i was able to complete my work and work through troubles I had with my teacher so I do believe that Summer projects should be Teacher designed. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
95B8CF43E670,"Summer projects have become a cultural norm within the school system. These projects have been created and mandated by the teachers. It can be vigorous and also very flexible depending on the teachers idea of what they believe you should do. Summer projects should be student designed because it allows kids to have more freedom, it keeps the students interested in their project, and allows for more flexibility within their project.

Summer projects should be student designed because it allows kids to have more freedom. Generic_Name, a student at Generic_School, completes vigorous sports and extra curricular activities during summer and, also has 5 different classes with summer assignments. Generic_Name has designed a workload that he can complete while leaving free time but, his teachers have designed summer projects that completely wipe out all his free time. Generic_Name should be able to design a summer project that works for his schedule and, should not be told by his teachers what to do on his only long term break from those teachers. Another student, named Generic_Name, wishes to be engaged during her time off but does not want the burden of having her summer break destroyed by teachers who try to maximize their workload during the time off. She wants to be able to create a project that minimizes her time learning but that keeps her engaged during the break so that she is ready to come back. By mandating what students do outside of school limits their freedom during a time where they should be on a break from school; This totally destroys the whole idea of summer being a break and a time to de-stress by constantly stressing students to finish summer projects. Students want freedom during the summer, this is why projects should be student designed.

Also, summer projects should be student designed because it keeps the students interested in their project. A 12th grade student, named Generic_Name, is being told by his teacher that he must read the book, the odyssey, during his summer break but, Generic_Name has no interest in that book what so ever. Students should have the ability to chose which book they read, if any. If a teacher tells a student they must read a novel over summer, they can choose a book that interests them so it makes it easier and, ultimately more fun for the student. A 9th grader, named Generic_Name is required to complete an 100 question math summer packet during her time off. She has AD/HD and struggles to stay focused for long periods of time, especially in things that do not interest her. By allowing her to complete online practice using a math app, it will keep her engaged and will allow her to make sure she is doing these problems correctly. Teachers mandating what students do and how they do it may interest the teacher but, a majority of the time, will bore the student and can actually lead to a regression in their skills. If students can design their own summer project that keeps them interested, it ultimately leads to more participation and effectiveness among students.

Furthermore, Summer projects should be student designed because it allows for more flexibility within their project. For example, Generic_Name, a student athlete, plays on one of the highest ranked women's lacrosse teams in the country, she has practice and workouts during the weekdays and a tournament every single weekend. Generic_Name was assigned a 400 page book to read but can never find the time nor the energy to read that much. By allowing her to chose, for example, an 150 page book, she can find enough time and energy to stay focused, and be able to complete the book. If students are not allowed the ability to design their projects it tends to become more of a pain to the student, rather than help. It tends to stress students more, especially those with vigorous schedules, during a time created for students to take a break. An 11th grade Spanish teacher, Generic_Name, sends out a summer assignment that requires students to go out and use Spanish in the real world. What would be considered to most students as an easy task, some students are not comfortable with this and would rather do book work at home where they feel more comfortable. A one size fits all plan does not work for every student, some need hands on learning, some need to listen to instruction and be taught directly to, and some students need to read and do book work. The idea that one assignment will fit every students needs and allow them to complete it quickly and efficiently will quite frankly never work. This type of flexibility is what students need out of summer projects and, they should be designed by the students.

Summer projects should be student designed because it allows kids to have more freedom, it keeps the students interested in their project, and allows for more flexibility within their project. Every student is a different learner with different advantages and disadvantages and, projects should be made to meet those students needs or they will either not complete it, or complete it while gaining nothing from it. Students know what they need and should not be completely controlled by teachers who think they know whats best for them. The student knows themselves better than anyone else in the world so they should be able to design their own summer projects.     ",6,Summer projects,Independent
4A55B9B42D20,"Many teachers assign summer projects to students to ensure that the child is still school focused throughout all the fun summer activities. Even though, majority of students hate the words ""summer and project"" together, giving them lead way to design their project is the best way to go. Students would have a chance to gain responsibility, be creative and make an easy grade.

Firstly, giving students the lead way to design their project allows the individual to gain responsibility. The student would be obligated to make time for all the steps leading up to the final project, making them move their schedule around or cancel plans. This ties into being an adult, making sacrifices to get important things done. For example, a students gets a summer project, its a Friday night and his or her friends wants them to go out. Instead of being behind on the project from going out, simply saying no and staying in to miss out on the fun is a sacrifice to the student. Therefore, creating responsibility from the ultimatum.

Secondly, letting students take lead way is the best option because it allows the student to actually be creative. Students get boring topics and assignments all the time, causing them to do poorly strictly because they dont find interest on the topic. However, giving students the free will design the project based on their interests while also being school related will definitely give a change in the result of the final project versus a random teacher designed project. For example, a teacher gives a random topic she designed to the student. The student gets a topic about plants, which the student knows nothing about while also having little to none interest about them. As a result, the student is not going to give their full potential on the project because they did not have interest on the forced topic.

Lastly, letting students design their summer project will give students the ability to bring their grade up. By students being creative and going the extra mile to have a successful project will give them the the perfect opportunity to make a great grade. For example, while doing the summer project the students will have confidence in the topic. While doing research the student will know exactly what they want to look for and even have a small plan on how they'd like the final outcome of the project to be. Resulting in a confident, well put together project.

However, some teachers might argue that allowing the students to design their summer project wouldn't be an excellent idea. Teachers may say that students would give no effort because they do have lead way on their project or it may be overwhelming for the student to make a decision on what they wanted their topic to be. However, letting the student have the option to choose their topic would not allow the student to not give effort or any creativeness. The topic would only be designed by the student and what their personal skill level is, leaving them to set their own boundaries up based on what they prefer.

In result, when summer rolls around and summer projects are assigned, letting students get the opportunity to design their project gives them responsibility by making simple or grand decisions, an open door to the students creative limits, and also makes great pay off from all the hard work and dedication gone into the project. So next time a teacher assigns a boring topic, students should take the lead and make a astonishing grade.",4,Summer projects,Independent
965C95685E5C,"Throughout my adolescent past, I've had a vigorous number of summer assignments. Whether it was a Algebra 1 packet or a summer reading assignment, teachers never fail to overwhelm there students with work before the year even begins. Most summer assignments are enforced by the teachers and lack any student input. A majority of students show little interest in the assignments they are presented and approach the work with a negative attitude rather than optimism. Although a student-designed summer project is a chance for students to exhibit there work in a more enjoyable fashion, a teacher-designed project would work better because teachers understand what work will best prepare students and shows the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.

A reason why teachers should design the projects is because they understand what work will best prepare students. Many teachers have attained an advanced education in there subject. Unlike the students, the teacher knows exactly what the course will consist of, and the level of difficulty that they will cover. In most classes, students start the year with no prior knowledge of the subject they will cover. An example of there unpreparedness is that large portions of high school students switch out of classes because they don't know the level of the work that they will be covering. A student led project could be void of any important information. If they find an area of the subject thats more difficult than the others, they could address that area more than another part of the subject. Assignments created by teachers would be a prime opportunity for teachers to demonstrate the work they will cover, and help a student drop the class if the work seems too challenging. A summer assignment is before the year starts, so switching your classes wouldn't interrupt your school year.

Another reason teachers should design the projects is because it shows what type of assignments will follow in the future. Teachers are a people of habit. Throughout the year, they will assign projects that are very similar to each other, following similar guidelines. An example of repetition in school is teachers assigning a variation of slide show presentations. Throughout the school year, many teachers conduct slide show presentations within new concepts. If a student were to design the summer project, it could be an entirely different format then any format suggested by a teacher. With the teacher in control, they could give you a project very similar to one that you may face in the future.

Many believe that if enjoy what your doing, than you will be more productive. A student getting to choose what type of project they will do could introduce the topic in more exciting manner. While enjoying what you do is important, it may also not prepare a student to the best of it's capabilities. A student led project may not cover the ground that it needs to cover. For example, the students could decide to write a one paragraph reflection on an area of the subject that they found interesting. The problem with that format is that it may only tackle a small portion of the subject, and you wouldn't be able to reflect on what others found interesting, which would help you remember the information better.

The teachers should design the project that the students work on. They know what work will best to prepare students and help them succeed. Teachers understand the subject far greater than any student designing the project. A more rigorous area of the subject could be addressed more in the project. If the teacher creates all of the future projects, than the summer project could reflect the type of projects teachers will assign in the future. Repetition is prominent within classrooms, and a summer assignment created by the teacher could offer incite into future projects. With a student in control of the project, they may only address a small area of the subject that will come up later in the year. While a student-designed summer project can make there work more enjoyable, a teacher-designed project would be better for students, because teachers understand what will prepare them best and is a way to discover the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.     ",5,Summer projects,Independent
AF9079B5EF21,"some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure that kids are still learning over the summer. Leaving only one question should the projects be designed by teachers or the students. Now letting a teacher design a project over the summer rather than the student will only be like homework. Therefore you shouldnt let the teachers design it because if you have homework over the summer just like over the year nine times out of ten your not going to do it. But that does not change the fact that if a student was to design his project he or she would most likely get it done better and get it done more quicker if their designing it themselves. Then again some students may have trouble designing projects themselves. Therefore I do think teachers should design a version of the project for students that that really have the creativity or thought process to get done all on there own.

Just imagine a student at home over the summer time he or she just getting out of school, going on break for two and a half months. think about what a student is going to go threw if a teacher designs a project and assign it to them. It will be way easier for the students to design there project the way they want it to be. For one there doing it over break which means the quicker he or she gets the out the way and done the better. So letting students design their own projects would better for the staff, students, and school. Making a student do teachers work over a break like the summer just isnt going to work because, if a student doesnt get the concept of the project that the teacher assigned then how is he other than looking it up on the internet which does not answer all question. Allowing students to actually get creative and design it them selves can actually help there knowledge in school and the real world. Then to go on and start the next year with good grades rather coming into a class room with an excuse because you where confused on what the teacher said.

working on a project while on summer break may be hard if you got to think of it all by yourself. But not only will you have to think for your self you will have to think about how the teacher actually want this project done. I know that you'll have to worry about how the teachers want it done anyways but in this case the student will have the advantage of designing the project themselves rather than having the teacher design cause any confusion. Because confusions lead to stress and stress results end with you not doing your project. which in that case you can say that it could really happen both ways but the point is that designing a project over summer break where its the student and only the student even tho sometimes he or she may have help from family members that still doesnt assure they will still get there education if their looking at something a teacher designed then letting them design it themselves. Its the students summer theey should atleast be able to design it themselves and not the teachers.

In conclusion students that go to schools where they have projects over                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ",4,Summer projects,Independent
D3E723651DF3,"While on summer break, students typically do not enjoy being assigned school work. There is an ongoing debate over whether or not students should be able to design summer projects. Those who oppose this state that teachers should design student's projects, but this is not true. Although some may disagree students should be allowed to design summer break projects.

There are a variety of reasons why students should design summer break projects. If students where allowed to design projects, one would be able to find an enjoyable topic to focus on. For example, instead of a book review, one could write about a destination they are visiting over the summer. This allows students to enjoy their summer break while still completing school assignments. The summer time is a time for rest; however, students still need to complete assigned projects. If students could design their own projects, one would feel more free and content; as a result, Leaving them with less stress and anxiety. Many students summers are very busy. In between summer camps and plane rides students may find it hard to locate time to complete such work. By designing there own projects, these students can work around their schedule to make the most efficient plan.

There are even more reasons why students should be allowed to design summer projects. During summer students do not want to focus on school. If one is allowed to personalize their own assignment, they will be able to focus more on the task at hand; as a result, the product will come out much better. By using relevant topics that the student is interested in, one can find more information on it than a premade prompt by teachers. Even though school work is typically not fun, students can find a way to make education more exciting. Preforming experiments is a great way for students to have fun while working. A simple test on how baking soda and vinegar react with each other can make a boring day into an explosive one! Without interest in a topic one might find it hard to complete an assignment on it. This is why students should be allowed to use topics they are interested in.

Although some may disagree students should be allowed to design summer break projects.

By allowing students to design projects teachers will find: The projects will come out better, students will be able to enjoy doing them, and their student will be less stress while completing. Some believe that it is more important for teachers to assign projects to students but this is not true. By allowing students to create their own work, teachers will find that the overal l quality of work, and happiness of the class will be raised.",4,Summer projects,Independent
9A165155AC0C,"Summer Projects for school should be Teacher-designed because it will show students the expectations for the course, helps them learn the specific material that is needed, and keeps students on track. The main part of summer projects is to assure that students continue their learning process. While schools have long breaks at a time, it is difficult to come back and still remember all of the things that was taught before being let out for a long amount of time. Teachers and student both struggle to jump back into the schedule of going to school each day. Many students have a hard time maintaining everything after being a way and not looking at the material for a while. Some schools require students to complete assignments or projects during a long period break to maintain their learning abilities, but if students are not given the right objective, then they are bound to not learn anything. There are many examples on why summer projects should be teacher-designed.

First, students need expectations and requirements for school projects because it shows them what the teacher will be looking for while grading. This can relate back to whenever a teacher is gone for a period of time or is absent for the day and tells the students what is expected of them while the teacher is away. Having expectations and requirements for a project makes sure that the student puts in effort and that the assignment is detailed with the right topics. While students are working on an assignment, and essay, or a project, they do tend to lead their way off topic and start to write about unnecessary details. Having a list or a checklist of things that are expected of each student helps them know what needs to be on it and it is easier to follow.

Most students have said that they prefer checklist and requirements than anything else because it is helpful to check off instructions and make sure that everything that is needed is on the assignment.

Next, having students keep the learning process going during the summer with help their growing minds, but if they are not given the right topics and material then they will be confused and would have not learned a single new thing. With projects, students are suppose to make the assignment talk and discuss a main point of a topic. Teachers usually make projects as specific as possible, if the student was told to do it themselves then it would be easy for them to not go into detail and specifics about anything. In school, most topics have a huge variety of smaller details and information that would not be a main point in assignments and projects. Students would have to follow what the teacher wants to make sure that they do not write down the wrong information. Most of the time, when a teacher designs a project, they usually give a variety of tools and websites to go to if they need more information on something. Those websites and tools will give the specific examples and info on what the topic is based on and it will help the students have a better knowledge of the main point.

Lastly, after focusing on one main topic for a long time, students tend to get bored and not try as hard as they should. Some students have a hard time staying on track while doing something school related on their own, they usually need some guidance to follow and go by. If summer projects were student-designed, the students would not be able to follow what they need to do and would not have any rules to go by. Different students have different ways of learning, some like to do hands on activities or web quests to learn, others just prefer to write down everything that they learn as notes. A teacher-designed project can give different ways of portraying the material. A teacher-designed project will also make students be on time with the assignment. If a teacher assigns a summer project, they will most likely attach when specific things are due at what time, for example: the essay portion will be due in 2 weeks, the rough draft is due in 1 week, the poster with the end result is due the first day of school. Most big projects that take a while to finish will have smaller tasks to finish throughout of period before it is due. Teachers can tell if students are on the right track if they assign things during the process of working on the project.

In other words, having a student designed summer project is not a great idea. If students made the project by themselves, the teacher could become confused while trying to figure out the main topic. Students would not follow any sort of guideline unless a teacher attaches it to the assignment. If the project was not designed by a teacher, then the student making it would not be great with knowing when to put deadlines and they would not be sure with what to put on the project. The summer project will most likely be done much sooner because made it clear when things will be due. If it was made by a student, they will more likely slack off and be lazy with portraying the assignment. A teacher-designed summer project would be the most efficient way to stay on track with deadlines, to know what to talk about or not, and it shows the requirements and expectations that the teacher wants to see.         ",6,Summer projects,Independent
3F04C12160E5,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. This helps them to keep their brain running. I believe that the students should get to design what project they want to do. Choosing their project will guarantee that they are focused while working on it, they will choose a topic that interests them, and their grade will result at a higher score.

Allowing students to choose their projects will help keep them focused on it. For example, if a student likes things related to writing, they will enjoy working on it. They will give it all their effort and time. It also allows them to focus more on the topic itself. Being home will let also let them be comfortable working on their projects. They will not be distracted by any classmates. They will feel less pressured by their teachers to get things done. They will be able to pace themselves. And their hard work will be reflected in their projects.

Students tend to get exited about a topic they are interested in. Giving them the freedom to do so will result in a better researched project. They will also be interested in similar things, so they will continue to research without them being told to do so. The quality of their project will be reflected by their interest in the topic they choose.

Some people may believe that getting their research project assigned by a teacher is better. I disagree with this statement. Students will feel the pressure of getting the assignment done because a teacher told them to do so. Some may even do the project last minute because they were not interested in the topic. Or maybe they were not comfortable working on it. Their efforts to work on the project will be decreased, resulting in a much lower grade. If a student chooses the topic they want to work on, and the time they dedicate to working on it, they will get a higher score. It will assure that the students continue to learn during their break.

In conclusion, a student-designed project will ensure they continue to learn over the break. They will get to enjoy their break and learn at the same time. A teacher-designed project will make them lose interest and effort. What would you prefer? ",4,Summer projects,Independent
4183BA00BE40,"Summer projects are dreaded by most students, despite the beneficial continuity in learning they provide during the otherwise schoolwork-free summer break. Such projects are only rewarding if they include information relevant to the corresponding course they were assigned for, making the idea of ""busy work"" both unecessary and hated by students (as is often the case in more open ended student-designed assignments). Teacher-designed summer assignments are far more effective than student-designed alternatives, as teachers can integrate necessary and prerequisite information for the course, the assignments are less open to interpretation and more focused, and students recieve an assignment that is both more impactful and less work-intensive.

Teachers are well versed in their respective subjects, and have a good understanding of what information is necessary in order to succeed in a specific course. They are able to structure summer assignments in correspondence with key information, helping students start a course off strong. My AP Biology teacher illustrated such a well-directed summer assignment last year. She included information that was necessary for the transition into an AP science course, leading to the majority of the class being well-versed in key concepts by the beginning of the school year. This was reflected by the class average of an A in the first quarter. The alternative of a less directed student-designed project would lack the benefit of being structured by an individual knowledgable in key topics and would likely prove detrimental to both grades and overall understanding.

More often than not, student-designed projects entail open exploration of a plethora of topics. While this can sometimes be beneficial, such open interpretation leads to less directed focus on the actual cirriculum, making the student-designed approach less effective than the teacher-designed counterpart. My computer science teacher assigned such a flawed project during this past summer, requiring students to merely explore and document anything computer related and create a project based on the findings. While such a project took student interest into account, it had little to no focus on the actual coding and programming cirriculum of the course. If my teacher had assigned us a project that required gaining a decent and basic understanding of code instead of an open ended exploration, we would have likely gained far more knowledge relevant to the course and a better idea of what the course's focus would be.

Students already loathe the idea of doing work over the summer. Requiring students to not only complete a summer assignment, but forcing them to design it as well is both aimless and unecessary. Teachers designing these assignments with intentful structure makes the completion of the such projects less rigorous and more impactful, including the actual cirriculum of a given course without forcing the students to do any extra work in designing the project. Students want to enjoy their summer and not be weighed down by a huge project. Cutting down on unecessary work would make students and teachers alike happier, as students have less to do and teachers have less to grade, making teacher-designed projects the logical choice.

Teacher-designed summer projects are more impactful than student-designed ones, as teachers have a good idea of what information is key for understanding of important concepts, they can narrow the focus of the project to aid in transition into the subsequent course, and they are less rigorous and more impactful. Students will appreciate the boost in understanding provided by a well structured teacher-designed project.",5,Summer projects,Independent
51980DE241EE,"Summer project assigments should be teacher designed and not designed by students. Most students cannot be trusted to choose a project design that would truly challenge them and help them learn the subject, and teachers are more well equipped to create a project format that is effective and user-friendly.

If summer projects were student designed, the project would be ineffective and students wouldn't learn as much from them as they would if teachers had assigned them. Students cannot be trusted to create something that would be challenging, and therefore a valuable learning eperience. Students would want to create a project that is easy to do and would result in the best grade for themselves, and cannot objectively prioritize their learning experience. If this was how projects were conducted, there would be no point in doing summer projects in the first place because nobody would learn from them. There would also be inconsistencies in the projects that everyone does, if they can create them indiiviually, students would have different assignments from each other and the grading would be biased. If the students had to come to the conclusion of one project designed together, they wouldn't be able to agree on one thing and each indiviual would want different things to be included in the project. In contrast, if things are designed by teachers, everyone gets the same project and it is not made with a bias towards what works better for one student compared to another. Teachers can be objective in their creation of a project so that it challenges everyone in some way. For example, my history teacher often designs projects in very different ways. For one unit, he will have an individual project that focuses on a complex and creative formatting to communciate the information learned in the unit. For the next unit, he will have a group project where people have assigned roles and have to execute specific actions and work together. These projects work well in a way that can only be thought out and executed by a teacher because they challenge students in the actual material of the subject, but also challenge them in their skills of formatting, public speaking, teamwork, and communications, which are valuable skills to learn in their own right. These are extra factors in a project that you woudn't get without the involvement of a teacher.

Teachers are also better at creating projects because they have more experience and knowledge with the concept. It is most likely that students have never had to create a project themselves before, so they wouldn't know where to start, what to include, how it should be graded, etc. Teachers have made many projects as apart of their jobs, and they know the design that tends to be more approachable for students, the material that seems to be the right level of difficulty, and how to grade it so that it is a proper evaluation of the student's abilities. Teachers are also well versed in the subject that they teach and would know the material that is most relevant and important to properly assess a student's understanding on. A student would have no guidance on what parts of the subject they learn is considered to be of highest value, and many projects are based on some of the most difficult concepts in the unit, so that a student is forced to spend more time with the ideas to gain a better understanding. Teachers are the ones who create the tests and quizzes that a student has to take on the material, and with this knowledge they know what students tend to struggle with and what parts of the unit should be focused on for an ideal learning experience.

One could argue that students should create their own projects because they would get better grades on them and it would be easier for them to understand, but this concept has too many factors of bias invovled and a student wouldn't be able to get a comepletely objective learning experience. If we only learned the things we wanted to learn, we would miss out on a lot of valuable skills in life and leanring experiences that help us with other subjects. If a student likes english, they can study literature and progress in that field, but they can only go so far if they only learn english without any teachings in history, math, or science. In the example of only learning literaure, there are many exmaple of historical references, scientific vocabularly, and mathematics in complex literature, and one cannot fully understand these works without a precursory knowledge in the other fields. Thus, projects cannot be student run just towards things they enjoy. Although it would be more enjoyable for the stundet to work on, it wouldn't be as effective educationally and there would be missing parts to the whole concept that need go be addressed.

There's a reason teachers are teachers and students are students. Students need to use their educational experience to focus purely on learning the subject at hand and useful skills for their lives. Teachers are there to help guide us to these goals, and this path is led astray when students start to do the jobs of teachers, and the effective system begins to fall apart. Educational experts are trained to know what they're doing, and it is our job to trust them and learn as much as we can. ",6,Summer projects,Independent
B1703E8A7555,"Summer is my favorite time of year. In the United States, schools have a little over two months break from school each year. During this period of time schools usually give students assignments to help them remember all that they have learned during the school year. It is very common for teachers and other staff to design these assignments for schools, including my own school. Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects should be student-designed because it would make it a more engaging and exciting experience for students, and it would help students be more productive over the summer.

Student-designed projects would make summer projects more engaging for students, while still expanding their knowledge. An experience I had with this was after I finished my freshman year in high school. Over the summer I had a ten page assignment for my math class that I had to finish before the first day of school started. This experience was very frustrating because all I could think about at that time was what I was missing out on with all my other summer activities. This assignment was very long and boring for me to do, when it could've been a lot more fun and exciting if students could've brought their own personal intrests and ideas into it. Another example was when my friend Generic_Name had to do an assignment for German class. The teacher asked each of the students to research one aspect of German culture and then make a power point with pictures with what they found. Although this wasn't a summer assignment it shows how assignments can be made more engaging if students can take charge in it. In this instance, Generic_Name was able to research a specific part of German culture she was interested in, and she actually enjoyed taking part in this project. Summer projects have the potential to be very engaging and could even bring in personal interest if they could be student lead.

If students were able to design their own summer assignments it would help them be more productive with their free time. In past years at my school, teachers have assigned specific assignments for the summer, but this last year they had a checklist of some educational activities one could take part in such as: watch a documentary, read a book of choice, go to a museum, and so on. I decided to go to a science museum with my family, where we learned about astronomy, oceanography, meteorology, and much more. This experience was very fun because I got to spend time with my family, but also it helped me learn even more about science, which I already love. It also helped me go outside the house and be productive with my time instead of sitting around and watching TV all day. Another time, some friends of mine told me that they don't even do the assignments until the last few days before school starts. These summer projects are not even helping the students learn if they're just rushing to finish. In this instance, the students were not even being productive with they're time because when they rushed to complete the assignment they could not comprehend what they're writing down. Summer is a time when people don't have too much going on, so it promotes laziness and procrastination, but with an interesting assignment it could bring students off the couch.

Some may disagree and say that teachers should design these summer assignments. Although it is understandable to think this way, this reasoning is flawed because teacher-designed projects don't always connect with the students. One example I have of this was with our summer reading book from last summer, 'Craig and Fred.' This novel was about a marine in Iran who found a dog and brought him back home even though it was against the military rules. I thought the book was very well written, and I appreciated this experience Craig shared with us, but I personally didn't connect with the story because I couldn't relate to the characters in the book and it wasn't a kind of book I usually read. When teachers give these kind of assignments it's hard to relate and have a good experience doing them. Bad feelings toward summer projects could be entirely avoided if students were able to choose their own book or even put in suggestions for them. I've had so many experiences in high school where I just didn't connect with or completely understand an assignment, and has resulted in it being very hard to complete. Some teachers can come up with fun activities for projects, but it would help students overall if they could have input in their projects.

It is important to remember that school is not made to stress students out with all the tests and assignments teachers give them, it is to help students learn all about the world and prepare us for real life. In the past teachers have planned out these projects for the summer, but I believe in the future that should change because it can help students see how things they've learned in school work in the outside world. So teachers, let students take charge for once!",6,Summer projects,Independent
20D092AFC4C5,"Have you ever imagined allowing students design their own summer projects? Would allowing them be beneficial to their learning? Many strongly believe that if students were to design their own assignments it would give them more motivation, but if anything it is not educationally helping them. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students would not actually do their assignments, the teachers know exactly what they want their students to learn during the summer, and it's an efficient way for teachers to prepare their students for the upcoming school year.

Many students always have a way of getting their teachers to allow them come up with class assignments but that is not always the best thing to do. If it is up to them to create what they need for the summer, they will not be productive. They can create something that they think is so much fun compared to the things their teacher gives them, but it could be something completely different to the subject their work should be about. All teachers know what every single one of their students need to improve on; they create assignments based on certain subjects an individual or the whole class needs help on, so that it does not become a huge issue when entering the following school year. I mean don't get me wrong, teachers understand that the work they hand out to their students can't always be boring and when it is time to create the students assignments they should include some interesting activities for them to accomplish. Perhaps allowing them to create summer work is in some ways practically, but it is a distraction in the sense of it could take them all summer to settle down on a project they want and if that was the case then they would have wasted their whole summer of learning in just thinking about a project they want rather than simply just getting their work from their teachers. Certain people do have their own opinions, but what we always need to do is put our students education first.

This should be viewed as a great opportunity teachers have for preparing their students for the upcoming school year. A strong number of people whether it's parents, teachers from different schools, or just friends don't believe that giving their kids summer work does prepare them for the next school year. In my past summers I remember that there wasn't a time where i did not have some sort of assignments to work on and I remember I always understood the first few subjects we were learned and that was because all the assignments I worked on actually helped me when school started. Many of my friends always tell me how one simple assignment did so much for them. I would always be lost and understand the new material from the very beginning. One simple project, work book, or even a packet of a certain subject can take a student so far, allowing students to feel more at ease and also allowing them to get amazing grades from the first few weeks of school. More so, it is a beneficial way to have more students succeed when testing time roles around at the end of the year. There has been a great amount of students who do strongly agree with summer projects being teacher-designed simply because they realize how remarkable the finishing results are.

When thinking of a subject like this a number of questions run through my head like, "" Would the students or I truly create something so efficient to our learning just by instructions given to us from our teachers that try to explain what we need? "". Going back to the issue on students completely misinterpreting their expectations; not all kids can come up with an assignment that covers the details they need to work on. From personal experiences there has been multiple times where my teacher allowed us to make our own projects that should cover all our subject units, but I completely failed because i would think I was doing it all correct and when it came to the due date and test time I would fail. This is just an inefficient way, especially if you want your students to actually do great in your class. I mean it also makes it so much harder for the students to recover and catch up or having to bring up their grades. In the end it's all about assuring your students will be outstanding throughout the whole school year in everything they do.

Student-designed summer projects might have a nice sound to it, but a students future should be in consideration. All these summer assignments should be teacher-designed simply because students will not complete their tasks, all teachers know the work their students need to improve on, and it's an efficient way for teachers to prepare their students for the following school year, so that it does not hit them all at once. Students could go through a great amount of stress if it were up to them and that could all end in a horrendous way, which is why it is not a great idea to allow them to create their summer work.  ",5,Summer projects,Independent
9C480C68AA9B,"If the Summer is plagued with more work we should be the ones to design it, so we can still be an creative and a hardworking student, have a strong understanding of the subject and voice out pressing matters in the world.

While us students want to be done with school and be free, it is scientifically proven that if you don't continue learning a subject you'll forget about the subject you're learning. To keep that retention, the students should create a project to keep you the students in check; It can vary from a research project to an presentation using key objectives in class to show how you used them in the real world. The position everyone should say is, yes to further have higher Graduation rates and Test scores, because if the students show compassion to their school work & their will to get things done, every one will succeed. When we work together, build each other up and help each other when needed the world becomes a whole lot brighter, nobody should have to be bogged down in a project that seems like it was made to have you suffer. This project should be fun and should make you want to complete it to show your classmates how well you did; It should also prove that you care for your work and backs it up .

On the flip side teachers did go to college for, four plus years and have been in this profession for even longer, so that is a great factor onto why most summer projects are teacher designed and so pressing on certain subjects. It's not supposed to be hard, the teachers just want he best for you, and have to teach you the schematics for next year or for life. It's similar to parenting, sometimes you have to be harsh to get the point through and the point is to get that student to be well rounded before he/she leaves high school. All the Teachers want to see is the students being successful and confident in everything they do to better on their lives. In short they want us to succeed to better on our lives; which is selfless and much appreciated.

Another way to choose a student project would be an voting system, a select few would pitch in ideas that are teacher approved, that way we are still learning the curriculum but in a different/ active way; After that the whole class votes, yes or no. If yes it goes on to other classrooms until the verdict is reached on if the project is fundamentally helpful and play a healthy part on work ethic. This project will help students with the strengths and weaknesses, they can either group up to get it done quickly or go solo a on their own pace. Instead of laying on the couch, eating, sleeping, overall being lazy they can make that brain work as if they were still in school, I'm talking about firing all 8 cylinders and constantly learn more on a rigorous daily basis

However, teachers are no joke though as they work day and night to give us students the best education possible, it's stressful being a teacher and in our eyes a worthy sacrifice.

Grading papers form 150 students and also having to stay on track and give out more papers is a hassle; thats why we have teacher aide's to help them get through the day which is selfless and deserves recognition. To every teacher, thank you for doing what you do if we did not have you we would not be here learning.

To add on to the previous statements, we can be more inclusive and have a battle of the brains where all teachers do a project & students do a project, whoever wins by vote from the school staff will get a a reward of their teams choice; these are all just ways to do school work but with a spin of fun & healthy competition, because seriously work can be boring for teachers and students alike ways we can fix this on a daily basis are:

Have an reward system regarding questions and candy.

Play an Kahoot game on the subject to engage participation.

Let students design homework or class plans.

Let them grade papers and see the process and life of a teacher.

Have students stand up and stretch.

Ice breaker activities.

Talk about foreign matters.

These are just a few ways to stick out from the typical, book work and paper.

Book work has dated back decades, Its time to modernize and find different ways to learn.

While for decades teachers have been prescribing projects that are an inch thick in paper, we have been struggling, we need change now; Change is good and needed change is how we industrialized and now change will be how we do our tests, papers, essays & projects. We should be able to choose what subject a paper is on and how should it be done, because in all honesty we are the future so we need to work on certain matters, problems & accessions towards our future like emissions, pollution & much much more. Student designed projects will talk about these matters and open up the public eyes about how serious we, the youth of tomorrow are taking it as serious as Gun control, College Debt and other pressing matters. Allowing us students to work and talk about problems all around us would be a pleasure to spread awareness on these subjects.

To wrap this all up, We the students of tomorrow would love to be able to control summer projects in terms of spreading awareness/ looking at hard topics the public usually avoids. To be inclusive and attention grabbing is the goal and we can push for regulations throughout the school system, a recent matter was opening high school later than usual and getting in the nitty-gritty with financial costs & Bus scheduling. We can and will build each other up on these group projects. In turn we are equipping the mind for the real world we can use steps the we gained form high school and teamwork to get the job done, test scores & graduation rates would be higher due to us engaging in school year round. To close, we can't get anything done without Teamwork and student input, we need to let students have a say in their education to let them be the best the they can be in anything and everything they do.             ",4,Summer projects,Independent
626DA66E75D9,"Creativity of the mind is brewed from life experiences and knowledge. In some schools summer projects are assigned to students for various academic or elective based classes, these projects should be soley designed by the students and not by the teacher. Teacher-designed projects can lead to an interference with a students out of school life, be restrictive, and result in a higher lack of motivation.

Summer projects have a negatively connotated aspect attached to them that has continued on for many generations and people. Most students and classmates dread to hear the words ""summer project"" mostly due to the fact that it takes time away in which they could have been using to initiate in other things to benefit their lives or even just enjoy themselves. As it is, teachers lack a general scope of what a typical student can accomplish within their summer, as everyone pertains to their own activities during that time. Having the project written and designed by a number of students, or even just by themselves,would give a better outlook on the reasonable things to be accomplished where a teacher only expresses expectations which sometimes cannot be met. It is easy to set unreasonable expectations when the person setting them themself is not attuned to do it. Having the project designed by students could lead to much more accomplishment than expected as well. It is easy to assume students would try to make the project easier on themselves but just because the project is student designed doesn't mean it couldn't be regulated or have certain requirements given to them by others.

Each student is unique with different qualities and strengths. By making a teacher design the project it ultimatley takes away from a students expression and creativity because of the specific standards given to them. Expression is an important quality when it comes to projects. Not only does it make a student think more, but it also enhances their learning because they can express their ideas in different forms. It gives them more room to come up with their own ideas. A student-designed summer project would give the students a vast possibility to individually express themselves. When a teacher becomes the sole leader of making a project each project turned in by the class is the same but with different aspects, like color for example, and don't require the student to be creative. This in turn could eventually dull their levels of creativity and expression that could have benefitted them highly in their lives later on. Overall, a student-designed project could positively enhance the students and their educations more than that of which a teacher designed in all entirety. Projects are given to a student over the summer to retain knowledge and learn, if a teacher then leaves them no room to grow then the whole project defeats its own purpose altogether.

Many students lack motivation. Whether it involves school or simple activities outside of school, most students find themselves procrastinating or not doing what they set out to do at all. This is made evident by the amount of students who do not do their homework or even classwork and is a stunningly large amount no matter the school spectated and monitored. Students already deal with piles of homework or even other work given to them outside of school by their family, friends, or even job. Giving another assignment to a student, over the summer at that, will likely not be completed. By letting a student design their own summer project, not only does it increase the productivity of the project, but it aslo motivates them to complete it, or at the very least put some work into it. When a student designs a project, they base it mainly on what they would find interesting to work on rather than when a teacher assigns them something they tend to have no interest in at all. In comparison, if a person were to get a job and dread going to work everyday, it is likely that they would eventually quit; whereas, if a person finds their job interesting or enjoyable they are more likely to continue and pursue that job. The same could be said for a summer project. Teachers focus specificly on getting academic topics as the main focus rather than if it would actually be entertaining or fun for a student to do and take part in. I believe this says a lot about why students should be the ones to design it for themselves.

Altogether, the preference between teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects weighs heavily towards the students. Giving a student the opportunity to enjoy their break from school, letting them express themselves, and giving them something they actually find interesting is an important part of summer projects most do not consider. Students are more than capable of completing their own projects and retaining their knowledge by something they themselves designed rather than an authoritative figure.",6,Summer projects,Independent
095F6D0A8377,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects in order for students to continue learning during their break; these projects, however, should be designed by students. Instead of sitting in a boring room and having no say in planning a project, students should plan them themselves. Allowing students to design their own summer projects makes projects more interesting and enjoyable.

Allowing students to plan their own projects gives the students more freedom to use their creativity. When students plan their own projects, students have the opportunity to decide what they want their projects to be. For example, some students may want to their project to be a science fair. If they had the freedom to plan out their science fair, they would be in control; which would allow them be able to plan about what each person could present at the science fair or even when the science fair will take place. In turn, it could allow students to be creative and enjoy themselves. Allowing students to design their own projects give students the freedom to decide for themselves.

While allowing students to design their own projects give students the freedom to express their creativity, it also shows that they are responsible. When they design their own projects, they show that they are able to make responsible decisions. For example, the students that wanted their project to be a science fair might have to consider where the science fair will take place and what type of concessions will be there. These are the decisions that the students will think about when they plan there science fair, and will result in proving their critical thinking skills and responsible decision-making. When students have the ability to plan out their own projects, they can be responsible enough to make good and smart decisions.

However, there are those who disagree and state that students should not plan their own projects because there would be too much responsibility for the students to handle; there would also be too much freedom and students can take a negative advantage or abuse that freedom. On the contrary, the students would not have too much responsibility due to there being a large body of students pitching in ideas. As a result, there would not be too much responsibility on only one student or a small section of students. Another reason why these statements are false is because with a large amount of freedom, student can be a lot more creative when designing projects.

In conclusion, students who participate in summer projects, that is required by school, should be able to plan these projects themselves. Eventhough some may disagree, their statements are false. If more summer projects were designed by students instead of teachers, more students would enjoy and appreciate summer projects a lot more. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
658D9641A1C6,"The end of summer is coming and you're required to complete a project, before going back to school. Some claim that a teacher designed project is more sensible rather than a student designed project,I think a student designed project is better because the teachers provide boring topics,students get the freedom to choose whatever, and let's the students show there creativity.

A student designed project, would be better because teachers provide students with boring topics;If the topics the teachers gave us wasn't boring than students would show more excitement towards the subject as a whole. Such as students don't want to be forced to do a project on something they don't really care about,teachers give out boring topics and expect high tier work from students. Teacher designed project would only be sensible if and only if the student had no idea what to do there project on.

Giving the students an option to design there own projects opens the door for them to show off there creativity. Students rarely get to show there creativity in anything,but if the project was a student based design then the project would be completed at a higher standard compared to a teacher based design. Student based designs would go more in depth with the project giving the audience a true visual on what the student is trying to show compared to a followed rubric that a teacher gave to you.

Last but not least,a student based project shows the teachers your'e capable of using self thinking skills. Showing your'e teacher you know how to use certain skills,such as giving them information on things you need to improve on and things your already good at.

some have claimed that teachers know whats best for the students,but I thought otherwise as the boring topics they give us,not letting us show our creativity and last but not least our self thinking skills.                                                  ",3,Summer projects,Independent
9C97C5A04635,"After nine months of endless assignments and fighting the desperate battle to balance academics and extracurriculars, summer break arrives for public schools around the country. Those three months spent relaxing in the sun can be a much needed escape for many, but they can also do a huge disservice, as the knowledge that was previously gathered slowly deteroriates with the sudden loss of daily learning. Schools across America have begun to hand out summer assignments for the classes that are to be taken that fall, and it has ultimately been a success. The question now is how these summer assignments should be created and then presented. I personally believe that these projects and worksheets should be student-designed and for the following reasons: students understand their own time restraints, they know what level of difficulty works for them, and they can see what is and isn't necessary to review.

First is the management of time. The only people who understand what kinds of schedules students follow over the summer are students themselves. Many teachers seem to believe that the summer experienced by high schoolers is similar to those in Disney Channel movies; they wake up at noon and hang out with their friends every day until school starts back up again. The tough truth to accept is that summer has only gotten harder with the passing years. Many students pick up part time jobs to gain income, while others take on their own academic hurdles, such as Generic_School. It can be extraordinarily difficult to find time to lift your head above the flowing current of busywork, which makes it more important that students design these summer assignments. They know how much time to set aside for academic work, and they can think through an effective time management plan which would make assignments not too short and also not too long: moderation.

The second point to examine is the level of difficulty. Students know what kind of work they can handle. From personal experience, it wasn't very fun to sit at the beach and attempt to complete the first page in a packet of AP Chemistry problems, but it was perfectly necessary and extremely helpful. The questions required knowledge from past teachings and a small amount of inference and research, and I completed the assignment in just a few hours. I had to read out of a textbook to understand new concepts, but the work itself was fairly simple. It's these kinds of summer assignments that students would be able to effectively compose, because they do in fact want a healthy challenge, just not an impossible feat. The difficulty levels should vaguely coincide with whatever class the work is preparing students for, without giving them the feeling that they are already back in school.

The last point is knowing what's necessary and what isn't. For example, a long assignment for an optional music class seems rather unnecessary compared to simply suggesting practice over the summer. If students were required to have a lengthy project for every single class that they planned on taking the upcoming school year, summer wouldn't exactly be much different than every other month. Students don't need a complete break, but they also don't need three more months consisting of the same grueling and tasking work. I do think that AP classes should be handing out summer assignments. But academic courses? That's for the teachers to decide.

In conclusion, students are smart enough to form their own summer assignments that follow the basic guidelines given by teachers. They know how to wisely create a project that doesn't absorb too much or too little time, isn't too easy or too hard, and is completely necessary for staying on track in school. Not every student would be willing to work on an idea for a project that would be assigned to each of their classmates, but every grade has several bright and accomplished achievers who would take up the challenge. Students know their own limits. We can set them for ourselves.",5,Summer projects,Independent
C068F7168129,"Every year when summer break rolls around, students become restless and excited. But as soon as they get comfortable and begin to relax and enjoy the stress-free summer life, the realization that they have school projects to do hits them like a ton of bricks, oftentimes draining the enjoyment from their time on break. Many school teachers find it easiest and most convenient to design a project and assign it to the students, but this just ends up turning into a chore for students. What if, to lessen the students' feelings of resentment towards summer projects, the teachers allowed the projects to be student-designed? Although some believe that required summer projects should be teacher-designed, in reality it is much more beneficial to the student for the projects to be student-designed.

Required summer projects should be student-designed because when students are in control of their project, they are able to express themselves and an interest they may have through the assignment. Teachers, when designing the project they assign, may feel that by providing parameters and a rubric for an assignment they are helping the student out. In reality, they are just limiting the student to think in the way the teacher thinks. On the other hand, when students design the project, they are better able to express a passion they would like to share with others. For example, a project that requires the student to read a book and do a report on the character symbolism simply becomes a chore in the eyes of the student. This student may have a passion for nature and animals, yet there would be no way for them to express that passion within the confinement of a literary analysis project. If the student were able to design the project by his or herself, it would immediately become less of a chore as they would have the freedom to do the project on something they love, be it nature, music, art, athletics, science, or any other topic of their choice. It is almost guaranteed that a student will put more effort into a project regarding a topic they are interested in. When students have a say in their assignment, it no longer feels like a pointless task forced upon them by a superior; thus, the quality of the project will likely be higher as they will feel motivated when the assignment allows them to express themselves.

When students design their own projects, they develop independence that shapes them as an individual and prepares them for later in life. By telling their students exactly what to do for a summer project, teachers may be making it easier for the student in the short term. In the long term however, they are restricting the student's independence and individuality by not allowing them to make their own mature choices in designing their own project. When a student is allowed to design their own project, they are making small choices that teach them how to think and make choices independently and creatively without constant oversight. As well as training the student to make their own decisions, designing a project teaches individuals to have confidence. This is a much needed trait for teenagers nowadays who often times lack the self-confidence needed to pursue something they have a passion for. It is beneficial to society to instill self-confidence, individuality, and independence in students so that they are able to pursue their passions in life. These traits that can arise from something as simple as designing one's own project prepare individuals for life in the real world to be productive citizens that can make a difference in the world.

Something as simple as a required summer project can have lasting effects on students if they are allowed to design it themselves and are not confined by the boundaries instilled by their teacher. When a student is able to design the project them self, they are able to express passions they may otherwise have no way to express and will likely create a higher quality project because of their interest in a topic. Also, designing the project by one-self instills confidence, independence, and individuality which are valuable traits today in teenagers transitioning to adulthood. Although some believe that required summer projects should be teacher-designed, the benefits that result from allowing the project to be student-designed can potentially shape an individual to be ready to go out into the real world and make a difference. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
5789A415F29D,"When students are on summer break they want to have fun. Some schools require students to do projects to make sure the students are still learning during the break. The summer projects should be student-designed because students can do topics they have better understanding of and students can learn more information on the topics they are doing.

Students hate having school work during summer break, but if the students decide on what topic they wanna do it can be easier and fun. The projects can be on topics students really understand and actually have interest in. For example, what if the student loves the solar system they can do a topic on that and really understand it because they find interest in it. Students that understand there topics have a better chance at showing their teachers that they really understand and they know what they are doing. The more students understand the better the project will come out.

While doing projects sometimes students need to look up information on topics they are doing. Students can learn more information on that topic. However , the teacher teaches students information about that topic, but what if they look up a topic and find more information than what the teacher told them . The students are finding out more information that can possibly help them in the long run. For example, say you picked how plants are developed, but your teacher gives you information about how plants are developed, but you find better information and its accurate.

Some students think that projects during the summer are boring, but they can actually help them understand the topics more and can become really fun . School projects during the summer time may not be fun, but can really benefit students in the end and actually help them. These projects can be very helpful and can even prepare students for the next school year. If more schools allow students to design their own projects , then the more the students will actually complete them.",3,Summer projects,Independent
A0A41E351FC9,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. The question is should these projects be designed by the teacher or by the student. Normally the teacher designs the projects for the student however, it may be more beneficial if the students design the projects for themselves. There are multiple reasons why the students designing their own projects would be more beneficial, they can choose what they want to learn about, they can use their own creativity, and the teachers can learn more about what the students are interested in.

Firstly, the projects would be much more interesting if the students chose what they wanted to learn about. In other words, they would be way more intrigued and enthusiastic about a topic they like than a topic thats irrelevant to what they care about. Teachers usually give student mundane topics just to keep them occupied for the summer. But now the students can focus on something they care about and will be beneficial to them in life. For example, a teacher may want the students to do a project about the history of Germany but a student who has an interest in becoming a doctor may want to do a project that involves researching the types of doctors that work in the hospital and what they do. See how the project designed by the student is most definitely more beneficial and more oriented towards the students interests.

Furthermore, the students can use this as an opportunity to tap into their own creativity. They now have the chance to create something that represents their own individual interests. The students can actually put their minds into their work and create something new and exciting, which would make them even more eager to learn. The students could work in groups and put their diverse creativity together.

Since the students will most likely design a project about something their interested in the teacher can has the opportunity to also learn something new. Like what their students like to do and would like to be when they grow up. The teacher could also try to measure the creativity of the students and implement a creative curriculum that matches the creativity of the students. Thus, increasing the students will to learn more.",4,Summer projects,Independent
9E1F768837D9,"Have you ever had an project over the summer, and you thought what If this was student designed ? Well I defer, I truly believe that if summer projects were ran by students it will be a major mishap. There are many reasons why summer projects should not be students designed. First, because many students are not going to forget about the academic part of the project. Also many students will not set an time frame on when and how to complete these projects. Then students would not know what strategies to remember or to use to study over their summer break. For example over the summer I had to read the maximum of six books over the summer, but I could never finish or complete my goal because I would most likely forget about reading over the summer, and I would forget what strategies to use to help me complete my goal. Finally, this why I'm siding with all projects should be teacher designed.

To begin, many students believe that summer break is not to really focus on the time frame that they have to learn or set their minds on nothing pertaining to school work or anything work academic. This is an reason why projects should not be designed by students, and I feel that teachers are going to give students strategies that pertain to what the students have learned during school hours. Also I know that teachers will give students an time frame that will allow students to complete projects, and help students focus on learning during break. I learned that many reasons why I could not complete my math goal during the summer. This was because I was not setting an time frame for myself to keep track and making sure I can reach my goal, also I would very so often forget my strategies that i used during school hours to help guide me. Next, this is why projects should be designed by teachers. I know that teachers would give us many things that will help us remember, and focus such as: notes work assignments that we have done during school hours, and also an time frame of when It can be completed.

Next, teachers providing projects I felt It would be more easier on students because students need an extra boost over the summer mainly most students would feel that they might not remember, or cant retain the information and can not complete. If teachers where to design projects for students,I know that teachers will have an due date on when and how to turn in your projects on time. This suggestion is really good for students, because If students made projects that they wouldn't know how to turn in projects, or when to finish them. My teacher makes sure her students are completing and finishing projects on this website called Schoolagly. This process is to make sure that any projects or work assignments are turned in and done correctly, And also with this process teachers can add notes and definitions that will help with projects and work assignments. To become more perplex on this topic this is the reason why students should not design summer projects,and because sometimes student wouldn't know when to complete or finish these projects.

Finally, there are many reasons to why summer projects should be made by teachers and not students. These reasons are based on the needs for students, and how some students need an teachers to help them concentrate on projects during the summer. Also so students need help from teachers to manage time frame on when to complete projects. Then students might need help from teachers on how to retain the information learned during school hours. But if it were up to most students they would look at it in a different perspective a lot of time students would want to design projects, because they believe that they have all of their materials that they will need for projects and sometimes they don't which makes it hard. Also this makes it complicated for students to make and time frame on when to finish the project,also some may need assistance with remembering what strategies they used to remember during school hours. To sum It up, I truly believe this is why teachers should make all summer projects to give students an helpful path to continue learning.

In conclusion, there are many reason why students should not design break projects. Many students are going to forget about the academic part of the projects. Also many students will not set an time frame on when and how to complete these projects. Then students would not know what strategies to remember or to use to study over the break. This concept is really important,and also helps make sure students using the break time for projects,and has an adult that has put material down to help along the way. Teachers creating projects will also help by not letting the students to get off course during break. Just think about it would you want your students, or child to have projects over the break and not have to proper structure for thier projects?",4,Summer projects,Independent
0821EB1AEDED,"Students often moan and groan about summer projects that their teachers assign them to do over summer break to assure they continue learning over the period they are not in school. The projects most of the time, have a set rule book to follow that was issued by the teacher and it makes the project boring and not enjoyable for the students to do, basically being a burden the students have to over come during their relaxing summer break. These projects that get assign should be more student-designed because students can be more freely creative with their own ideas, it will be more enjoyable to do for them, and they can continue learning in a more ideal way.

Having the project be more student-designed, students would not have to struggle with limitations and can be more creative and use their own ideas for a better outcome of the project. Teachers often put a strict instructional guide or manual on what to do and what not to do, during the assignment and limits what students can do and blocks any originality. However, having a student-designed project will unleash a wave of ideas and flow of creativity between each student that would not normally be received from a common project. The whole outcome of the entire project will be changed drastically because of the freedom students will have on their own projects and in which, in the end, will satisfy them. During research projects, teachers also frequently limit the student on what they can look up and use. If the project was student-designed, students can freely look up and use what interest them and learn about something that will make them more engaged into the project. They can not be held by idea blocking rules that will make the project disengaging, they can have creativity run free throughout the entire assignment and it will show. Overall, a student-designed project will make a more standout project due to the original ideas students will leave throughout the project.

The sound of a project over the summer break already sounds boring and a headache of a time for any person in school to do but students will always be more engaged in a project that will allow their own unique spin on it and uses a piece of mind from them. The thought of a project is always a dreadful one that all, will have a hard time to get them self to do it but a student-designed project will make it at least, a more enjoyable experience. Students can utilize their brain and knowledge to make it a project to remember and have fun while thinking of an idea to blow teachers and fellow classmates away once they return from break. For example, a science fair allows students to show a unique idea with experiments, this causes fun competition and a enjoyable process on how the project is going to ""wow' the judges. Speaking of competition, if the project would also have an incentive to try to achieve the best project, students would even be more thrilled. The student-designed project will show a big amount of their own ability to the assignment and make them strive for the number one spot. This would heighten the accomplishment of the project and give them a sense of excitement for their own unique project to compete with classmates. In the end, rather than having a normal boring project, students who have a chance to design their own project, will have a lot more fun and excitement in the process of doing the project, in which, will still allow them to learn and not interrupt with their fun and relaxing summer break.

Projects also have a based way of learning, a way teachers think it's best for our generation to learn, but they are not our generation, they do not know what is best for us, they just think it; by allowing students to freely design their project, they can learn in their own ideal way. When teachers assign projects that are related to the class, it is reasonable because it help us understand the subject more, but when they assign a regular project, especially one over summer break, it is often a misguided project on what they think students want to learn but does not really aid them. Giving the chance for a student to do something they want to learn about, will get them more engaged and give them their ideal way of learning. They would not have to worry about what teachers think they should learn but rather what they want to learn and will aid them in the future. Students who do a project about what they want to learn will make doing a project like that more enjoyable over a summer break rather than a set learning experience. They will gather more information to aid them in what they want to do, instead of being given something they think they should do, this will make the learning experience way beneficial for them and not waste their time in the long run. They can continue to learn educational information for them and gain more knowledge that matches their learning style and will satisfy what they have learned. Therefore, students would have a better learning experience if they could do projects their own way and had design freedom and not be held down by a set learning path.

Projects being put out during summer break will always be a boring and overbearing thing to complete and in some cases even ruin summer break for them overall just to learn information that teachers assign. Having the project be student-designed, however, will change the entire assignment in all, giving more creativity, better pacing, more enjoyment, and a better learning experience for students all around, it will benefit them rather than a teacher-designed project. All projects, even ones put out over summer break, should be student-designed because the outcome will have more uniqueness with student's ideas, the project overall will be more fun, and students will learn in their own learning way.        ",6,Summer projects,Independent
E37D480CD473,"Summer assignments are required by a multitude of schools accross the state of Virginia. But some school districts are considering breaking from the traditional teacher-designed summer projects and instead replacing them with projects designed by the students. This may reflect student desires, however, it does not reflect what is best for the students education. Summer projects should be designed by teachers rather than students because it would be in the students own best interest.

Summer projects are intended to be used as preparation for courses students are going to take in the upcoming school year. Therefore, how could students be sure of what content should be emphasized; what ideas are the most important; and what materials, such as books and web sources, are the best? Furthermore, teachers will have a far greater knowledge of the courses at hand. Often times theachers will have particular material they want to be covered or emphasized over the summer. For instance, many Humanities teachers have specific books that they want students to read. Even though these books may be longer and harder than many students desire, they likely cover crucial material or are written in a certain literary style that is going to be taught about.

Some may claim that in order to have effective learning, students themselves must control the different components of their eductation. While this may be true for some aspects, such as selecting the courses they wish to take, this should not be the case for summer assignments. This is because many students may take advantage of an opportunity to design their own summer projects, by making them as quick and easy as possible. While this may allow students to enjoy their summer break more, it compromises the very objective of summer assignments, that is, to enhance their education through having continuos learning instead of a complete break from school over the summer. Instead, if teachers were to design summer assginments, they would be far more rigorous, but more importantly, they would be more beneficial for students for the upcoming school year.

If student-designed projects are too easy, they end up simply becoming busy work. More difficult teacher-designed projects would challenge students, which may seem unappealing to many, however in order to grow academically, students need a stimulus to respond to. Moreover, students become stronger learners when they are forced to overcome challenges. These challenges could include: reading a book in a foreign language; reading a book that is longer than they would like and far more dense than they are used to; or having to perform operations with dificult mathematic equations, formulas, and concepts. Nevertheless these challenges will make students think heavily and help them become better educated.

Furthermore, student designed is better because they should complete assignments. For instance, students should be productive to complete all summer homework assignments. This proves that students should help with assignments that has classwork questions to work that much stuff. Obviously, completing a assignments should student designed.

44A286931141,"should students or should teachers design their summer homework? I had a really hard time chosing between these two since i can see why having kids design their own homework could be a bad thing but it could also be a good thing. I had it the same way about having teachers createing the homework, is it really the best choice? i don't know. I ended up, after thinking a lot about it, to think that kids would be the best option to create their summer homework.

These kids are expected to some time over the next 6 weeks to choose boring homework over their frinds, goodweather, pooltime, and other fun activities. What do you think that would end up in? them doing a little bit everyday or them doing it all a couple days before school starts and ruin the whole point of it? I think the later, but how do you change that? if they were part of designing the homework they would be able to make it more fun for themself and their friends and therefore be more motivated to do it more often than the last couple days of their summerbreak. If you want kids to do it more often than once every two weeks they need to be self-diciplined which creating the homework can teach them. They would have to be diciplined enough to not just choose the easiest way out but the most productive way out. Having them try and create homework for their summerbreak may start a chain reaction and make them more diciplined in doing their homework for the rest of the year since they got to experience the work and effort that is put into making their homework.

Some kids need their "" aha so that is why I'm learning this subject "" experience, which is pretty important because it helps them reply a subject to the real world which help them learn future things in that subject easier. I belive that having them help design their summer projects would help with that. I know personally that I never had it that way in woodwork, art, music or fysics/chemistry and I do belive I could have been so much better at it if I have my aha experience. I had that experience with english pretty quickly and look at me now a foreign exchange student writting a english sol. Another experience they need is the "" this is actuallt pretty fun/interesting "" experince. This experience is when you find yourself fasinated or having fun with school because you like what you are learning about. I had it that way with social studies and history which is the only reason I have a 108/100 in my history class this quater. Having them design the project would mean that they have the power to make it fun which gives them the power to make the class fun so they can have good grades and interesting conventations about what they are learning. These experiences could also help them figure out what they want to do when they get older, which is pretty important.

Despite seeing all these reasons why kids should make their own homework, I can also see why they shouldn't. I could easily imagine that a kid would take the level down so they wouldn't learn anything from it since they only know what they know and not what they don't know. I don't belive that kids and teachers ever is going to come to an agreement over the amount of homework. I also could imagine that a child would take the lowest work amount possible, which in my eyes don't sound like the purpose if summer projects. Where is their brain in this? having a fun summerbreak with their friends and family or keeping up with their learning? I don't think many children think far enough to keep up with their education when it comes to summerbreak.

in conclution I have decided that a student designed project would be the best way to go around summer projects/homework. I think that students should be able to choose what their project should be about, but I don't think they should have control on amount or level. I do belive that the benefits of having them design the projects overweights the the negative consequences of it. I also think that them learning how to be responsible and desiplined enough to make the project and actually getting them done could have massive benefits for them in the future. So why should teachers design summer projects when the student created ones have so many more benefit and is more effective?",4,Summer projects,Independent
9EFA79BF42F2,"What is something that interests you or a certain subject that interests you? This is a question that schools, who require students to complete summer projects, should ask the students. It is very important to understand what interests the students who are doing these projects. When students are doing a project they are not interested in, they are not as creative with it and they do not learn as much. I know from personal experience that when I am doing a project that interests me, I do so much better and I learn so much more about the subject. It is very beneficial for both the students and the teachers. If some students do not like it or are not interested enough, they might end up not doing the project or getting a really bad grade on it. I believe student-designed projects would be the best way to go because they will learn better and more efficiently, they will get better grades, which is very important, and it will help them learn throughout their break so that they learn so much more.

The first reason that I think student-designed projects would be better, is because they will be more interested in it if they pick something that they are passionate about. The project could be about subjects in school like Math, Science, English, or anything that is related to nature because those are some beneficial things to learn about. I know, from experience, that doing a project that interests you is so much more beneficial. When I was a freshman, my English teacher explained to us that we had to write a paper about something that we are passionate and feel very strongly about. We had to finish this paper by the time our summer break was over. It really helped a lot of my fellow classmates learn so much more about the things they are so passionate about. It was so beneficial to all of us. When we got back to school after summer break, everyone got to share what they wrote about. It was very interesting to hear everyone's point of view on certain things. I really enjoyed it.

Another reason that student-designed projects would be better, is because students can be so much more creative with them. For example, if you really love flowers and you are making a big poster project, you can be so creative with it. You can go out and take beautiful pictures, you can draw and color flowers, and you can search for interesting facts about them. Their are so many interesting things to learn about in the world. Students with creative minds should be given the ability to use them in their own way; therefore, I strongly believe they should be able to design their own projects and be creative and spontaneous with them. In order to do the projects, they still need the teacher's consent, but if it is beneficial and helps them learn, the teacher should be fine with it. It is amazing to see what students can do with all their creativity. The teachers can learn so much about their students' ability when they let them get creative.

The third reason I believe student-designed projects are better, is because it can help both the teachers and the students. If teachers just give every student the same project, some students may decide they can cheat off of their friends, especially if they are not interested in the project or just do not want to do it. If you let them design it and let them do the project about something that they love or are interested in, they will not be able to cheat and will do it on their own. It can also help the students get a better grade on it. If the students are getting better grades on it, then the teachers know that they actually learned something over summer break. I think it is very important to keep learning even over break because it keeps your brain fresh and ready to roll when school comes back around.

It is very important to know and understand what interests your students. Many students are so creative but some never get to use their creativity in school, especially if what they are doing does not interest them. It is very important to let them use their artistic abilities or any other talents they have by doing student-designed projects. Student-designed projects are better for learning and could be beneficial for students in the future even after they get out of school. They can learn many skills from doing them and it will help them continue learning. I strongly encourage teachers to let their students design their summer break projects for not only their benefit, but also for the students'.                                      ",5,Summer projects,Independent
45DDB26E6EF5,"My name is Generic_Name, I have took the position that the summer projects should be student-designed. Students should be able to designed their own summer projects, because it will allow them to get as creative as they want. For an example, they can use their own pictures, color, and words.

The pictures of the students self designed projects is the most important part of the project. It descibes what the person is talking about. It also provides extra details about what the student made their project to be. Pictures can describe what the people based their projects off. The pictures set off the main idea of the student summer project.

The color of the student project is a color code. That means the students can use their own color to descibe one part of their project. Students can also use their color to make their summer projects colorful. In other words, color can be use to make students projects creative. The reason for the color is to make the project bigger and persuade the audience to look at it.

The wodrs of the student summer project is basically to state the meaning of the project. That means it describes the Pictures, and the color they used in their project. The words are supporting details for their project. The main usage for the words in the project is to support the main idea of the project. The reason for the words is to make the the audience want to read it by supporting what the project is about.

In conclusion, I will take the position that Students should be able to designed their own projects for the summer. It is easier for students to create their own projects, because their minds move faster than some teachers. some students have the ability to create fun stories for their projects. I have supported my Position with details and reasons for me choosing this position. I hope you enojoy this Essay have a great day.",2,Summer projects,Independent
F393BAAAB876,"Summer is the best time of the year for most of the students; it is the season that brings them joy and memories. But, without an organized summer plan, the students are very likely to forget what they have learned in the school year. Because of that, some education systems suggest summer projects for students to practice lessons during their break. However, these assignments that are designed by teachers seem to be unreasonable overload and can ruin the summer vacation that the students have been waiting for. Therefore, students and teachers will both be beneficial in learning and teaching if the lessons are well-designed. Although some may say that teacher-designed projects will consist of more important lessons, those that are designed by the students will surely be effective due to its interesting topics and reasonable schedule.

Students will be more motivated if the topics come from their fields of interest. With these lessons, there will be less delay for students to work. They will explore new lessons that will later be helpful in their future careers; they would be no longer summer projects but are life lessons. For instance, in Generic_School, yearly, there are Capstone topics for students to research a topic of their own interest. There are still requirements that the topics need to meet in order to assure that students will learn new facts from their research; but, the lessons' topics are designed by the students. Because of the new learning structure, more students were involved in the projects which resulted in interesting ideas. These projects let the students to express themselves through learning. Another example, summer field trips nowadays are mostly created by students, and they are being applied to new lessons more due to their effectiveness in teaching. Letting the students to design the experiences of the lessons means letting they create their own memories of the lessons which will last longer than that of traditional methods. Being able to explore their fields of interest motivates the students, rather than compels them to learn.

Beside having a break and doing school's projects, students should have time for other activities. These activities are the main part of the summer vacation. But, it would be impossible for them to distress and try these new activities if there isn't any time. Junior rising students seem to not have access to summer break due to the overload works in preparing for the SAT and some of the school summer projects. Therefore, if the summer goes on with unreasonable loads of lessons and practices that are needed to be done, there would be lack of access for them to other activities. Summer is also the time for students to explore interesting future careers through internship and jobs opportunities. Consequently, looking at the bigger picture, if a student busy with the summer works from school, he or she will be lost in choosing interesting fields in the future due to their lack of experiences. That says, it is important for students to have time to access new activities that will determine their future.

However, there are people who believe that summer projects that are made by students will not cover enough important information, thus teacher-designed projects are the perfect choice. It is true that important lessons must be covered, but that only should be done during the school year, not during the summer break. Doing so in the summer will distress students even more due to their lack of free time. If the pressure on students keep gaining, mental diseases like depression and mood changes will appear. There are many students in Generic_School and high schools around the world have gotten mental disorders which origin is from school works. Therefore, the main component of the teaching system should be the effectiveness of the lessons, not the amount lessons that are being taught. This is a major cons of the current education system and it needs to be fixed as soon as possible. And the only ones who can truly understand the problem are the students. Thus the student's opinions towards the structure of the school's system are very important.

Projects and lessons should be designed by the students to guarantee the quality of the lessons. Through interesting topics,students will be more motivated to learn and explore new lessons. They will also have time for new activities, which will eventually help them in life. And more importantly, students will be able to avoid mental diseases, depression, etc; therefore, it creates a healthy generation of young adults. Overall, summer projects that are provided by schools should be created from the opinion and interest of students.",5,Summer projects,Independent
E215400764F3,"Have you ever received the most boring Summer assignment from a teacher and waited till the last week to do it? Many would answer yes. Summer projects are designed to allow for a child to continue to grow cognitively, while away from a continuous study at school. However, many fail to consider that kids are still on Summer break, resulting in fun activities rather than working on a project due 3 months away. In order for Summer projects to succeed, they should be student-designed to ensure engagement within the project, allow them to grow in a field of interest, and give the students an opportunity to express themselves.

Keeping students engaged in a Summer project is critical to the success of the assignments. A student is more likely to spend more time on a project that they are interest in, rather than completing required tasks that they don't want to do. Enacting student-designed projects allows for them to voice what they are likely to do that will keep them engaged in a learning activity. This allows the students to feel control over their Summer, and how they may want to incorporate learning into a fun growing experience. While they may voice their thoughts, they will also have a better understanding on what exactly to do for their project ahead of time keeping them engaged in whatever they need to accomplish. Providing a platform for students to express their ideas, leads to engagement and a product that succeeds the purpose.

For many students, their engagement in an activity comes from the topic, allowing them to have freedom as to what they create, helps them further their mind. This also allows for fun because they are more engaged based on their topic choice. Many people say that they are prone to doing better on an assignment involving a topic of interest because they care more about the product. Student's who care about a topic will give you a product that means something to them, expressing their creativity and effort that they put into an assignment. Lastly, these projects are designed to cognitively grow and maintain a child's mind over break. Learning about themselves is one of the most important ways of doing that; by allowing them to design their own project and have freedom as to what they want to do, you are allowing an opportunity for them to find out what they are interested in and understand more about themselves.

Finally, Summer is defined in a kid's mind to be a time of enjoyment and relaxation after a dwelling school year. With these Summer projects they should be associated with a similar thought. Student's designing their own project will allow for a creative outlook and give them an opportunity to create a better project than a poster board. Creativity proves to be effective in allowing for more growth than ever about how you may want to present what you learned over a break. Also when allowing a student to express creativity you are creating opportunity for them to incorporate something unique into their assignment which will further their engagement and growth.

In all, Summer projects would be more effective and beneficial to student's if they were designed by student's themselves based on an increase of interest, opportunity to grow in a field of interest, and ability to incorporate a personable and creative outlook. Student's will feel empowered and confident in their assignment by self-designing an opportunity to grow themselves. Overall the result and product will be more detailed and purposeful when engaging a student in something they enjoy while allowing growth in their self as well as their minds. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
B5CA9C10711C,"As the end of the school year approaches, I began to grow with excitement. Finally, I have a break from the stressful school work. However, as I thought I would be free from the chains, I am held back once again as teachers began to assign tedious summer project. Tired and with my strong desires of a break, I waited till the last couple weeks of summer before starting on the time consuming project. Recently, an argument has risen about whether summer projects should be student deigned or teacher designed. People who believe that the projects should be student designed may argue that student designed projects would increase the percentage of participation on these projects. Others, who believed that it should be teacher designed, argue back that the knowledge teachers have on the curriculum allows the projects to be truly designed for its main intention. Teachers should be designing these summer project because of their knowledge of the future curriculum and their understanding of the mindset of students.

Teachers are well equipped with the knowledge of the future curriculum, thus they have the ability to adjust their lesson plans to help assist their students for the upcoming years. Seen by many students, lessons or skills learned in the previous school year are used in the present school year. For example, math facts, such as addition and subtraction, are constantly being referred to in all math courses. Acknowledging this reality, teachers would try to shift their lesson plans around for the purpose of trying to strengthen their students ability to understand such skills. Similar theory is applied to the designing of summer projects. Teachers, with the knowledge of what is expected in the next couple courses of a students life, would be able to shape projects into helping the students prepare for the upcoming school year.

Teachers' understanding of the mindset of typical students causes the summer projects to be unbiased. People who believed that the summer projects should be student designed may argue that student designed projects will encourage for more participation, due to the fact that these projects will have a more simple design and be more easier to understand. However, lowering the difficulty of a project doesn't cause a dramatic shift in student participation. As seen in several classrooms, in regards to homework, regardless of the difficulty in the assignment, many student willingly choose to not complete their assignment. Therefore, attendance or participation is an irrelevant factor when designing these projects.

Having a easier summer project not only doesn't shift the percentage of participation, but also causes a strain in the development or knowledge of the student over the summer. Almost all teachers have witnessed students who refuse to complete homework, thus, they understand that lowering the difficulty would not change participation. This observation causes the teachers to not design the projects in favor of student's emotions, but rather design the projects according to the theory of helping their students.

Summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have understanding about future curriculum and understanding about the actions of a typical student. One of the main goals of a teacher is to assist students or help students succeed in life. Therefore, logically, everything a teacher does is to benefit the students. Teachers, unbiased about the emotions of a student, will challenge their students into achieving high goals. In their best efforts, teachers would try to assist their students in trying to acquire beneficial skills. Teachers understand that some students will try to challenge authority by refusing to complete assignment, instead of signing in defeat, they will persistent in their teaching methods because they understand that defeat wouldn't help the student. Thus, teachers should have the opportunity to design summer projects because they are guaranteed to have design projects that benefit students. Many successful businessmen, doctors, or scientists, credit their success to teachers. The profession of teachers have existed for many generations and have been known as the source of many successful people's success. Therefore, their ability to create a summer project should not be questioned.                 ",5,Summer projects,Independent
28CFE95203D4,"I think teacher designed projects are fantastic. Schools should require teacher- designed project because teachers have more experience and know more about knowledge than students, students will learn more, and there grades will look awesome.

Firstly, students will learn more from teacher designed projects. Students can learn new things just by the projects and different things. The projects are going to make things easier for the students. Also Teachers have more experience with projects and they know if one of there students is struggling on something she or he can put it on there project so they can do better on what there struggling on.

Secondly, students grades will look so much better then before with the projects. The more students do there project the higher there grade goes. Also teacher designed project can help you if you need extra credit and need to bump that grade up. Teacher designed projects are also good for summer break if grades are bad and you need to pass the class. Teacher designs projects are great for your grades.

Thirdly, the projects can help students with there knowledge. If students do more projects there learning skills will grow. Students will have all this new information stored in there brain and when a test comes up they'll remember everything they learned and score really outstanding on there test. The teacher designed projects will help all year long.

Teacher designed projects can be really useful to students. They can help you with mostly everything the project will help bring your grades up, learn new things, and make you smart. Thats why i require teacher designed projects in schools.",3,Summer projects,Independent
479A2864FFFC,"I am very on board with the idea that student projects enhance learning throughout the summer , but should the student projects be chosen but the students or by teachers ?

After extensive thought I believe they should be chosen by the students , but should have a firm rubrick and expectations on how to get full credit for completion of the project.

The thought behind student projects is to help the children continue learning even throughout the summer, so you want to make the project something cool that will make all kids even with different intrest, intrested enough that they will want to complete the project. I feel like if the teachers pick what the project should be about there will still be students who are not intrested enough to even bother completing it and they will see a sharp decline in the amount of students willing to complete a student project.

Now that being said i feel that there is a fine line between school appropriate projects and projects that are not. Students should not only be provided with a sheet that gives prompt ideas and lists what does meet project guidelines as well as a list of things that will result in a loss of points on the project. There are many things a student can come up with such as a photography journal with a paragraph beside each photograph explaining the significance of the Photo , or someone who loves astronomy completing a model solar system with why each planet is suitable or not suitable for life. Give them the option the express themselves through these projects not just throw something together because they want a grade.

I can also see the other side where people say that it should be teacher chosen so that they can provide detailed expectations of how the project should be completed , but you have to see that in a class of twenty or thirty students not all students are intrested in the same things. It will make the student who is not intrested feel left out when they see other people so excited to complete a project that they are gonna wait until the last night of summer and throw something together because it is not something they like. Consider all of the different personality types ? You cant have a one size fits all project because there will always be someone who it does not actually fit .

Thank you so much for allowing me to express my opinion in this paper. I am very aware that not everyone will have the same one as me but i do hope my argument made sense .",4,Summer projects,Independent
13233FB0483F,"Summer projects are a good way to make sure that the students are continuing to learn over the summer.

Most projects are designed by the teachers, and some are designed by the students.

Personally I would like to think that having a project designed by a teacher would benefit me more.

When a project is designed by a teacher, it insures that students know exactly what their teachers want, and makes sure that the students are not choosing extremely controversial topics.

Also, students who are given teacher designed projects, are generally more relieved.

In all, summer projects that are designed by teachers are usually better when it comes to providing detailed instructions on what to do.

When a student knows what a teacher specifically wants for their project, it typically rasises the score of the final product.

For instance, when I get a paper with detailed instructions on what to do, it raises my score.

This is due to the fact that I have done absolutely everything that the teacher is asking for.

It provides me with a list of things that I need to do in order to fully complete my work.

Teachers who design their projects often choose topics for the students to talk about.

This helps with making sure that the students do not choose anything that is too extreme for school.

For example, I typically recieve a paper listing several names of books that my teacher is asking us to read and write an essay on.

It helps by making sure that students don't pick books that are too short, too extreme, or books that are not advanced enough for their grade level.

It narrows down the number of books to a small amount that are all similar in length and that are at the students reading level.

In all, teachers that design their projects, for the students, often give only a few ideas that a student can choose from to use in their projects.

Which, in favor, limits the number of bad topics that a student might choose from.

Students are relieved when it comes to having detailed instructions for projects.

It also insures that the students won't have a project that is either too short or too long.

Instructions provide students with information that helps the student complete their work in time for school.

Students who are given instructions are often done faster and usually have a more developed and completed work.

I, for one, appreciate when a teacher gives me a project with all of the needed information on the instructions.

This helps by giving me a list of tasks to complete.

For instance, when creating a presentation, it is helpful when teachers give students a list of required information that needs to be included in their presentations.

I understand that some projects need to be designed by the students.

Projects that may need to be student designed are ones that include physical activities, and scientific/research projects, which requires students to conduct research and run tests based on what their topic is about.

Other reasons why some people might choose to let students design their own projects is that they may not have the time to create and fully develop a list of isntructions and ideas that could potentially help both the teacher and their students.

In conclusion, I personally believe that when a teacher designs a summer project, it relieves both the stress of the student and the teacher.

Teachers do not have to worry about whether or not they will recieve a piece of work that is too extreme for school, a work that is not advanced enough for the student, or a piece that isn't completed.

Also, the students are more likely to understand what they have to do: and in all, students are more confident when it comes to presenting their topics.

This is due to the fact that the teacher has provided them with the necessary information that the students need to have in order to hand in a complete work.",4,Summer projects,Independent
C4FE46E6BC7C,"The last day of school is the best day of the year for many students. It signals the end of homework, the end of tests, and the beginning of months of freedom. However, many schools require students to complete summer projects over break, hoping they will encourage students to continue to learn outside of school. While some argue that these projects should be designed by teachers to be a continuation of subjects learned in school, it is more beneficial when the projects are student-designed because they allow students to be creative, explore personal interests, and choose a project that will be realistic for them to complete without the resources provided by school.

Despite the strong arguments for student-designed summer projects, many still argue that teacher-designed projects are more beneficial to students. Teacher-designed projects are often a continuation of the curriculum students finished in the last school year, or work to prepare them for the next school year's curriculum. For example, a high school student transitioning from world history to government may be instructed to visit a local government building and interview a government worker to learn about their career. This would give them an understanding of what local government does for the community before they take their high school government class. However, for many students this would be a burden. It would feel like a waste of time if they were not interested in the subject assigned. If students are going to be required to do a summer project, it is better for them to design their own projects that they will enjoy.

One reason supporting why students should design their own summer projects is that in doing so they have the opportunity to develop creative and unique projects. By allowing students to choose any topic for their project, they are inspired to think outside the topics covered in school and produce a project catered to their summer surroundings. An example of this would be a student who is traveling to Europe for summer break. They could develop a project about the ancient architecture of Greece, the beautiful mountain ranges of Italy, or the exquisite cuisine of France. These projects would encourage students to explore their surroundings and bring a unique perspective back to their learning communities.

In addition, another reason why student-designed summer projects are better than teacher-designed ones is that they allow students to explore their personal interests. Without the restriction of subjects taught in the classroom, students can choose a topic they are interested in, ultimately making the assignment more enjoyable. If a high school student already knows what they want to do beyond high school, they can use the opportunity to center their project around working at an internship and learn valuable career skills, or focus it on studying subjects that will prepare them for college. A good example of a student who was not caged in by the subjects taught in school is Greta Thunberg. Greta's work in raising awareness of climate change and working with world leaders to improve the planet was not part of her school's curriculum in any way. If Greta had been forced to spend her free time studying subjects she had no interest in, she would have been unable to explore the fields in which she was passionate about. Therefore, allowing students to design projects that are centered around their own outside interests leads to more rewarding and beneficial projects.

Finally, a main reason why student-designed projects are better for students over the summer is that with the ability to design their own project students can make one that is realistic and achievable for themselves individually. Many students have summer jobs, visit family, or go on vacation over summer break. With busy schedules a large scale project requiring daily work would be too stressful or unrealistic for many students to accomplish. By designing their own project, they can design something that would be achievable for them based off of their summer schedule. Another common problem with teacher-designed projects is that they often assume students have access to the same resources that they do during the school year. Many students do not have computers or internet access in their homes, especially if they are traveling out of the country. A project requiring access to a computer would be unrealistic for many students. If a student has traveled away from home for the summer, a project involving local locations or environments would also be unrealistic. The ability to design their own summer project would be crucial for students in these situations, as they could come up with something that would work well for them.

In conclusion, student-designed projects are more beneficial to students than teacher-designed projects because they give students the opportunity to express creativity, develop unique projects, explore their outside interests, and design projects that work for their situation. Yet, no matter how summer projects are designed, it is important for students to continue to learn over the summer, and throughout their lifetime. Developing a sense of curiosity and exploration in youth will lead to a brighter future and a more innovative generation.",6,Summer projects,Independent
07BD57F7F45F,"Is a student to be trusted with the same decisions as an experienced teacher, even when the decisions impact them? The decisions in question are summer assignments and if students should be the ones to decide the nature of their assignments or if the teacher should still be the one to make the assignments. I believe it would be best if these summer assignments were teacher-designed because teachers understand what students need to learn, teachers have more experience with structuring these assignments, and because students may purposefully make the assignment effortless to complete.

The first reason these summer assignments should be teacher-designed is that teachers know what information students need to maintain a grasp on. Once summer is done, students tend to forget knowledge that is essential for a smooth learning experience in the upcoming school year. This may slow a student down and affect their learning pace which, in turn, may impede the whole class because the teacher may have to spend time bringing the student to where they need to be in the lesson. This takes time from the curriculum and results in the class falling behind in the schedule that the teacher set in advance. This can be avoided if the students are given a teacher-designed assignment during summer so they already understand the learning materials when the new school year begins. Some may disagree with this and say students may research the learning materials that the assignment must include. Teachers, however, are more familiar with the material for they have been teaching it for many years, they may understand what should and shouldn't be included because they have prior experience with the issue. This understanding of the necessary materials that students tend to forget is a significant factor when considering if the assignment should be student-designed or teacher-designed.

Another reason it makes more sense to have teacher-designed assignments is that teachers have more experience structuring these assignments to make it easy for the student to understand. Many assignments given to students by teachers are assignments used in the past because it is shown that they are efficient in making the material understandable to the students. The reason these assignments are helpful is because the teacher structured them to be easy for the student to understand. Teachers have been teaching for a long time and they know what works and what does not work, and they are able to use their past experience from making assignments to determine the best way for the student to keep the learning materials fresh in their minds. Some may say that this is a good learning experience for students to learn how to structure assignments. This proposition may apply to other situations, but it does not apply to this one because students may have difficulty structuring the assignment, resulting in a confusing structure that may confuse the students completing the assignment over summer. Experience is a very important factor when considering if summer assignments should be student-designed or teacher-designed and teachers have a significant and teachers are significantly more experienced than students.

The final reason a teacher-designed summer assignment would be superior to a student-designed assignment is that students may decide to make the assignment easier for themselves. Though they are beneficial, many students disagree with summer assignments because they believe their summer should be an uninterrupted break from school and education. Since students feel this way, they may purposefully make the assignments much shorter and easier to avoid doing too much work. Students would rather take the easy way to avoid doing work over summer, even if this means they fall behind in the school year. Students would argue that they would make assignments easier and shorter because teacher-designed assignments are too difficult and lengthy. However this argument does not stand because the length and difficulty of the assignments are designed to aid the student in learning, the assignment is not meant to be completed promptly, it is meant to be completed over the course of their long break. This pattern of laziness in students is an important contribution to the idea that summer assignments should not be student-designed.

Though controversial among students, summer assignments have a very important role in students' summers, they ensure that students don't fall behind once they return to school in fall. It is important that these assignments remain teacher-designed as opposed to student designed because teachers understand what materials students must remember, they know how to structure assignments, and unlike students they make the assignments helpful instead of making it easy. It is important to remember how these assignments not only impact the individual student, but how they impact the entire class.",6,Summer projects,Independent
32676DEE9A39,"Students look forward to summer time in order to relieve the stress of the school year.

Many students enjoy the summer break between transitioning into a new grade, however students dread the summer project that comes along with the break. Students are assigned summer assignments that are designed by teachers to keep students minds working, however it serves no purpose to students in their daily life. Consequently, students are forced to do summer projects that are irrelevant and do little to teach them anything. Summer projects should be student designed because students are able to express creativity, teachers are able to learn about their students' preferences, and students are more likely to complete the project.

Summer projects should be student designed because students are able to express creativity. For example, when my brother was assigned an open ended science project, he decided to build an exploding volcano with fossils hidden inside. He was not a fan of book work, and he had felt his teacher had finally given the students a chance to make something exciting that would surprise the whole school. As evidenced by the example, my brother wanted to show his creative side and give his classmates an interesting show that would excite the class about science. By the teacher letting him design his own project he was able to come up with an idea that would excite people and a display others would enjoy watching. When students are given the chance to be creative in school they take the opportunity because they want to associate school subjects with fun and show off their creative skills.

Secondly, summer projects should be student designed because teachers are able to learn about their students' preferences. For example, if a student designs a project on how height affects a persons ability to play basketball the teacher is now aware that student has an interest in basketball.

By allowing students to design their own project the teacher is able to learn about each students likes and dislikes and what they are interested in. This in turn allows the teacher to make lessons more relevant to what the students prefer and allows the students to connect the subjects to their interests. Teachers are also seen as friends to the students because the teacher expresses interest in the students lives. This also promotes high grades in the class and students are able to have a good connection and relationship with the teacher. By allowing students to design their own summer projects it could lead the teacher forming healthy relationships with students to promote a healthy learning environment.

Lastly, summer project should be student designed because students are more likely to complete the project. For example, my friend was assigned a history time line by one of her teachers and decided she was not going to do it, however her English teacher told them to create a project on any book of her choice and she finished it all in one day. As evidenced by this example, students are more driven to complete a task when it is a task of their choice and everything is determined on their terms. Students are rarely ever given an option on how to complete a project, so when given a chance to have complete control over how they do an assignment they jump at the opportunity because for once they are able to determine and decide what they want to do without the guidelines of anyone else. Additionally, students are able to convey their ideas across in their own way which makes them happy because they only have to answer to themselves and everything is done their way. Students choose not to complete work when other people assign it with stipulations, however when everything is their choice they have no problem completing a project because it becomes a way to express themselves.

Many people may say teachers get paid to create projects and assignments, however allowing students to design their own summer projects allows teachers to get to know students, students are more likely to complete the project, and allows students to be creative. It can be difficult to help promote learning over summer break, however by getting students engaged in the choice of projects it can be fun for the student and teacher. Students today are more creative than ever and it is important to help kids remain creative throughout their lives so new inventions and discoveries are made. School holds the foundation of the future and it is important to nurture the future leaders of the world. Students are the key to the future and innovation and it is crucial people let them have control and feel important. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
3EE81BEC8978,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Many people believe that projects should be teacher-designed but i do not. I believe during summer the projects students will do should be student-designed. They should be student-designed because more students will be into actually doing it then putting it off and never getting to it, students can have fun while doing a project, and they don't have to be forced into doing a boring project a teacher chooses.

First, more students will be into it. If a student does a project on their favorite movie, superhero, celebrity, etc. they will have more fun doing that. Let's say a teacher told their students to do a project on Abraham Lincoln, the students probably wouldn't be very happy about that. However, if a teacher told their students to do a project on their favorite TV show, then I'm sure that students would actually be excited about it.

Secondly, students can have fun while learning. If they did a project on their favorite movie, they could watch that movie and tell the class and teacher about all the funny, happy, and sad moments. You could also learn a lot of history by doing a project on your favorite movie, because you'll have to learn about the history on why they made the movie.

Third, they don't have to be forced into dong a boring project a teacher chooses. Nobody ever wants to write a paper on history and wars. If the students got to choose about what their project could be on it would be a lot better and easier to get a student to actually do it. If you tell a student to do a project on World War 1, chances are they won't do it, or they will put it off until the last minute. A student could actually be excited to do a project if they got to choose what it was about.

In conclusion, Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. I believe during summer the projects students will do should be student-designed. They should be student-designed because more students will be into actually doing it then putting it off and never getting to it, students can have fun while doing a project, and they don't have to be forced into doing a boring project a teacher chooses. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
B0AD7021AB07,"Kobe Bryant is known for his signature jump shot, the Fade-away. It's unique, it's effective, and it's his style. In the classroom, every student dreads the word ""project"". Projects are meant to test comprehension on a given topic. The problem with teacher-designed projects is that they are boring and predictable. The teacher-designed projects also have specific guidelines, which doesn't allow students to expand their thinking and express their knowledge in a way they would like to. Summer school projects should be student-designed because it allows students to show their own creativity, the students would put in effort with something they are passionate about, and teacher-led projects are too basic.

Lamar Jackson and LeBron James strive in their respective sports for one reason, their style. If every athlete were to shoot the basketball the same way, or throw the football the same way, then there would be no point in watching the games! These sporting events are exciting because every athlete has their own style of play. The same could be said in the classroom. If every student in a class presented a slide show or an essay for their project, I bet the teacher would fall asleep in an instant! Student-designed projects gives the opportunity for the students to really show their creativity and understanding in a way that is special to them. For example, a student who has musical talent could write a song about their project, or an athlete could make a game for their project. The options are endless! The purpose of a project is to test the students' knowledge on a given subject, so why not let them do it their way?

Imagine sitting through a class where every single student presented with a slide show; It's so simple that a baby could make the same project. Teacher-designed projects don't give the opportunity for students to really show how well they understand the topic. Repetition in the classroom is very toxic. Having the same boring project guideline for every student doesn't engage the students in any way at all. The student-designed projects show diversity and creativity; on the other hand, teacher-designed projects are extremely dull and unoriginal. The teacher-designed projects have such a strict rubric that makes the students roll their eyes. The biggest flaw of it all is that the students are only trying to satisfy the teacher, rather than trying to fully comprehend the subject.

When someone is passionate about anything, they give it their all. When I'm on the lacrosse field, I give my 100% every time I step on the turf. Passion in life forces the best result in any moment. If students were able to lead their own project, then an astonishing grade would be guaranteed. Kobe Bryant is one of the basketball players because of his passion for the game and the amount of work he puts in to get better. In the classroom, students would put in a tremendous amount of effort if they were given the chance to do a project in their own way. Whenever I get a project assigned, I tell myself that I will start working on it the next day. If I were able to put my own twist on a project, I might be able to finish the whole assignment in one day!

The way Carlos Santana strums a guitar is iconic and infamous; no other living creature can imitate his style. In the classroom, an assignment is ruined when the students don't get to show their creativity and way of thinking. Teacher-designed projects make students think inside the box, and they are trapped with a specific set of rules that they cannot pass. Projects are meant to test the student on their knowledge on the subject, but most students only do the project for a passing grade and not for their own comprehension. Summer school projects should be student-designed because the students are able to form something in their own style, they would put in effort into something they are passionate about, and the teacher-designed projects are plain and disgusting. A teacher-designed project is a vanilla ice cream cone, while a student-designed project is an ice cream cone with nuts, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
28314B1AC842,"Throughout our school career's projects are often assigned to extend learning during the summer break. Summer projects are more often created by teachers. These projects are rather extensive due to the months that are given to complete it. Those who may oppose state that it is the teachers job to create these summer assignments and they are able to bring more structure to the project. Although some may disagree that student projects should be designed by teachers, it should be known that this is not true.

Students creating their own summer projects can benefit them as students. Assignments that are completed by students are created by teachers, followed by a due date in which it is to be completed. After the assignment is completed the moving on to the next. Over time assignments become a chore and are less likely to be completed by students. Allowing students the chance to create their own summer project that they would truly excited to work. Through their own creation topics that students are interested about can be integrated into the summer project. Even though the summer project could be less structured it would completed time and time again. Having created their own assignments students would better understand what is to be expected in the terms of how to not only completed but also pass. Once on summer break students are unable to contact teachers if they have any questions about the project through having created it themselves this would eliminate the unanswered questions. If students were allowed to create their own summer projects it would give them a sense of control over their learning that is often lost throughout the school year. Some students can become detached from their learning with endless amounts of work that is assigned to them. Through the creation their summer projects it would also allow students to place their input and become more hands on within their learning.

Through creating their own assignments, students are able to build qualities that are helpful in a work environment. The process of coming up with rubrics and topics in which the assignment could be upon can be difficult. Team collaboration is vital for creating an assignment along side teachers and other students. Having the ability to voice an idea or criticism can be useful not only within school but also in an work environment. Not only having to create but also complete their assignment helps develop a sense of work ethic that is helpful in any situation. Students often rush to complete assignments very last minute and having formulated the assignment they would have a better understanding of how to space out their time to complete the summer project correctly. Along with school assignments this skill can be applied to any work place.

Summer projects can help extend learning outside of school during summer break. Through students creating their own summer project there is a better understanding of the project but also an excitement to complete it. Having created their project a sense of control over students learning can be gained which is often lost throughout the school year. Those who oppose may state that teachers should create summer projects because they have more experience than students and that teachers are able to introduce new topics to students. Students are often detached from their learning; therefor, allowing them to create a project that could possibly worked on for months can help student regain their love of learning.",4,Summer projects,Independent
F5B2DED407D1,"Summer, A wonderful season to spend time with family and friends. when students think about summer we want to relax, go to the mall, and do other events but once we realizes that we have a summer project, most of the time it's notices last minute so knowing student it won't get done. My mother once said "" If you want something done then get it done and show them you're capable"". Since then this saying stuck in my head so it should be student-designed because it can show the skills that they have, it tells the teacher that they understand the project, and students can fun with the project in the short time they have to do it.

Firstly, Every student has their different ways of do things and skills are one of them because by students designing the project it gives students the try to proof them self. All students are talented in their own way. Some students show their skills of they what they know how to do and how they expess it but one thing about skills students enjoy doing them and they can do what they most time.

Secondly, By students designing the project; it tell the teacher that they understand because it's important for the students to key points about project and it shows the teacher that they didn't care about it or they just didn't understand so when school start again the teacher know their strong and weakness so as the teacher they can help the students and guide on the right path.

Finally, In conclusion by students designing they can enjoy doing their project and happy to finish it the frist week they get it and continue enjoying their summer vacation while they still can and a good way for student to expess them self in their work to show the teacher a little bit their up coming student for the next year.",3,Summer projects,Independent
88273D2F8BB4,"Imagine that you are a student in high school and your English teacher assigns you a huge summer project that you must complete and turn in in the middle of your summer break. what would happen to all your plans that you have planned out to do in the summer? would you be able to relax and enjoy your summer break? many students in high school get assigned summer projects that seem difficult for them. summer projects should be student-designed and there are many reasons on why they should be like this.

Many teachers disagree that summer projects should be student-designed instead of teacher-designed. some teachers believe that assigning a summer project to there students but not making it student-designed is good for there students because it makes it harder for them and it'll make them learn something from it. sometimes a student will be assigned a project and if they do not finish it there teacher will make that students turn it in and work on it over summer break. another reason on why some teachers believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed is because a student may not be organized with there work. also, sometimes teachers don't want there students to work on a project in a group with there friends.

Even though some people believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed, students should be able to work on there projects over there summer break by having it be student-designed. imagine all the stress a student may have to go through if a project is too difficult and confusing for them, by making a project student-designed a student will have less stress and will most likely succeed with there project and get a good grade on it. another reason on why it should be student-designed is that they can work with there friends as a group and they can finish there summer project quicker, by doing this a student will have more time to enjoy and spend there summer break with there family and friends. lastly, students should just be able to actually like doing there projects and the only reason on why they would like it more is by having it be student-designed

Sometimes students don't like when a project is teacher-designed and will refuse to do there project, some students also struggle with reading and writing and when there project is student-designed they can go on different websites and search things up that'll make it easier for them. when a student has a teacher-designed project the teacher will most likely not want there students to go on different websites so they can get help and they'll want there students to try and think of everything on there own.

In conclusion, all summer projects should be student-designed so that students will feel less stressed and have more time to spend there summer break with there family and friends.",3,Summer projects,Independent
6A273D6F0816,"It's the last day of school, and students are sweating bullets eager for the clock to kick off their summer vacation when the hour-hand strikes two. Suddenly, collective groans echo throughout the entire school when an english teacher hands out a summer reading project. Many schools require students to complete some kind of assignment during their summer break because the school boards believe that it will ensure continued learning. Summer assignments usually ask that students read a book over the summer and fill out some type of summary or chart. Many students have great disdain for summer projects because they can act as a looming annoyance waiting to be accomplished. Summer projects should be student-designed because it gives students the ability to work at their own pace, promotes interest, and prevents students from copying eachother

Allowing students to design their own summer project allows them to work at their own pace. Schools usually don't account for what home or family students go back to during the summer. A student might go back to a family with elderly or children they have to take care of thus filling up their schedule. Schools also don't account for students who have jobs during the summer. If a teacher assigns a project that consists of several pages of charts, summaries, or questions to fill out, it can slam a ton of stress on students going home to a busy schedule. Giving students the ability to design their own projects benefits students who will be busy over summer break because they can reserve whatever time they can scrap up for making a project that makes their life easier. Although not encouraged, this freedom also gives students who procrastinate the ability to make their sleepless night completing said project the day before school starts less stressful. Since every student is different, every student benefits with the power to work at their own pace.

Giving students the freedom to design their own summer project also promotes interest in the assignment. For typical summer projects like reading a book, students are usually given a reading list of books and they're required to read one of the books on the list. The lists arguably always consist of books that students find boring or repetitive when they go over topics they've already studied in the past. Students won't be interested in works they find boring or repetitive so when they're making a project off of it, words, reasoning, and justification will seem empty and made up on the spot. If students are allowed to pick any book they'd like to read over the summer and make an assignment off of it, their interest and passion might shine through in their interpretation of the material. Some might say that assignments students make up could be counterproductive since they might not have anything to do with themes or topics that will be learned in the coming school year. On the other hand, teachers can simply just note as a minor requirement that students must make one quick connection from their project to any theme that will be studied in the school year.

Letting students design their own summer projects also prevents them from copying one another. One tactic that students will typically use with summer projects like reading a book of their choice and filling out the same chart is to read the same book as a friend and then copy each other answers when they have to turn the project in. If students design their own project, they'll have to show some individuality and creativity on the due date. Teachers will have an easier time telling when students copy each other because if done right, no student should have created the same project. If two students are caught clearly copying off each other on a project meant for individuality, they can be punished accordingly. Everyone will turn something different in at least some way when they aren't spoon fed a big packet and instead get to create their own packet.

Overall, both students and teachers benefit when students are the ones who make the summer project because students work at their own pace, create something they might be interested in, and display their individuality in learning more accurately. Students who procrastinate, have jobs, or take care of family over the summer will heave a sigh of relief. Students will be grateful they'll have a more creative, individual project to complete when they're bored during the summer and not a big, scary one that's due the day they get back to school. Less groans will echo throughout schools when students hear that they have more freedom in an assignment given for what's supposed to be a break. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
D0279F114F87,"Some schools assign summer projects for students to finish before the next school year comes around. The purpose of this work is to push the student to grow and learn on their own time. For example, teachers give book assignments where the student must read, then write an essay about the book. The topic of the summer project may be interesting to some, but cause other students to hate the work. Teacher designed summer projects should not be permitted and forced onto students.

One reason that teacher-designed summer project should not be permitted is that, teachers don't know if the topic they chose will interest everybody. Students know what they themselves enjoy, so why force them to do somehting they may hate. When teachers assign summer projects its interrupts, and steals, the break that students need and deserve over the summer. If the project were chosen by the student then the subject would be something of their interest, and the project wouldn't be seen as such a nuisance. A students main priority during the summer should be to have fun. If a student enjoys the topic that they chose for their project then it wouldn't be interrupting the break, they well deserve, it would just be adding to it. For example, instead of reading, ""Lord of the Flies,"" students should be able to pick a book on a topic they as an individual enjoy.

Another reason that teacher-designed summer project should not be permitted is that, students dont have the time or energy for it. Students who were just learning how to write essays a few years back are now getting jobs and paying bills. Those students, society believes to be little children, are now working twelve hour shifts. As a student, with a job and bills to pay, work is very consuming of not only time but also energy. If a student does not have the time or energy for the project then nothing will get done. But if a student is allowed to pick their own topic then they will make time for it. People make time for things they like, for example, intimate relationships, sports, and friends. Student-designed summer projects would encourage the student to do finish their work, knowing that its something they enjoy.

Although some believe that if the summer project is student-designed then they wont learn anything or grow, but they are wrong. No mater what topic or subject is chosen for the summer project, or for anything in life, there is always something more that a person could learn and gain from it. Students know what they like, so they can chose the topic but in the end its still a project and its something the students must put work and thought into, pushing them to grow. When the project is student-designed the person doing the project would have more motive to finish the project well and learn even more on the topic, than if a teacher designed the project. Having the students interest in a summer project could make them want to learn more, instead of forcing them into more stress.

Each student is unique and likes different things. Schools should stop pushing them complete things that they dont like or understand. One way schools could fix this is by assigning a paper two months before the end of the school year asking for a detailed explanation of what the student wants to do for their summer project. The school or teachers could pick the way that they want the project ot be done but allow the student to chose the topic. By letting them chose the topic of the summer project it would help the students feel less stress and allow them to enjoy their summer while continuing to learn and grow. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
B3341D036468,"Summer-break, which traditionally takes place in June/July and ends August/September, is a great time off, a far distance given from the classroom. Because of this great distance from a learning environment and the fact that the summer break is the longest out of every other break in the school year, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they keep up to speed, with school content. These summer projects are traditionally teacher based, but recent years have given students more freedom. However, these summer projects should remain teacher-designed because of the content covered in the classroom, as well as the teacher having knowledge on what material will be covered in that following year after summer break, given that they actually end up teaching the content planned for that year, which is a valuable insight for the students. Additionally, many students are still in touch with the classroom environment, and it gives a smoother transition to those students who come back from their periodic break.

Teachers in the classroom face a struggle, that comes after the periodic amount of time that summer break takes. What will the content consist of? What will be the new learning objectives for the students when they come back from their break? That is why during the summer break, teachers designing specific projects that aim to target learning objectives that they themselves know, are important for the students to get a grip of, as well as still sticking to the curriculum, which greatly benefits students in the way that they actually get a sneak peek of what next year's curriculum could be built as. In addition to this, students get valued ""class time"", so even though they might be on their summer breaks, and they might not possibly do the projects to the best of their abilities, they are still soaking up valuable education time that you could only gain in class. For example, in schools that do not hand out or require students to complete projects during the time of the summer break, these students tend to forget some important learning objectives, simply due to the fact on how much time students have spent outside of school. But those who do indeed assign summer projects, give students a peek into the upcoming school year, which definitely does give a boost to the students preceding knowledge prior to the school year, as well as encouraging possible additional studying, which all leads to a future of a bright learning environment.

Another important factor on why it is essential for schools to give out teacher-designed projects is to bring out more of the ""integration period"", or coming slowly, back to the school environment in order to prepare them for learning. Teachers find this valuable so that they can get their students ""accustomed"" to their classroom environment before even stepping through the door, which is very precious for most teachers, given that in a school year, teachers take around a month and a half before all the assignments and daily motions become routine. In a time where every period counts, this is a major victory for teachers, as their designed projects can go over and reflect on the material that they hope to teach their students, which gives them a starting to the school year edge, above all. Students often struggle at the beginning of the year at first, because of the time they have taken off, without any classroom instruction, which is also an adjustment period. Teacher-designed projects enable students to take the initiative, while on vacation and step up to learn important material that has basis, and will be taught in class at some point.

Even though student projects allow for the students to choose their own projects, and whatever central topic of focus that they have the most interest in, students will still choose topics that might not be relevant to them in education, whereas teachers have the best idea due to the fact that they, and them only teach the curriculum. In addition, teachers know exactly what learning objectives are prioritized, while students might have a faint idea, but not close to what the teachers understanding of the goals and learning objectives that he might have set for his/her students. Specific examples would include how in English, summer reading projects would be assigned so that when the students returned back, they would have that ""touch"" with their books, and their education beforehand, so rather than deal with the trivial, novel things that teachers would normally do at the beginning of the year, they are allowed to follow the curriculum, full stretch.

In conclusion, teacher-designed projects help students due to the amount of content covered in the classroom, as well as teachers having knowledge on what will be covered after summer break which benefits students greatly, and begins the integration into the classroom, before even stepping foot into the classroom. This also alleviates the pressure on teachers greatly, as they can plan more accordingly giving their own designed summer projects to their students in the classroom. Students benefit from this due to how they are accustomed earlier then usual in the classroom, while teachers are benefited due to how they are able to focus on specific learning objectives that might be of importance. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
ECE6DB354262,"Imagine, you are a student stuck doing a required assignment you truly dislike;summer break is almost over and you don't have the motivation to complete it because schoolwork feels like a chore. The information your teacher discussed in class left as soon as the last bell rang in June, so you're also clueless. You might shrug it off until the last moment or just not do it at all.

To avoid this dilemma, schools that require students to complete Summer assignments should give students the freedom to design the project themselves. If students are truly passionate about their work, they would be more likely to complete the assignment. This way students maintain the information they obtained in class and have an outlet to express their creative side. This may also benefit students who cannot learn in a classroom setting due to severe anxiety or other mental illnesses and are confused for the next year. It can be hard reteaching yourself something but not if you put your heart into it and design a project to fit your academic needs.

Teacher's may argue that students will choose an easier route and not challenge themselves. They will also argue they worry that the students wont be creative. To avoid this teachers should create a rubric that the students must follow. This allows the teacher to grade the project on effort, creativity and neatness but also allowing the student to do what they please with the assignment. They may also fear that students might be inappropriate with their designs. However, teachers can discipline them by reporting them or writing them up.

Education is important and Summer projects can be tough. Especially if you're in no school mode already. If students are able to design their own projects they can reteach themselves what they might have forgot over Summer break. Not everyone learns the same so this would give students an opportunity to expand their minds. ",3,Summer projects,Independent
C04E9948DEEA,"Most of the time people are given tasks that must be completed or accomplished by a specific time; however, the task given might not be what one truly wants to do which could lead to lazy work or under achieving expectations. Having that sense of freedom to do what you want is what we all strive to have. The willingness to complete the task at hand goes up as well. Ultimate freedom comes in many forms, but summer vacation is the best example of that especially for a student, and by giving them work restricted to a set rules or guidelines is like putting a wild lion in captivity. Summer projects should be designed by the students because at the end of the summer it would of been thought up, made, revised, edited, printed, and turned in by the student so it's only fair to let them have some fun with it too. It's something about being able to be ones own boss that makes work seem less like work.

Freedom is the name of the game and most people really like to participate. This may seem like not a big deal at the time, but to some people just a little slack off the rope is enough for them to run for miles and they will benefit greatly because of it. My mom once said to me, ""a little goes a long way."" Giving a student the opportunity to talk about whatever topic they see best fits is beneficial because, not only will this make them want to do it, but they will also be able use their imagination to complete the project. Personally if a teacher tells me to write an essay on per set terms and topic i'm going to struggle, not want to do it, and not have any type of motivation because the topic is not interesting to me personally; although, if i'm given the chance to do a personal essay then that is when I can what i want and talk about what I want.

Another big thing to consider is if they are willing to do what you ask of them on the rules pre-determined. willingness to do something is night and day and it shows; for example, if ones parent tells then to clean their room they are less willing and will probable not do a good job at it, but if one makes the choice on ones own will being then they will do it at a high success rate. As of now most people, mostly adults, end up doing what they want later in life because its what satisfies them. if one hates their job they are nine times out of 10 going to find another job that suites them and that they enjoy. By giving the students the willingness to do as they please it will relieve stress and hopefully end up with a higher rate of completion

In conclusion freedom, the ability to think for ones self, and taking pride in what we do is what we all want in life, being able to go to sleep feeling happy and accomplished. By giving the student the chance to spread their wings and do as they see best fits for them is beneficial in the long run, especially when it comes to something as important as school grades. Something as simple as the way the student approaches this assignment can and will effect their grade and maybe even their life forever. So next time a summer project is given just let the students have some fun, it is summer vacation after all. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
D72B8EA15C83,"Many high school teachers will assign summer assignments and projects for their new students to do before starting their class whether it be AP biology or algebra I. I believe that these summer assignments should be teacher designed because they know the curriculum a lot better than the students would, the students could take advantage of to opportunity to create their own assignment, and it would put less stress on the student to have the assignment already made for them that they would just have to complete.

Teachers are specialized in all of the subjects they are teaching students. They have taught these courses time and time again, and therefore know what materials and objectives students should understand when coming into their class or the first time. It is beneficial that a student has a little bit of background knowledge on the class they will now be taking. For example, going into a math class such as advanced functions and modeling, the teacher expects the student to know some algebra I and II, so he or she might give them a packet with some algebra to keep the student refreshed and prepared. Having a student design their own project to allow there to be analysis of the wrong information that may not be necessary to know for the class they soon will be taking. Or, the student does not go deep enough into the right kind of information.

If a student was given the opportunity to create their own summer project, that could go two ways: The student actually puts forth effort and creates a well done assignment, or the student takes advantage of the opportunity to make their own assignment and would create a project that would not benefit them in any way due to lack of effort. Many high school students, like myself, will put in the bare minimum of effort when told to do an assignment, or do anything for that matter. Having the project made for the student allows for the student to do research and find the answers to problems that may be on it. Since the student is not familiar with the subject they are doing the project for, they could lack the information needed in their project to actually grasp the subject as a whole as well. For example, if a student were to be assigned to create a project for history, they could do a paper on an individual they already know in and out. If a teacher were to assign a historical figure to a student, that could be an opportunity for the student to learn about a whole new individual they may not have known anything about initially.

Having a project or assignment already created for the student could relieve a little bit of stress on their summer vacation. Students may be assigned more than one project to do during the summer for a variety of classes they may be taking. Having to design their own projects and then proceed to complete the projects they have outlined for all of their classes could be quite stressful on the student. It summer after all, so students should have a little break to enjoy it. Having the projects already set up and ready for them to complete it would make the life of the student more livable.

You could argue that having the student design their own projects allows them to have some discipline and order for how they spend their time, but it is summer time! Let the kids live it up for a couple months, they will be right back in to the stress of school right back in August.

Summer is a time to allow students to relax and enjoy their vacation. Yet, they do have to keep some curriculum fresh in their minds with the help of summer assignments and projects while other knowledge rushes away through time. Summer assignments should be designed by the teachers so that it is beneficial information being absorbed by the student, the work is thorough and stretches the mind of the student, and allows the student to stay in the know with the right information without it being to overwhelming with having to design their own project.",5,Summer projects,Independent
AEBB0D1C98E9,"Picture yourself in the middle of summer break with no knowledge of how to start your summer project that is due at the beginning of the next school year. Several schools require students to do a summer project so that they can continue learning, even when they are not in school. Normally, the assignment will be created by the teacher for the student to accomplish over the break. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because it will be easier for the teacher to grade, the teacher-designed projects will benefit the student's character, and it will help the students be prepared academically for the next school year.

To begin, teacher-designed summer projects would create easier and more efficient grading. After a long break from school, grading projects with no outline would not be the first thing a teacher would want to do when coming back from summer. If students are given a specific project to do, it would be much easier for the teacher to grade and understand, especially when they designed it. It would also benefit the student by giving them an outline of what they need to do and how to execute it properly.

Teachers around the world are looking for ways to improve their teaching. Also, teachers are looking for ways that are more efficient for both the teacher and the student. Projects for students over the summer would help them work on that. Teachers should create summer projects in order to make grading easier and more accurate.

Secondly, summer projects designed by teachers will benefit a student's character. There will be a level of responsibility that will need to be reached by students. The teacher-designed projects will advance them further in knowledge, obedience, and responsibility. Research has shown that schools that do summer projects as a requirement have had an increase in higher grades and basic life skills. Since they will not have to create their own assignment, the students will learn how to accept things that they might not want to. Outside of teaching academic skills, this would benefit the student by teaching them life skills as well. Summer projects should be created by teachers so that the a student's character can grow.

Thirdly, teacher-designed summer projects will give the students preparation and a better knowledge of the classes that they will take the following school year. They will understand what the expectations are, who the teacher is, and how the class is handled. For example, if there is a book project a student needs to complete for an English class that they will take the following year, they will not understand what the levels of expectations are or how to do it properly. With a project designed by the teacher, the student will be able to fully comprehend what the teacher expects and what they need to do in order to finish the project efficiently. Also, students will be able to experience what the class will be like the following year. It will get them ready for the school year and keep their brains functioning throughout the summer break. Summer projects should be created by teachers so that students will be academically ready for the next school year and classes.

Some may say that a student-designed project would be better because it gives the student more freedom and independence to decide. However, it would be hard for the teacher to grade a project with no boundaries. It would cause a carefree attitude for the student, and this would create no expectations, a lack of hard work, and grading struggles for the teacher. Although the teacher-designed project might not interest the student as much, it would give the student a boundary and knowledge of what they are to do.

In conclusion, summer projects should be created by teachers because the projects will be easier and more efficient for the teacher to grade, it will help continue the growth of a student's character, and the student will be fully prepared for the next school year. Not only will students benefit from this, but teachers will as well. Therefore, teachers should create projects to better the next generation of young adults. Students that support this should go to their administration and let them know that teacher-designed projects would overall benefit schools, their students, and future communities. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
D6B4B647FC25,"You ever get a project that you have to do and you never know where to start? School's ending, you and your best mates are talking to each other, deciding what to do in the summer and finally relinquishing the fact that you've made through the school year again. However, there's always that pesky thing that you fear most, school work during summer break. Maybe it's beneficial to you, and they want to make sure you aren't behind in a class or fail next year. But what kind of project is it, is it a do it yourself or a ""do it yourself""? So you're naturally stuck, sitting there at your desk, thinking about how to get this over with so your mom can turn back on the internet to your room. Or so you think, you wouldn't have to be, if your teacher told you what to do, and you finish it without a second thought and it's off until the cows come home. Summer projects should be teacher designed due to most students not wanting any work over break, students might get huge amounts of stress, and students can take less time finishing it.

Rarely students want work over the break, most don't want to think about school work. Yes, work is work and you still have to finish it because school, but no kid wants to think about work during their own break. If it were teacher designed, at least they have some sort of guideline to follow so they just have to use a little bit of their brain. For example, if it were teacher designed, students can look what at they have to do, finish it, and go hang out with their friends. If it were student designed, students would have to think about what they have to do, finish it, and by the time they're done, summer is over. No one wants to have that happen to them, because they want to enjoy themselves and save the project for maybe near the end of the summer.

Stress, something that comes naturally, and something you should not obtain from an outside source. If students have to do their own project, their stress goes up by a lot. When students go out during their break, let's say to the mall or something, they have to remember in the back of their head that they have that project to stress over about. Stress is still going to be there whether or not it's student-designed or teacher-designed, but at least with teacher-designed, it would be a lesser amount of stress unlike if it were student-designed. For example, if students were out hanging with each other, then one realizes they have to go home and finish their project. They get home, pull out their project and if it were student-designed, they'd be stuck there all day, worrying about the project, which adds to more stress. If it were teacher-designed, students would finish in a heartbeat and go back to hanging out with their friends, because students don't have to know what to do, because the teacher told them, what to do.

Time, a very limited resource that you either waste, or spend wisely. It is not something you should be spending on thinking about a project. Both teacher-designed and student-designed take time, teacher-designed just takes less time. You could very well spend that time on doing what you want to do with your time, not something you don't want to do with your time. For example, if the project were teacher-designed, you can finish it whenever you want to finish it and it'd take less time, if it were student-designed you would have to think about it more, which takes more time, so you wouldn't be able to do a good job on it if it were at the end of summer break. Whenever I receive a project, I always say ""why do I have to do this,"" if it were student-designed. If it were teacher-designed, I'd say ""Oh, a project, well at least I have something to follow,"" Also with student-designed, no examples, so more time wasted trying to figure out what to do.

So you finally finish your project, but at what cost? The amount of more work you had to do, the amount of more stress added, or the amount of more time wasted? At least if it were teacher-designed, you can get rid of those mores and it'd just be a negligible amount. So why waste extra time when summer break should be time to yourself, and why worry about thinking on what you should do, when your teacher already thought out for you? Don't waste yourself worrying about some project that you have only yourself to rely on, have a project that's already thought out for you, you just have to finish it.",5,Summer projects,Independent
E40FC88896CF,"Imagine having to complete a project over summer break. Sounds miserable, right? Now think about a project designed by you, for you. I believe that summer projects should be designed by students because it would be in their best interest, would allow them to be more creative and give the teachers a glimpse at their students potential. Many teachers assign projects that no student wants to do over the break, but if the students were to design the projects it would make them more eager to complete the assignment given.

The first reason why I believe students should design their own summer projects is their interest. Teachers often give projects on subjects that their students usually don't find interesting. This results in sloppy, unfinished, careless work that might not even meet the criterion required. The reason behind this is because the students doesn't care about what they're learning. Now if the teachers were to tailor projects to things that students find interesting they would put more effort into what they are doing instead of thinking, ""whats the least amount of work I can do to get an A on this project"". Some people say that students being lazy is the reason why they don't put effort into their work, however they;re wrong because the teacher is supposed to make learning interesting so that students want to learn.

Many students have hobbies and things they enjoy doing. If projects were designed around their hobbies and interests than it would provoke them to do better work. When a teacher sets a template for a project or any assignment this puts a leash on the students and hinders their creative ideas. What teachers also don't realize is that some students use the template to their advantage by completing the bare minimum amount of work. For example, if you're told to have a project with five facts about the solar system you could use basic facts like,""Earth has one moon"" and it would be an acceptable answer. The amount of work that the student has to do becomes way easier because of the template the teacher provided. One great way to make kids be more creative is tell them,""teach it like you've never heard of it before"". For example, if you were told to teach a class for beginners about computer coding pretend you're teaching it to someone who has never heard of a computer before. If a student were to design a project for another student it would be more free form and allow for a plethora of different ideas and make for some amazing projects. Some people may say that students could choose a topic that is too easy or not related to the learning in class, however they are wrong because the teacher can provide confirmation to make sure the project is relevant and difficult enough.

My final reason why students should design their own projects is potential. Students are given a formula approach to learning where there's only one way to get things right and that's by using the formula provided by the teachers. This greatly limits and prevents development of potential. One person said,""schools don't teach us about money because they're training us to be employees and not managers and CEO s"", and I believe that teaching students and project format are to blame. Teachers should let their students loose for their summer projects. When the sky is the limit students love to go above and beyond. These projects would be designed by students without help from teachers. Now with assistance from their teachers they could correct things that the student got wrong, which would boost potential instead of hindering it. Nurturing and supporting students would boost their confidence and hopefully make them strive to do even better with their work.

In conclusion summer projects should be something that students want to do over the summer instead of moping and completing last minute because they would be more interested, more creative and would allow for teachers to catch a glimpse at student potential. The job of a teacher is to help students learn and grow and if they provide assistance, support and corrections of student ideas and project design i'm positive that students would enjoy designing and completing their own projects over the summer.",5,Summer projects,Independent
2272E232DFD6,"Many teachers offer summer projects to ensure that their students will be productive over their break. There has been a lot of controversy on if students should be the ones to create the summer assignments or if teachers should create them. Summer projects can be a great benefit for students next years in school, with this said teachers should be the ones to make the summer projects because, they have more knowledge on the information they hand out and it would make it easier for them to grade. Having teachers make the summer assignments not only benefits the teacher but it also benefits the student.

Summer projects are important to have, it would be best if they were created by someone who would have a lot of knowledge on the topic of the project, which would be a teacher. If students were to create the projects they wouldn't know what to make it about, students arent as educated as teachers are. Teachers have the benefit of the doubt because they know what they need their students to learn. A project wouldn't be very helpful if it was made by someone who didn't know much about what the project was on. Having experience and knowledge with a topic is very important when it comes to making a project.

Summer projects should be created by teachers because they have more knowledge and its easier for teachers to grade then students. Grades are very important to many students lives and they will do anything to see a ""A"" on there report card. With this said students shouldn't be the ones to create their summer assignments because, they would make it really easy just to get a good grade. Summer projects shouldn't be made just to get a good grade, they should be made to help you understand and remember the things you learned from the past year. Having teachers create summer projects is the best option because they wouldn't make it easy just so the class could get a good grade, they would make it so it benefit each of the students. This would also benefit the teacher because it would make it easier for them to grade each project since they made the project themselves and understand the topic.

With all of the different controversy on if students should be the ones who make the summer projects or if teachers should be the one, teachers are the best choice. Teachers do have a lot of good evidence to why they should be the project designers but, students wouldnt be a bad option either. Students have a bunch of free time over the summer compared to teachers where they might take on another job and be busy with that. With students having a bunch of free time over their summer break they can have more time to make and work on their summer projects. If summer assignments were created by the student it could benefit the student more because, they know what they need to still learn or review. Although, students have good reasons to why they should be the projects designers, teachers are still the best fit for the position.

Some schools require summer assignments and some schools don't but if there was a option if students should create the assignments of if teachers should, teachers would be the best choice. Teachers have the most knowledge on the topics they want to teach and they would be able to grade more efficient. Summer projects are meant to be beneficial to not only the student but to the teachers too. With teachers being the project designer they can make sure the project is high quality with information that will benefit each student. Therefore, summer projects should be made by teachers. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
52145F7349A8,"The summer time is a time of relaxation and enjoyment for school students. Projects take up free time and when the teacher makes a project the students feel forced to complete it. When a students gets to choose the project at hand they will feel less forced, less stressed, and less like the school takes up the summer. Teachers should not choose the project for the summer.

Deciding what a student has to do a project on makes them feel forced. A student feels that there is nothing they can do until the project is completed. When the students get to pick a project there is a feeling of freedom. The choice is not forced; therefore, students feel more at ease with the project. Not only does the project feel forced, a chosen project can put extra stress on a student.

Students may already feel stressed in school, so why add onto the stress over the summer? A teacher chosen project adds stress to a summer that should feel relaxed. A student that picks their own project can lessen the stress from schools. Students do not have to feel that a project is the only thing to do for summer break. Stress can ruin a summer break and also cause the student to possibly not do as well as they would if they could pick their own project. Students may also feel forced to do the project.

Feeling forced to do a project can destroy a summer break. The only thing that students may feel they can do is the project. When teaches pick the project the students feel they have to complete it or they will fail the class. When this happens it takes all the fun from a summer break away. Students parents may also tell them that the project needs to be done before they can do anything. Feeling forced to do anything can make performance very bad.

In conclusion, when a project is required over the summer; the students should get the choice. Choosing the project can make it feel less forced onto the students, lower stress from school, and stop school from taking up the summer. Teachers should not choose the project for students. Students will feel better when the project is their choice. This will make all the students feel better for picking their own project.",4,Summer projects,Independent
9C95AF195D21,"Summer projects are an activity that every student dreads. These projects are a common practice by schools to prepare students for the upcoming school year. Many schools debate whether summer-projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects need to be student-designed because it helps students retain forgotten information, allows students to prepare for the upcoming school year, and it keeps students busy throughout the summer.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to retain forgotten information from the previous school year. Subjects including math or science require concepts to be retained because they build off of each other. For example, it is required for students to remember Algebra 1 to succeed in Algebra 2. This sets up students for success so they are not lost when they enter the school year. Going along with that, teachers don't always have enough time in the year to go over forgotten concepts. A lot of school subjects go at a fast pace and have a lot of content to go over. This doesn't allow teachers to go over concepts from prior years. Making school projects student-designed will set up students for success because they have that prior knowledge to build off. When students retain information from the previous year, it gives them confidence when tackling new concepts. Schools try their best to give students confidence so they can perform to the best of their abilities. Their confidence can be damaged when they don't remember concepts from the previous year which goes into learning new subjects. This hinders their ability to succeed in school. Making summer projects student-designed will help them remember past concepts, which will increase student confidence during the school year.

Going along with that, making summer projects student-designed will give them an idea about the skills they need to know for the next school year. Before students enter a class, they may feel anxious about the difficulty of the class. Students may not necessarily know what a specific class is expecting from them. Making summer projects student-designed will give students an idea about the expectations of a particular class. This will reduce the anxiety faced by students because they already have an idea about the kind of work assigned in that class. Students will also get a head start on concepts learned for the next school year. When students enter school, they won't be confused when they start to learn because they already had practice on these concepts on the summer project. This makes academics much easier for students and allows them to have an understand even before the upcoming school year. Furthermore, if students are prepared for concepts learned for the next school year, it will remove the negative connotation that students have with school. Students often don't like school because it is challenging or they do not understand what is being taught. If schools assigned a summer project to students, it will help students think positively about school. This will allow students to enjoy the subject they are learning because they will not be lost trying to grasp the new concepts.

Allowing summer projects to be student-designed will keep students busy throughout the summer. Students often face laziness and boredom throughout the summer because they have no work to do. Making summer projects student-designed will prevent students from laziness and actually give them something to do. Keeping students busy during the summer will give them a better transition into the school year. Often, students are not prepared to work again due to having three months off. This makes the transition into school difficult for students because they are used to having that time off. If school projects were student-based, students would have an easier transition into school because they would already be used to working during the summer. Keeping students busy during the summer will benefit their work habits when entering the school year. Furthermore, keeping students busy with summer projects will keep their brains working. It is important that students brains are still active throughout the summer so they can be mentally prepared for the next school year. It is important for students to stay busy throughout the summer so skills such a problem solving aren't lost. Skills such as problem solving are important for student because it not only helps them in school, but in their personal lives as well. Students need to get used to staying busy in the summer because it will prepare them for a real world job. Students need to keep their brains engaged, which is why making summer projects student-based will keep them physically and mentally active.

Remembering information from previous school years, learning concepts for the upcoming school year, and keeping students busy are all valid arguments as to why summer projects should be student-designed. Making school projects teacher-designed will not benefit students in any way because they will not have the experience necessary to succeed in the upcoming school year. Teachers are already trained on how to teach so it would be unnecessary for them to be teacher-based. Going along with that, students need to realize that summer projects are not a punishment. Their purpose is so students understand concepts for the next school year and help them develop into successful citizens. Later in life, students will thank schools for these projects because it will provide students the necessary resources to live a beneficial life.",6,Summer projects,Independent
D1AC5052EF9B,"My grandfather would always say ""creativity is done by the person on what they decide to do, not what others want them to do."" The summer projects should be student-designed. One can use their imagination, and one can never know what amazing and jaw dropping projects the student might come up with. If a student is forced to make a project that the teacher designed, one might be limited on what they could create. Summer projects should student orientated; they could be creative and not be so limited.

Firstly, student might find it difficult to be creative if the project is teacher-designed. Students might see it as boring project and might not even do it, or might come out very uninteresting for others. For instance, a friend of mine made project for science and the students got to chose what to do. He created a sword, in which only works on specific people, can enable a person to drain or give someones energy or make them weak. It was incredible and something a scientist or any other person would dream of existing. One could see the other side and having the project being teacher orientated. Maybe it would make it easier to grade. A student from a different class made a volcano for his science class because the teacher told them to make one, and it was good but very unoriginal and used a lot. One can unlock a lot from their brains, if one isn't made to do something their not interested in.

Consequently, the projects from the student might not be as fascinating. Student would probably find it stressful because their might be limitation on what they can create. Most of the student, find it irritating, if a project is designed by the teacher. A lot of them might even over think it. For example, a senior last year had a summer project and it was teacher-designed project. He was struggling on it and he said "" I do not have the freedom to make what I want and I feel restricted."" At the end, he ended up not doing it and his grade dropped massively. Teachers need let student express them selves and let the students be free.

Morale of the story, teacher-designed projects are not a good idea. All the student creativity would be locked and the project might end up boring and unoriginal. Students might over think it and not do it, consequently will impact their grade. The student need to be free and express them selves. Having limitations would most likely result in the student struggling and stressing out.",4,Summer projects,Independent
302DC21A6DEE,"Have you ever been in a situation where you were excited to start a project but found out it was designed by your teacher who is very uncreative, because I have! Summer projects should be student-designed because students can embrace their creativity and can also be a great chance to learn how to complete things on their own. There was a time when my class had to complete a project that was teacher-designed, which dis-encouraged students to even start the project because the teachers choice of design was not creative, but more basic and boring. When students have the opportunity to create something, they really tend to express themselves more and may even be delighted to complete the task. This shows that when teachers assign something that was created with their own personal ideas and designs, it can really take away the great experience students have when they create something with their own ideas.

Some people may say teachers should be the only ones to design things for students for a better learning experience, however they are wrong because students will never get anywhere in life when things are half way completed for them. Recalling the well known phrase ""getting hand fed will get you nowhere"", students should always have the opportunity to do things on their own because they can get the chance to learn and grow from their own mistakes. When teachers actually give the students an opportunity to do something on their own, they may seek guidance but you shouldn't try to wage your opinions and overpower their own ideas. These summer projects should always be student-designed and these are my reasonings.",3,Summer projects,Independent
BC14D201CBF5,"Summer Projects should never be student-designed, strictly teacher-designed. Many students wouldnt be able to teach themselves or even complete their own projects. Especially during summer, school is fresh out and for awhile. No student would wanna actually take their time and effort to work on a school project when school's out. Majority of students would be focused on having fun, as well as being on vacation.

First, students will be focused on having fun and enjoying their vacation. Also, summer itself is a vacation for the students, they dont see it as a time to be working on ""school"" projects when school is out. They'll usually find it pointless and a bother to be worrying about a project while it's summer. Which is a main reason on why if any summer projects are given, they should be teacher-designed. Many students wouldnt be able to be trusted with such a task, also depending on their grade level.

Therefore, all projects given out strictly over summer, should be teacher-designed. Students cant teach theirselves something they haven't learned. That's the whole point of the role and title of a teacher, to help the students they oversee. It could work like, teachers giving one final lesson at the end of the year and they assign a project with the information they had just taught. The information taught should have some sort of follow up into their next class for the school year after that summer.

Lastly, even if the projects handed out over summer are teacher-designed, there will still be a small amount of students who dont bother with it. It's a difficult thing to complete and follow through with, nobody wants to have to do a summer project. That small amount of students who dont complete the project, usually are the ones who are the less educated students. Of course the students who do complete the summer project will be the same ones that prosper in life, that small amount of students who dont complete the project usually sink more and more over the years. No matter what that small amount of students cant really be helped or changed, it's more of a work ethic to complete a summer project.

In conclusion, most students will be focused on enjoying their summer vacation and having fun, which means giving out a summer project will be a problem for most. It isn't like nobody will complete it, it;s just something nobody wants to volunteer to do. Which makes teacher-designed projects the better option compared to student-designed. There will definitely be a small amount of students who wont complete the project, its not something that can be typically helped. As said before it's usually the person work ethic, which can conclude with an unfinished project. Also, any given project over summer should be related or relevant to the students upcoming year class.",4,Summer projects,Independent
9CD49AB8E6A4,"Summer projects are a good way for students to learn and retain information for the upcoming school year. It lets the teachers know that the students took the time out of their summer and learn material. Summer projects are usually teacher-designed however, I believe that student-designed projects are more beneficial. By letting students design their own projects the student will have better time management, skill set, and self-esteem.

To begin with, if a student were to designed their own projects they would have better time management. In order for the project to be beneficial, the students will have to prepare everything. For example, if I was given an assignment by a teacher, I would wait until the last minute to complete it. However, if I had to design my own project I will have to do it on a time schedule. When a student is required to design something, they will take their time to make sure everything is right. That is not the case if they wait last minute. If a student designed something they want everything to be perfect and presentable. When a student has better time management, they will be able to improve their skills.

Letting students design their own projects will allow them to sharpen their own skills. I believe that if students are allowed to design their own project, they would learn more. The students will have to take the time to do the research on the topic before completing the task. They would learn from their mistakes and try to understand where they went wrong to fix it. Also, if a student were to design their own project they would be able to think outside the box and enhance their knowledge on the topic. For instance, if a student were to design a project about Generic_City, they would be able to do an in-depth research about it and learn more than if a teacher were to gather questions from an online textbook. The student will also improve organizational skills. By organizing the project they would put more time and effort into it to make sure everything is correct. When a student has organized their project, complete it, and have a better understanding, they would have a higher self-esteem.

When a student has a better understanding on a topic, their self-esteem will improve. The student would be able to appreciate the hard work I have done to get me to where I am a. If a student did not have a grasp on the topic before, but now have an understanding, their confidence will be boosted. For example, if I was to be asked if I understand triangles in eleventh grade the first time we learned it I would not be confident in myself. However, if I took the time during the summer and do research on it and finally grasp the concept, I would be more confident when it is time to take quizzes and tests. Consequently, if a student is not really confident on a topic they might have a negative attitude on the matter. They might have a fixed mindset and think that if they did not get it the first time, they will not get it the second time. By having a fixed mindset, the student will probably not care and avoid the subject. However, if a student truly wants to get better they will grow out of that mindset and learn.

All in all, students that designs their own projects are receiving more benefits. The student's time management will be better. They would have expanded and improved their knowledge on topics. Also they will have better confidence when doing something. When the students come back from break they will be ready to go the old material and learn new material. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
BE1367FA4958,"Why Summer Projects Should be Designed by Teachers

Summer projects are given out to students for the purpose of learning and devolping over their break. Teachers take the responsibily of making sure their students are well informed and understand the concept of their project before they go. That being said, teacher-designed projects are more likey to have a better affect on students becasue of their expirience on the project in the past and supirior knowledge. Not only would this help students achieve more succesful results when they return, but also give them better knowledge about their project.

One example would be that if teachers have delt with the project before, they must already have a better understanding on what's expected from the students if he/she wants them to continue with their learning. Teachers with experience can also help students by providing them with different examples about past projects, so they can see for themselves on how to perform and accomplish it. This can as well benefit the students on having positive results and feedback when they return. Furthermore, teachers know that nothing new is being shown since they've designed and handled with the project before. Meaning, this will make their job eaier to expalin and assist those who need it.

Another example would be the amount of knowledge the teacher has and provies to their students which can be put for good use when designing the project. They know what their students have learned and the things they've haven't. Gathering all of that information from what they've taught and shown throughtout the school year into one summer project, would make an excellent assignment for thier students to get the best high-learning quality. Teachers designing projects could also mean expecting higher outcomes on their learning skills and standards. As as well as, better opportunities for thier students to learn something they can hold onto for the rest of their lives that could perhaps be very valuable.

With all this being said, student-designed summer projects simply wont give the most learning performance out of a student then to a project designed by a teacher. While they might sound easier for the student to do, they don't know as much as a teacher would. Teacher-designed projects get in depth about the purpose of the lesson and what the student should get out of if it. Meant to give the student the most reliable information and tasks he/she won't forgot during the summer. Specifically designed by his/her own teacher who knows what their strengths and weeknesses have been during the school year. In hopes to create something that'll continue on with their learning.",4,Summer projects,Independent
E827A459B025,"Many schools have considered requiring students to complete projects over the summer break. If required, should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? In my opinion, teacher-designed projects seems like the best interest for students. When students design these projects, they would probably make them very simple and boring, just to get out of work. Projects created by students will probably not be appropriate at school. Also, student-designed projects will not be taken serious by the students. However, individuals may have different opinions on this topic.

When assigned a summer project, teachers should design the project and tell what to do. If students design these projects, they would be very simple and boring, just to get out of doing a lot of work. Students think if they get it over with, they can do what they want the rest of the summer. The purpose of the summer project is to continue learning during the break. Students may do the minimum, which is not learning much over break. Some individuals may say it would also be simple when a teacher assigns it, because every student will be doing the same project, but if the teacher assigns the project at least they will know what the project is. Therefore, there are many other reasons why teachers should assign all summer projects.

Projects over summer are to assure that students learn over the long break. Letting students design their own project, leads to the project not being appropriate at school. Not being appropriate at schools means not educational for school purposes. If the project, is not educational, why design it for school? Many students may think, ""they want me to do a project, fine I'll do whatever comes to mind first."" Most people say the students did the project, it did not have to be educational. If the project is not educational, there is no purpose to design it for school. Continuing learning over break is supposed to be related to educational purposes and not just doing a project for fun.

Student-designed projects will not be taken serious by the students, themselves. If the teacher assigns a summer project, the student will be required to do it, but if the student is allowed to design a project, they will wait until the last day of summer to do it. The students will come up with a project in one day, then do it, and forget about it for the rest of the summer. Some say that students may not take teacher-designed projects seriously either. That is true, but they may also feel obligated to do the project if the teacher designs and assigns it. On the other hand, I think teachers should design all summer projects for many reasons.

In conclusion, when designing a summer project for students, the teacher should be in charge of designing the project. Students should not be allowed to design their own, because it will be simple and boring, just to get out of doing work. Summer projects created by students and not by teachers may not be appropriate at school. Also, student-designed summer projects will not be taken serious by the students. So, if your school is considering summer projects and you agree with the statements above, talk to the principle and go to the school board with these ideas. Let your principle know that teacher-designed summer projects is in the best interest of the student. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
458D4C5C5727,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, and are either designed by their teacher, or designed by the students. In my opinion, these projects should be designed by the teacher. I believe this because teachers are more likely to have more knowledge about the next level of learning than the students would know, and therefore, would be able to put better information that would most likely to be more effective for the student as they move on. Also, the teacher would know better about how much work each individual student needs to have and what their limits are as well. Students could also reach out to their teachers in case the students summer plans would get in the way of their summer project, allowing teachers to know how much the amount of work should be given out to the students so they can both work, and get some r and r. Finally, teacher-designed projects would be most likely be very similar to each other and would be easier to grade for the next teacher, and allow students to recieve assistance from other students in case their teacher is not available for help.

The first reason why summer assignments should be designed by the teacher is that the teacher usually knows more about the upcoming classes the student will have to take when the summer is over and school starts up again than the student would. The teacher would be able to select the topics for the summer assignment the students would need to know in order to get ready and be prepared for the next grade. In case they do not know what to do, most students would have to take time out of their day to find out about what they will be learning about in the next school year if they are designing the summer project by themselves, and that time could have been easily used to be working on their summer assignment.

Another reason why summer assignments should be designed by the teacher is that the teacher would be able to know what each individual student can and cannot do, and will be able to give out the most appropriate amount of work needed for each student so the student can succeed. Since every individual is different and learns at different speeds and learns things differently, this will allow students to be able to learn incredibly well and be prepared at their own pace.

In case summer plans would get in the way of the students summer projects, they should be able to get in touch with their teacher and learn what they could do to get the project done on time. This could involve less work or maybe a different assignment than what they first received to fit what the students summer plans will be. This allows for students to get a healthy amount of work in the summer while getting rest and doing summer activities.

My final reason on why teacher-designed summer projects would be better than if the students designed them, is that teacher assigned projects could be similar to each student and would be less difficult to grade. Also, it would allow students to recieve help from other students that would help them succeed.

This concludes my essay whether summer projects would be better if they were designed by students, or made by the teachers, I believe that if teachers designed them, it would allow a more fitting learning experience, better information on what students should know, and the amount of work that is needed for each student.",4,Summer projects,Independent
A801F239BB74,"Schools assign summer projects or assignments to ensure that the student continues to learn and develop the necessary skills to not just grow, but thrive in the classes they're taking the next school year. I believe that it is the teacher's responsibility to create and structure the assignments to cover all of the basic skills and knowledge that the student needs to have mastered to start the class with their best foot forward. The teacher knows what the student needs to be able to learn in their class and has a much better idea of how to design a project or make sure material is absorbed by the student.

Since the teacher is familiar with the content of their class it is rather easy for them to design a project or assignment for a student to work on that pertains to their class. However, a student may have a difficult time trying to teach them self all of the material that they should know to start the year, and it can even be troublesome to know what you actually need to cover without the teacher's guidance. For example; if a student were to design a project for a biology class that they would take the next year in school, it would be completely possible for them to miss the mark on the information the teacher was hoping that they'd cover. It makes much more sense for the teacher to create the project them self; although, giving the student a guideline on something like a research project in which they would learn all of the topics the teacher wishes them to cover during the summer is a great idea. In a sense, having the student designing their own project while following a rubric or a set list of required topics would be the most efficient way of doing summer assignments.

The purpose of a summer assignment is to ensure that the student retains the information and is going into the class with a background knowledge that serves as a good foundation for the information that they'll learn during the course. The best way for this to be done is having the teacher design the assignment because of their experience with teaching and their retrospect on how other students did after changes made to previous summer assignments. The student is likely to put in minimal effort into the assignment if they have to create it completely on their own because of how stressful and boring it can seem during the summer. When the teacher makes the assignment most of the students will complete the assignment on a schedule, and by doing this they actually create a stronger foundation of that knowledge because of the length of the time period that they're thinking about the topic. However, a student created assignment will be much shorter and not cover all of the material very well because they aren't sure what should be included. The best solution is allowing the student to learn and teach them self independently at least partially, and giving guidance and structure for another part of the assignment.

Teachers will argue that a teacher designed assignment is the better option because of their expertise, but students will argue that because they don't know the material they should design the assignment themselves. The student's argument would include points like: an argument about independence, a persuasion that teaching themselves is beneficial to their learning, and it can be less stressful when designing it themselves because they can control the length, difficulty, and information covered. Although these are valid points, I still would believe that because without teacher guidance the student wouldn't know what material to cover the student's argument is flawed. The independence is earned by studying, they get the benefit of learning at their pace when studying before and during the course, and some stress is relieved when the teacher lays out a plan for the student to complete.

The debate on whether the teacher or the student should design the summer assignment for their class is an easy argument to take a side on. The teacher is clearly the better choice because of their expertise in teaching and their ability to ensure that the student retains the information is invaluable to the efficiency of the assignment. Giving students the time to teach themselves some of the information is a good idea, but most of the instruction should be led by the teacher so that they cover everything they need to and don't get off track. Although the student's argument does make a point about the level of stress involved, but it doesn't carry as much weight as the benefit of covering everything the techer wants the student to and creating that strong foundation of knowledge for the class.",6,Summer projects,Independent
99EBD3D71311,"Summer projects are often seen by the student populous as a scourge upon their lives, more work to procrastinate on. To teachers, however, they are a tool which students can use in order to stay on track with their education and keep up-to-date information with. As painful as they seem, these projects are created with a significant goal in mind: teaching accurately and consistently. Although student-designed summer projects are often more in-touch with other students, teacher-designed summer projects are tailored to the expectations of discipline and knowledge held for their students.

To start, teacher-designed summer curricula enable the student to learn and apply their knowledge suited to the general teaching style. Over the summer, it's difficult for many students to stay on track with their learning, and it's very easy for them to drift away from their usual learning. Staying on-track is essential for students with good expectations and high goals; these projects can be designed to accomplish this, without any rough beginnings once the semester starts. In calculus, my teacher has very high expectations for his students. Every one of us received a ""summertime fun packet"" to work through over the summer, and it prepped us for the year that was to come: the first day of school, he jumped right into action and lectured to us as if it were the day before the AP exam. Because of his summer assignment's intuitive design, most students were prepared for this behavior, and could take thorough notes on the subject, further proving that teacher-designed projects are more useful to the hardworking student.

Another reason that teacher-designed summer projects are superior is that they are tailored to the unique curriculum the student will be taught with. Any good teacher can deviate from the standard curriculum throughout their teaching, and an assignment on par with the syllabus prepares the student for this ""improvisation."" For instance, my literature teacher assigned us questions analyzing a book we had read in the year, preparing our brains for the material we would be seeing in the year. Although the curriculum calls for practice in rhetorical analysis, it does not discuss proper thesis writing: our instructor assigned us work for both of these. Every dedicated student in the class was not only prepared for the work we were given, but we were confident in our abilities to accomplish these assignments. On account of the deep analysis questions my teacher assigned to me over the summer, I was more able to excel in my work in language and literature, further driving me to learn more and become more accomplished in my English classes.

Finally, teacher-designed summer projects are better for the student because a teacher has considerably more years of experience both learning and teaching effectively. Generic_Name taught us to hold mutual respect between student and teacher; in the best of classes, this respect is still exercised and encouraged to make learning as enriching and impactful as possible. With this in mind, the teacher is also more likely to be accurately designing their projects to reasonable expectations for the student, and to make summer assignments as practical as possible. Teachers are constantly informed on new teaching strategies and the most effective ways for students to apply themselves, and it's their job to make use of this in order to prepare their students for their futures. Alongside personal experience and intuitive training, the teacher is in a much less biased position to be creating work, without personal incentives to lighten the workload or to cut corners in their answers. All things considered, the experience a teacher has in preparing students for class is the most valuable quality they hold when it comes to your workload, far outweighing the experience of a busy student.

In conclusion, a teacher is undoubtedly the best person to be designing summer projects. The teacher's abilities to tailor their assignments consistent with their teaching style, to prepare the student according to the curriculum they are taught with, and to teach according to their own class experiences enable the most practical and effective work a student can receive. It's very important that summer assignments reflect what a teacher produces in their class. Without this preparation, valuable classtime that could be used to frontload the curriculum is lost, and a student will not get enough out of their education as they require to achieve their highest goals.",6,Summer projects,Independent
12156BA6D875,"Summer porjects should be designed by the students because the students would make it better to understand, teachers would give us boring projects and we need the mental break in the summer, and students get summer jobs so they need to focus on that.

Not all students understand a project the same, some need extra help understanding the project, everyone has a different mindset. Students would make the project at their own pace, others would make the project fun and not a long and boring one, since its summer it should all be about doing fun things, they would actually understand it since its their own, and they wouldn't hate it as much.

After a long school year students need a break from all of the studying and work they been doing in school, some students have stress from all of the projects that the teachers leave them and they would appreciate to do a project of their own and not a boring project, some others may suffer from anxiety which means a painful or fearful uneasiness of mind usually over an impending or anticipated event,other students might actually enjoy doing a project for once since its their own.

Students usually get summer jobs, since they want to make money of their own since they can't becasue they are busy with school. While doing their project they would bring stuff from their work depending where they work at, and since its theirs they wouldn't have to work hard and maily focuse in makijng the money they need, they may be working to save up money for college since its extremely expensive or help their parents pay the bills its good to start paying bills at a young age.

This is why students should make their summer projects and not the teachers because the students would make it better to understand, teachers would give us boring projects and we need the mental break in the summer, and students get summer jobs so they need to focus on that and to be honest majority of the students aren't going to do the project regardless if they make it or if the teachers make it since its summer.",3,Summer projects,Independent
7E8A1EA544E0,"What is a summer project? A summer project is self explanatory. It is a project that is made by students teachers in some schools with the purpose of making sure students continue learning throughout their summer break. When given a summer project who should be the one designing it? Would it be best for the project to be designed by the teachers, who know what is the most important material for students, or by a student, who knows what material is already known to them? Making these decisions may be something difficult to decide on. I believe that summer projects should be student and teacher-designed.

The main reason as to why I believe the projects should be both student and teacher-designed is because in the eyes of the teacher they might believe a subject is difficult and could be easily forgotten but to the students it could be the easiest subject that they have learned. The student could be stuck on a subject that the teacher found to be the easiest one out of them all. This way if both, the teacher and the student work together on designing the project it could benefit the student in the future school year. This process may take more time than it would if it was just the teacher designing it but it is more secure.

Another reason as to why it would be best for the projects to be student and teacher-designed is because of the time it may take. If teachers would be doing them alone they would have to be looking back and forth on what each individual student needs to improve in. On the other case if students help out it would be less time they spend because the students will be explaining to the teacher what they do not understand or the subjects that they struggle in.

If the students were to design their projects on their own there is high chance that they would choose the subjects that they understand. Most students would take advantage of their opportunity on to get an easy A on the project. Let's be honest how many students do you think would willingly be working on a project for school over the summer rather than hanging out with friends or being on their phones. Students don't want to be spending the only real time they have out of school just to be working on school work, they will attempt to make it easy on themselves.

In conclusion the best option for designing school projects is the teachers and their students. In a way students wouldn't be able to copy off of each other because not everyone struggles in the same subjects.",4,Summer projects,Independent
7DB352480689,"Summer projects should be designed by students, summer time is supposed to be a time where students can relax and not worry about school work. If a teacher decides to give a project in summer break the least they could do is let the students design it, they will know how much can they handle at a time and still learn. Each student is different they learn at their own pace.

One reason why I believe students should design their own Summer projects is because they are gonna be motivated to do it. Teacher made projects can be super complicated and the directions given can also be complicated, if students are given the opportunity to design their own project and make directions they can understand they will take time out of their day to do it because because they have confidence in themselves and know what they are doing.

When teachers give directions on a Summer project and give packets explaining what to do, from a students perspective, when they know summer is around they won't be paying attention in school anymore especially if it's the last month or last few weeks left and when summer does start they will lose track of the packet and directions that were given to them. It's different when someone gives you directions one month before summer starts and expect you to remember it but if they are not focused about school anymore how do expect them to remember a summer assignment. They are more worried more about what they are gonna do over the summer when school ends, but if a student makes the directions themselves and the project they are more likely to remember it because they know how it should be done and the expectations are made by them so that when they don't complete it they don't have anyone to but themselves.

I can also understand the teachers perspective, they want the kids to learn more over the summer and be prepared for the next year so they assign projects that will help them and expect it to be finished. They want to help the students meet their goals and expect them to set high expectations for themselves, but when a student realizes the work given over the summer is just like any other classwork they will set it aside. If teachers are able to make a project that is fun and can be beneficial to learning, teenagers or kids will do it and will be more prepared when the next year comes.

Overall I believe Summer projects should be designed by students, summer for students is their time to relax and have fun, but when a teacher assigns a summer assignment students most likely do not do it or keep procrastinating and pushing it back. If the students make it themselves and make it beneficial and fun they will take time out of their day to do it. That's why it's important for teachers to understand how students function, they won't respond to boring assignments, you have to make something that students are actually interested in learning. If you are unable to do that let the students make it themselves. When students design their own projects they know what they want and what they are interested in to learn.

B9BB6A0E2F04,"Students learn better if they are interested in what they are being taught. Teachers can't help struggling students if they don't know what students are interested in and the way they learn best. Therefore if students design their own summer projects they will be actively engaged in what is happening and understand what they are learning. Teachers the following year will then have a little bit of knowledge about what interests students, what will help them be more engaged, and how to help out students if they are struggling. With students being able to design their own summer projects it will benefit both students and teachers because students will be interested in what they are learning and teachers will know what students are interested in so they can help students in a way in which they can actually learn.

Student-designed projects will help increase grades and academic performance as well. With students being able to design their own summer projects, this allows teachers to help students utilize the way they study best by breaking down the way that their project was completed. This is important because once teachers are able to help students figure out the best way to study then their grades will go up and they will be doing good in school. But on the other hand if teachers were to design projects every summer students might not like the specific task he or she is assigned and it will cause them to lose interest in the project. If the student loses interest in their project it will also cause them to not do the project anymore and if it is graded then they will already have a bad grade for the quarter and that is already a bad start to the year. This will also cause a bad reputation for the student as a first impression and the student will not be able to get all the help he or she needs to be able to study well.

School is a main way for students to be able to express themselves through what they enjoy and the topics they favor. Students being able to design their own projects is a big way in which students can express themselves because by representing what they enjoy they can have a chance at being able to learn more about that specific topic in school that year. By doing a project on something that interests you it shows the teacher that you are interested in that topic and that could cause the teacher to want to teach it to the class and you will be able to understand and want to engage in class conversations on the topic because it's something that you would look forward to. This will also help by giving you the opportunity to show what you know and to be able to engage in a topic of your liking. By being able to design a project and fulfilling it, it will also show that you are doing it because you want to where if you were to do a project in which was designed by a teacher, they will not know whether you are completing it because you have to or if you want to.

Students being able to design their own projects will really be able to show whether they are committed to doing a project. It will show whether they are ready for the class and if they would be willing to spend a good amount of time specifically for the project. It will also show if they are ready for college and if they are prepared. Most importantly it will show what kind of student they are based on completion and effort. Being able to design your own summer project is a big responsibility and you need to be dedicated to finishing and working hard on your project not only because it is required but also to help you figure out the best way in which you can learn. Since teachers don't know what students are interested in it would be better for students to choose how they want to create their own projects. Overall if students were to create their own projects it would help identify in which way they learn best, what kind of a student they are, and what they are interested in.",5,Summer projects,Independent
F9D397FC0259,"Statistics state that about 85% of schools require students to complete projects during summer break. Almost every project planned is teacher-designed. Many may agree that teachers should not design these projects but allow students too. Some may believe that projects should be teacher-designed for the ciriculum. I believe that summer projects should be student-designed because they will be more diverse, students are more likely to complete them, and they can understand it better.

Many projects that teachers design may not be appealing and creative. Teachers may repeat the same projects again and again to give to students. Students should be able to have fun and be enthusiatic when creating a project. A great deal of students are very creative and diverse and can show on the projects they create. Students will be able to express themselves and show their ability to complete summer assignments over breaks. It would motivate students to create a great project to present. Projects would be more appealing to students if they were able to choose their own.

A statistic said that over 50% of students do not complete their summer projects. Most of the projects created aree teacher bases. This shows that many sturdents are uninterested in the summer projects that teachers plan. If students were allowed to design their own summer project, it would benefit more students. The rate of students compleating their summer assignments would rise.

For example, students want to be able to have a great time during their break, not be required to complete school work. So having them create their projects would mean, many more students would be more willing to create their projects during the summer.

Students may have trouble understanding what a teacher is requiring them to complete in the summer projects they assign. They also may not be able to contact the teacher, to get information to get a better understanding of the project. Students understand themselves better than anyone else can. If the student does not understand the requirments, it could discourage them in completing the task. So I agree with allowing students create their projects for a better understanding.

To conclude my thoughts, I agree that summer projects should be student designed because they will become more diverse, students are more likely to complete them, and many are able to analyze them better. Students have many ways of expressing themselves through their work. Students creating their own projects and completing them shows that many are interested. I believe it is a better way of learning for students. It motivates students to do better, complete their work, and be more diverse!",4,Summer projects,Independent
FCA264AE51EF,"Summer projects are often used as a way to ensure continued enrichment of American students during break because they have a longer time off. There is the debate however, should the projects be designed by students or by teachers? Students should design the projects because it allows for creativity, is a chance for personal exploration, and the fact that the student is on break would be respected.

School, unfortunately, is the place where creativity goes to die. Students have to adhere to a set schedule, with few deviations and personal choices, where the teacher decides how everything happens. This paired with the fact that schools in America often have the teachers organize their class around a standardized test makes it almost impossible for true creative, educational exploration. A summer project designed by each students would be the perfect way for new ideas to be created and tested. Bringing in and encouraging creativity in the youth is an extremely important part of ensuring that society will be run by people who think outside of the box, who bring new perspectives in. Also, being creative has proved to be good for maintaining mental health. Many times in therapy creativity is used as a way for the patient to be calm and work their problems out in a positive and constructive way. For example, art therapy, which is all about using artistic ways to work through important issues. This is also why, in recent years, adult coloring books have become popular. They allow a person to be creative even if they're not artistically inclined. Considering that many American children, highschoolers especially, struggle with mental health issues, giving them a chance to be creative could prove to be very beneficial for alleviating some of those problems.

Another reason why students should be able to design their own summer projects is because it gives them a chance for personal exploration. Youth is all about changing, figuring out who you are, and becoming something new, but in stricter societies this desire to explore is squashed by social structures that rely on conformity. Allowing the students to study something they're passionate about is an excellent way to give kids the chance to develop as fully as possible. School doesn't make for good personal exploration, in fact it's the exact opposite. Students are rarely recognized as individuals, they're referred to as a whole, as if they're part of a hive mind. The rules are all made as blanket statements, one persons mistake is now every bodies. Which, this cannot be held against the school, it is efficient to do things this way, but from a students perspective, it can truly weigh down on them. Years and years of feeling like nothing more than a herd of sheep is discouraging, and that is the reason why many talented individuals slip through the cracks. Think of people who are known for their innovation and strong talents like Bill Gates, Basquiat, etc. Now consider their schooling. Most didn't really flourish in school but rather later on, when they had graduated or dropped out, were their talents really appreciated. So, student run summer projects are one of the best ways to have students explore their interests and talents, while still maintaining the ""this is a grade"" aspect that would curb the lazy tendency to give up on ideas.

The final reason summer project should be student run is that break should be respected for what it is, a time to relax and re cooperate. If a teacher was to set up the project, it would be tedious work because the teacher rarely has a true personal investment and interest in the project they're assigning. There would be unnecessary essay parts and it would be on a topic like local civil war history, something that few children are wanting to spend their summer thinking about. Speaking from personal experience, when a project design is left up to the student, it feels much less like a chore and more like something that they want to do. If kids pick their projects it could make learning something that is looked forward to, not avoided. It wouldn't be fair to students to take what they have always known to be as their time, and dampen it with something that looms over their head, that puts a damper on the whole breaks.

Summer projects are an amazing way to make sure that the three month break isn't put to waste, but they are only truly a positive thing if the student is able to design them. Students designing their own projects would allow for creativity, exploration of themselves, and still respect the time they have off. Yes, it can be said that kids today need to ""suck it up"" or some other entitled phrase that stomps on their opinions, but just like adults, kids deserve to enjoy their free time, even if their regular time isn't taken up by hard adult troubles. Why force students to grow up earlier than necessary? Why not let them enjoy this easier life without a grownup throwing another boring responsibility at them? Children have little say in their lives, they should be at least able to choose how they spend their free time.",6,Summer projects,Independent
F4B17EF5C67E,"The preservation of human consciousness is essential to understanding our universe, this being said I am unfortunately uninterested in this topic because my summer is more intense academically then my school days, but this is a great prompt for an eleventh grade written paper and I will gladly show my gratification for the chance to become a more intellectually stable human being and discover the proper way to advance my knowledge in what I don't know. Thank you for the first steps.

After thinking about this topic and realizing that I'm not in any position of power I figured out that some students are not exactly thankful and do not care about their education even though the learning structure in Virginia is incredible compared to other countries, or even states. But unfortunately too many students choose less significant factors of education. Of course what I mean by this is we don't focus on the most important topics, instead being more focused on the social attribution that the schools give us. In my personal opinion summer break should disperse around the school year evenly so education can be taught all year allowing for; minimum stress, better attention in schools, and so summer isn't the most look forward to part of the year, unfortunately though this will not happen until more students understand the quality and purpose of education. Getting to the point, I believe that students should put multiple efforts into discovering foreign countries to learn how grateful we should be to have a function able learning system.

These experiments should be created by the teachers since they have the intuition to complete a task and will make proper choices to make sure the students arent overwhelmed with stress, but a considerable amount of mental stimulation is pushed into action with each chosen summer project. Unfortunately some teachers may have lost connection to how they felt when they were in the position of the student, but this can be a good thing since the more intellectual discoveries one experiences, the better choices they will make through out their lives, and for the lives of others.

Some may argue that each student knows what is best for themselves, since each person is unique and no one project will interest every student, and I agree with this to a certain degree. So a multitude of different projects should be able to be a student selective of types and display an exciting amount of variety. such as; building homes, masonry work, political and economic trips to different parts of the country and projects that allow the knowledge of how beautiful this world's natural state can be, but it doesn't have to be expensive, it can also be as much as local viewpoints and a reading quota to make sure that the students are involved in furthering their education while outside of schools.

So to wrap this all up with a pretty bow, I believe that students should not be allowed to choose our own path of development, inside and outside of the campus. Education should be left to the people with a strong knowledge to ensure proper development for every student. Thank you for reading and I hope to receive insight on how to better my opinions and persuasive writing abilities.",3,Summer projects,Independent
EDF68039869C,"Kindergarten through high school students go to school for about 9 months with a few breaks every now and then. The big breaks include thanksgiving break, winter break, and spring break but the most important break of all is summer break, which is 3 months and concludes the previous school year. Subsequently following this break students tend to forget most of what they have learned. For this reason some schools require students to complete summer projects to continue their learning while out of school. while the project itself is a good idea, the assignment should be student-designed because it'll allow more free time, allow students to be more creative, and allow integrity to be present.

When summer comes around there is usually a vacation in the plans and if not then pools are open,because of this students want to get out and do stuff and if the project is student made this will allow them to be more free during their break. Usually a project is a summative grade and can really make or break your grade so for the most part students will get it done. Although there would be less organization than a teacher made project this allows students to focus on more than just one topic. on vacation there could be a variety of things to write about or research from the different geographic's to the destination or even the amount of gas it took to arrive to the destination. An important part of the break itself is for students to enjoy them self, with this project made by them they can go at their own pace and still have time to their self.

With imagination comes creativity, these are two things a project needs to be a success. Students will be able to create their own project within appropriate reasoning which will allow them to focus on a variety of ideas. However if the project was made by a teacher then students would be more than likely to focus on one topic, which can get boring and leads to incomplete work. As a matter of fact, if the students are able to choose what they do for the assignment then more students will complete the project by their own will. Throughout high school creativity can benefit you in a big way if this project is student-designed the students will explore their imagination along with their experiences through their break.

Integrity; To do the right thing when nobody is watching . During this break students are left no teacher supervision and they have to complete an assignment on their own, this project if student designed will teach integrity throughout students. with integrity this assignment will create a trust bond between the teacher and student if they complete the project. Eventhough a teacher made project would bring more structure among this project, allowing students to choose their own project is preparing them for college and the real world. For this reason students should take advantage of the opportunity, respect the trust of the teacher and follow through with their project. Doing the right thing when nobody is watching can bring you to success throughout your life, if this project is student-designed then integrity will be shown throughout the assignment.

Kindergarten through high school is about 13 years, and throughout a whole school year we go for about 9 months with a few little breaks every now and then but the most important break is summer break. Summer break is 3 months long which concludes the previous school year. Since this break is for a longer time than usual students tend to forget what they have learned. Schools usually give projects to keep the students learning while out of school. The project itself is a good idea, however it should be a student-designed project because it will allow students to have more free time, allows more creativity, and allows integrity to be present within students. A project during the summer seems to take away from the meaning of summer break, but in reality you can enjoy your break while keeping your brain active so you dont lose your progress throughout school.           ",5,Summer projects,Independent
9987A0266A4F,"Why does everything school related have to be about teachers? It should definitly be all about the students. If they're going to give students projects over the summer this is my input on how I feel about it. Projects should be student designed because students get to show their full potential of creativity and they'd acually want to do this project because it would be done how they want it to be done.

Students getting to show their full potential of creativity would be a positive effect on students and teachers. For example a lot of teachers don't like seeing as much pictures and colors a student would like on their projects. Which causes students to think projects are boring and not fun. There is no student in the entire universe that likes anything boring, especially work giving on a break. So if you're going to give them a project on their summer break. Let them put as much creativity they want on the project.

They'd accually consider doing this project because it would be how they want it to be done. For example during the 8th grade my class had a project due when winter break was over. The project was so dumb we could'nt put certain colors in our slides, and the words had to be in a exact font he wanted. The funny thing about it no one completed the project in that class. This proves no one wants to be told how to do their project. No one wants to be told what they can and can't put in their project.

Teachers are trying to make the project students are required to do teacher-designed. However they're wrong, because if they're going to give students projects during summer break. The students should be able to design it how they want to. Who wants a project they have to do and can't design it how they want to. That isn't fair to the students at all.

Projects should be student designed because students get to show their full potential of creativity and they'd acually want to do this project because it would be done how they want it to be done. So if you're going to require students to do projects over the summer break. Let them do as they please as long as they finish the project.

8C57C1D980FD,"Various schools agree that summer is the optimal period for learning; however, they are indecisive over the issue of designating teacher-designed or student-designed projects as the prominent method for students to prepare for the next school year. Many teachers spend time creating projects for students to ensure students have an adequate grasp for their oncoming course. Additionally, schools mirror the success of other schools by attributing the idea of summer projects into their own curriculum. Students often procrastinate on summer projects because the summer projects do not captivate their attention, and they view the assignment only as a complementary task. While some schools may argue that teacher-designed projects align with the concepts addressed in class, student-designed projects enable students to discover ideas individually and increase retention time for them.

Student-designed projects provoke a stronger understanding of a topic because students spend time garnering information and relating it with current events. For example, incoming A.P. Spanish students need to familiarize themselves with content which relates to the themes covered in the class. They may design a poster for each theme by organizing current events under an example column and summarizing the most pertinent details found from their research. Student-designed projects benefit students because students are inspired to conduct research on the topic, and students are not limited to guidelines. They promote a higher capacity for creativity because students expand beyond the parameters of the subject and force students to actively engage with the project. The flexibility of student-designed projects can cover a topic more comprehensive than teacher-designed projects because they stretch beyond just the bare bones of a topic. Semantic encoding, the act of obtaining memories by relating information directly to the source, increases retention time because the students grapple with the topic, and they encode the information to long-term memory. By storing the information in long-term memory, students can prolong the retention curve, a graph that depicts an increase in memory loss as time increases.

Teacher-designed projects provide a snapshot of the course because they contain significant elements that are modeled after the course's itinerary. At the end of the school year, tenth grade English teachers dish out a list of recommended books to give students a head start on the book review project due shortly after the break. The book review project requires identifying the author's argument and tone which helps students develop the skills required for the analytic essay component of the A.P. Language and Composition exam. Teacher-designed projects expose students to a strict interpretation which allow students to extrapolate the necessary ideas and disregard the trivial details. They are not intensive to complete because their primary function is to spark interest with students and are merely a precursor to the course. Although they may abide by the topics of a course, they fail to prepare students for the challenges of the course. On the contrary, student-designed projects require huge amounts of effort and incorporate additional information that can allow students to gain a deeper understanding than teacher-designed projects. Teacher-designed projects can limit the perspective of students because they follow the same perspective of the teacher who designed it; meanwhile, student-designed projects can allow students to gain a global perspective of the topic and de-emphasize the focus of students on themselves but on other issues occurring throughout the world.

Although schools utilize teacher-designed projects for summer learning because they stay within the confines of the teacher's syllabus, student-designed projects are ideal in fostering intellectual growth for students because students are permitted to seek a plethora of sources which enhances their learning and they strengthen their retention of the subject due to constant exposure with the material. In a foreign language class, students are given the opportunity to design their own projects. As such, they expand on their Spanish comprehension because they rely on their own research to provide prototypes that can be incorporated into the course, and their homework is easier because they can cite current events as examples in their essays. In an English class, students are given a teacher-designed project to experience the superficial concepts of the course. The lack of challenge offered by teacher-designed projects is devastating to a student's mastery of a course and impacts the view that students have on a topic because they may be biased at a certain topic. One effective way to implement student-designed projects is to provide a list of the topics covered in a course and allow students to approach the project by choosing the format that suits them rather than a rigid structure that may put off students from completing the task.                 ",6,Summer projects,Independent
C4118746172C,"In order to assure that students are learning over the summer, some schools require students to complete summer projects during their break. Some people believe that summer projects should be student-designed, while others believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed. All in all, summer projects should be student-designed.

First of all, if projects are student-designed, then the students will actually want to do the project and learn things from it. For example, most of the time when teachers give students projects, they are pretty boring and students don't want to do them. When students create their own projects, it gives them a little more motivation to do them because they're allowed to do it on whatever topic they want to.

Secondly, if summer projects are student-designed, then students won't be as stressed about the project as they would if it were the teacher's project. For example, the projects teachers give students are sometimes hard and it makes the students stress and struggle to get it done. When students create their own projects, it's less stressful because they get to choose what topic the project is about.

Although these views are correct, there are some who disagree. Some people believe that students don't learn when creating their own projects to do. They also believe that students aren't capable of doing their own project without the assistance of a teacher. However, students technically do learn because when they are doing research about their project, they are reading and learning things about it. Also, if the students need help with their project, they can get the help they need from a parent, friend, or a family member.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed. When students design their own projects, it is easier for them and it motivates them to want to learn. Although some people may disagree, these views are correct. Students that create their own projects are less stressed out about the summer projects, therefore making them more likely to succeed on their summer project.",4,Summer projects,Independent
D463BB44024B,"Today, students go to school to pass, rather, than to learn. Students' views have changed because children have lost motivation. They see school as rather a task than something that will help them in the future. I, for one, see school as more of a prison. My assignments are chosen for me and I am forced to go to school from September to June. The break I look forward to, summer, is a time for relaxation and fun. A school project during summer, for learning, is anything but fun, unless it could be. A student-designed project would allow students to express their themselves in a different way, get more freedom from their teachers, and bring change and fun to a student, during their well deserved break.

In school, students are rarely able to show their creativity and passions through the set curriculum. Students' identities are set based on whether, how well they do or do not do in school. Teachers do not get to see their students' strengths outside of how, ""book smart"" they are. Student-designed projects, however, would be able to change this. Through student-designed projects, students would be able to show a different side of them self. A side that shows their passion for helping others, who do not have the same opportunities as them, rather than reading a book written by Shakespeare, or a side that likes to learn about the environment, and how to protect our Earth, rather than writing an essay about politics. Students will feel better if they know that their teachers and schools are genuinely interested in them. Students need to know that they are cared for and that someone is interested in seeing them succeed. Students are so much more than what they show during school. There is potential in everyone, but students can not show it when they are trapped. Students need to feel reminded that smartness and intelligence is not just based on grades or scores.

Children are forced to attend school by law. We are forced to take tests and do projects that we do not have a say in, or else, we fail. There is no freedom, however, that could change. During our summer, we should get the decision to design our own projects. Our break should not be controlled by teachers like they do normally. When given the choice to do something we enjoy, we will see it less as work, but rather as fun. The common saying, ""If you do what you love, then it will never be considered work,"" is very true in this instance. When doing something enjoyable we often forget that we are doing it. We see it as more of a hobby, rather than a task to complete. While projects should be student-designed, they still can be approved by a teacher to instill that it assures learning. A chance to choose our own path may be seen as risky, but it is really for the better. Learning should be fun and interesting and not a task. We students forget that we are supposed to be learning because we are always being told what to do. Freedom will allow us to see school in a different way. We will feel motivated and interested in the projects we choose, which will allow learning to happen.

Student-designed projects would provide a change for students. School assignments are all given and set upon by teachers. There is a certain curriculum, which does not provide change or freedom. There is hardly leeway for students that enjoy different things. Teachers do not realize that students are all different. We all have our own strengths and weaknesses and different preferences. Student-designed projects would allow students to switch things up a bit. Students would be able to be the teacher for once and do something they find enjoyable. Some students like to write, so they could choose to write a report on something they find interesting, while others may take the artistic route and paint something completely different, but while they are still learning. Summer is a break and should be different than what school is normally like for a student. A student works hard throughout the whole school year, so they deserve a reward or change. Student-designed projects would be something they could look forward to during their summer vacation, and not something they might dread. An assignment during the summer is already a task, so why not make it a fun task.

If a school requires students to complete a summer project they should be student-designed because it would allow students to express their creativity, while still learning, freedom, and change. Students will be more motivated and interested when given a choice. Summer is a time for a break after a long school year, so a given assignment should not be something uninteresting to a student. Learning should not be forced and there are many ways to change the minds of students and how they perceive school. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
690D9455E629,"Some schools are requiring students to complete projects over their summer break to promote learning whilst outside of a school setting. However, the schools are debating on whether the projects should be student or teacher designed. In my opinion these projects should be designed by the student. It would promote creativity within the students. Also it would allow for the students to make a choice for themselves.

Allowing these summer projects to be student designed would promote their creativity when completing the project. It would ensure that the students can express themselves freely while completing the project. The students would be able to unleash their full potential at their own pace. This would give the student more incentive to complete the project knowing that they have the chance to show they can really do. Also it would give the teacher a good look at what their student is capable of outside of a classroom

Also, this would let the students make a choice on their own rather than what the teacher says. It would help them become more independent and self reliant. The students already have to do what the teacher says during the school year, so this would make for a great chance for them to do what they need to on their own time. It would also teach them to be responsible for themselves and for their own work. For example, if the student understands that they are no longer in a classroom setting where the teacher explains everything to them, they will conclude they must rely on themselves to complete the task at hand. Which would lead to more independence rather than depending on the teacher.

However if the project was designed by the teacher it would b a more stable and set curriculum. The teacher knows exactly what they are looking for, so for the project to be designed by a teacher would allow for the project to be more organized. On the other hand, it would take away the idea of creativity and the chance to express ones self had the project been student designed. Which would lead to less effort being put into the projects. If the students are given the chance to do as they please freely they can put more time and effort into it.

Schools allowing for these summer projects to be created by the students would be greatly beneficial. It gives the students a chance to be as creative as they please and express themselves openly. It also is a good opportunity to teach them the importance of self reliance and how to take responsibility. These are all valuable skills that are going to be needed by the students during a later time in life. It is good to get these skills in early so that the students will understand how to use them later when it is important.",5,Summer projects,Independent
BAB28ABA8ECE,"As a student grows and moves futher through there educational career, more and more work will be assigned over the summer.

Durring the summer you are between years and may not know who your teachers are.

This also means that the teachers may not know who their students are.

Because of this, summer projects should be student designed, students can adress what areas they need the extra practice in, have a choice in what they learn, and tey can emprove their learning by doing something they love.

Each student may ave an easier time on one subject over another, the further through schooling a student is the more apparnt this becomes.

Take me and my sister for example, I have a very difficult time in english and history due to the way they are tested apon.

I have a difficult time with tests where there may be more than one right answer in a multiple choice senario.

Finding the one question that is 100% accurate vs. being 75% or 50% accurate is difficult for me.

Thats why I can excell in mathmatics and the sciences, there is only one right answer.

On the other hand my sister is the opposite.

She does extreemly well in history and english and has a difficult time in math and science.

This is evident in every person you will ever incounter.

Each learns, remembers, and thinks differently from the next.

Therefore, teachers, who have never met the students they are assigning work to, should not have a part in a students summer learning.

My class may end up with alot of math practices and very little history, this will help my sister greatly improve her math but I will still be behind on this history while others may be far ahead.

Many might argure that all students should get the same work so it is fair.

This is entirely unrealistic, it is not fair for me to get 2 pages of math and be able to finish it in five minutes while it take my sister three hours.

It is not fair that I dont recieve the help I need in history because my sisters needs were put above mine.

With this in mind think about what school is truly here to do for the young generations that pass through its system. Yes, school is here to encourage learing, but in its basic foundation school is here to prepare us for the future.

Take the book Educated by Tara Westover for example, Tara never went to public school and receved very minial education from her parents.

Thus when Tara entered the real world she struggled grealty.

School is here to take some of this struggle away.

By teaching students skills and trade aswell as math and english.

This is alother reason why summer asignments should be student designed.

By having assignments be student designed, they will learn to make choices.

In the real world you have to make hard decisions and stick with your choice.

In the real world you have to choose what you need to do over what you want to do.

In the real world you have to put in the effort and show that you care, even if you don't.

By giving students the choice of what they can work on, by leaving assignments open ended, it will teach them how to make good decisions for their future.

The level of openness can be decided dy the school if need be but what comes out should be 100% the students idea.

With the freedom to choose what they learn based on their own needs they will get the best education posible.

Every person on earth learns significantly better when they enjoy what they are doing.

Even me, who does not like history can learn it.

I have traviled all over Asia and even lived in Japan.

I lived on a small southern Japanese island called Okinawa.

While I was ther I envested my self into learing everything I could about my home.

Me who is terrible at history can tell you the histroy of Okinawa back a thousand years to when the Ryuku Kingdom was flourishing.

The only push I needed to be able to learn a difficult subject was enjoyment.

When someone enjoys what they are learning and can connect with it they will learn much faster and much more.

By alowing students to control their summer assignments they can learn these difficult topics in a way they enjoy. They may also take a new vew on something, see something from another persons perspective, or find that they love a subject more than they previously thought.

Maybe its through watching historicaly accurate movies like, Hacksaw Ridge, D-Day, Midway, or War Horse.

Maybe it is through fun math riddles and compitions.

Maybe it is by spending the day with a granpa and hearing his accounts of the war.

You can also begin to foucus in or figure out what you want to spend your life doing.

My grandfather was a pilot and after years of hearing his and my mothers stories thats what I want to do.

I want to be a pilot like my grandfather and be in the military like my father.

I only want this because I have learned to love to travil from my parents and the military is where I grew up.

It is apart of me that has only been nourished by what I have been alowed to learn and experience outside of a closed classroom.

By allowing students to design their own summer learning the students will learn to chose what is best for them, adress their own needs, and enjoy what they are getting to learn.

This will open doors for students that may never close.

It introduces them to real world aplications of what they sit in a closed room learing for most of the year.

It can help students interact with others more, causing them to talk to people and make friends where they had non perviously.

Maybe it will incourage students to try something new, weather that be a new sport, type of art, instument, or to try and write a book.

Out of all of this its most siginificant effect is, it introduces students to the joy of learing, how the real world behaves, and exposes them to enumeral opprotunitys that will influence what the student will want to do with his/her life.

0D91FC8A9FE7,"For students, summer projects can feel like a lot, summer break is supposed to be filled with fun times and vacations while projects are almost the exact opposite. Removing summer projects all together isnt an option, so when it comes to the question ""should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed"" teacher-designed projects reign supreme, as it benefits both the student and the teacher in multiple different ways.

As a teacher, your main job is proving students with a learning experience that will help them grow as people. Having a student design a summer project would not be nearly as powerful as the impact a teacher-designed project would. Teachers are well informed and know a lot more than most students and because of this it is their responsibility to provide a student with a project rather then have them create one themselves. This is especially reinforced in younger children, such as grades k-6, as they still need a lot of direction and having a student-designed project would not be as viable or coherent as a teacher-designed project.

Teachers have it difficult sometimes, as they are trying their best to provide students with a learning experience, but teachers also deserve to have their job be a little easier. Creating a teacher-designed project as opposed to a student-designed one, would be far easier to grade and create a rubric for. In student-designed projects you have a lot of variety and no one follows a central guideline, however in a teacher-designed project, you can maintain the variety but also contain a set of rules that benefits both the students and teachers, as the students have more clearly defined rules to guide and provide structure to their projects. This also benefits the teachers, as they can easily grade the assignment and provide a fair grading experience.

Finally, teachers have everyone's best interest at heart when designing projects. Teachers will always design something challenging and beneficial to the students education. Students, especially younger ones, cannot be trusted to design a project that would be as beneficial as a teacher-designed project. Students often take shortcuts or the easy way out and while sometimes this can be beneficial to the students and their education, it is more often harmful then doing it the right way and teaches them to be lazy. A teacher-designed project on the other hand, would be designed with the thoughts of providing an enriching experience to the student and hopefully making them a more successful and educated person.

Teachers play well informed, and important roles in a students life while they develop, and education is a very big part of student development so, projects should be designed with a teachers interests at heart. Because of that, when it comes down to it, teacher-designed projects are generally more helpful, easier, and responsible then a student-designed project would be.",5,Summer projects,Independent
EC347BE5ADE4,"An Essay on Summer Projects

Summer break for students is easily the best time of the year. Summer is time to have fun, enjoy the little things, and get into new hobbies. Unfortunately, these lighthearted and laid-back couple of months are marred by the mandatory summer projects assigned by their teachers. Instead of spending their time going to museums and looking at fossils, or rockets, or anything interesting to them, they're forced to do papers on old British novels about daily life in Victorian England. Instead of allowing these students to pick their direction in life, they're shaped into squares through the way that they're taught to follow instructions. Students should be able to design their own summer projects, to not only continue their learning throughout the summer, but to also inspire individuality, creativity, and even a sense of direction in life.

First, on the nature of summer projects. Summer projects are assigned for a few reasons. They attempt to ensure that students are doing some kind of learning over the summer. They also attempt to ensure that students do not forget how to learn. As for the success of this method, I am unsure, so I cannot say whether or not these projects are useless wastes of time for most students. On the other hand, in my experience, the few students who were told to do a project but instead blew it off, choosing to spend their summer time as they wished, tended to then also spend their time during the school year ignoring their responsibilities as a student. Those who did their work over the summer were more likely to be responsible students, making genuine attempts to learn in school. Through this correlation, one can assume that summer projects positively impact a student's education. Of course, correlation does not equal causation, but it does follow a clear trend.

Now onto my main assertions. By allowing students to direct and design their own projects, students will have to take time thinking of topics that they would want to work on, giving them an opportunity to develop a sense of self and consider their own interests. Time for introspection and the considering of options for the future are often skipped in schools, and the entirely open-ended nature of a student-designed project would be possibly a better learning experience than doing a regular project on it's own.

Students don't often get chances to exercise creativity during school. The only possible outlets are fine arts classes, creative writing, and the rare, ever-elusive, enjoyable project. An ""enjoyable project"" entails choices, certain liberties, and a chance to express yourself through your work. Research is still required, the learning still happens, yet it's an all-around more pleasant experience. While it might be easier for teachers to grade carbon-copy research papers on a choice between three topics, it's not nearly as interesting as grading projects on a variety of topics in a wide variety of formats. Giving the students an opportunity to get to show what kind of person they are and their interests helps give purpose to the projects, and teachers get interesting introductions to their new students. Through this opening of options, not only will the students still learn during the summer, but it becomes a positive experience for both student and teacher.

Through contemplation and research, students are given an opportunity to find something they're passionate about. This can be crucial for a student's development as a person, giving them something to think about and study for.

For example, if a student finds that they're somehow incredibly interested in the formation of lichen, they can load up on science classes and take high-level biology and environmental sciences and eventually become someone who studies lichen to make a living. And that's what school is all about. School aims to get people interested in learning more, and to prepare people to find a career they enjoy and can make a living off of. That'd be quite the productive summer project. An opportunity like that inspires learning much more than, say, reading an old book about a couple of cities and writing a paper on it.

None of this is to say that the project can't have limits, or minimum requirements, of course.

A very rough guideline is necessary to ensure that people aren't hypothetically turning in a project consisting of no more than seven dead mice stapled to a posterboard, claiming that they did hours of research to find out that mouse traps do indeed work as intended. Instead, students should be expected to show their research process, include citations for their sources, and provide annotations or commentary on why and how the mice died. Projects can not be productive if there aren't certain rules and procedures. The issue with teacher-directed projects is that there is no limit to the limitations they can put in place. If the project is meant to encourage students to learn over the summer, why should it be restricted to just a few certain topics? There shouldn't be limits set on a student's learning. Summer projects are meant to benefit the students the most, so why should they be held back from their full potential?",5,Summer projects,Independent
890BA90FED9D,"Teachers are paid to give students their insight, and teach them to the best of their ability. So why not let them do their job? Teachers should design the projects that their students complete over the summer. This is because they are more experienced, educated, and objective than their students. Teachers are more experienced because they have spent a lot more time on the subject than their students have. Also, many teachers have received a formal education in teaching which gives them a better insight on what to assign over the summer. Finally, many students would prefer to have no summer project. Therefore, many students would be bias in the creation of their own summer assignment. Letting students design their own summer projects would not be implausible. However, students would overall benefit from completing teacher-designed projects as appose to their own student-designed projects.

Teachers are more experienced in teaching than their students are. Many teachers have devoted many years to teaching students. These teachers have learned what assignments are most effective and how to stimulate their students in such a way that makes them interested in what they are learning. My English teacher has been teaching English for 30 years. She is one of the best teachers I have met because she has accumulated lots of experience throughout her 30 years of teaching. Student would never hope to create an assignment as well as an experienced teacher. This highlights the gap between teacher and student. Many students would benefit a lot more from letting teachers create their summer projects. Additionally, teachers have more than just experience.

Teachers have received a proper education in teaching their students. Many teachers go to college to receive a formal education in the art of education. This gives them more knowledge than the students in how to help them learn. My chemistry teacher has a bachelors in teaching and a masters in organic chemistry, it felt like she had an endless well of knowledge on chemistry. It would be a lot more efficient to have teachers ,who have spent years learning how to teach do their job, than to relegate that responsibility to students who have no education in teaching. Even if these teachers don't have the best education they should still design their own summer projects.

Students are very subjective when it comes to the topic of their own assignments. Most students would prefer to receive no summer assignments. If they had the opportunity to assign their own summer projects they would try to give themselves as little work as possible. In 6th grade my teacher gave my class an assignment called the ""genius hour project"" in which the students had the entire year to research any topic they were interested in. Many students took advantage of the nature of the project and tried to give themselves as little work as possible. Some students even ""learned"" topics they were already well versed in to try to put in as little effort as possible. Even if this is a small sample size it shows the nature of students and how they are willing to take the path of least resistance even if they dont really learn anything.

In conclusion, teachers should design their own summer projects because of a multitude of reasons. Teachers are more qualified to design the students their own summer projects because teachers have more experience, education, and insight on teaching. On top of all of that they are also more objective when designing summer assignments, especially when compared to their students. I do believe that students do have the ability to create their own summer projects, but it would be more effective to let the teachers do what they are best at. These are the reasons teacher should design their own summer projects.            ",5,Summer projects,Independent
79BF06DEF9AA,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Summer projects provide teachers with a way to insure that their students continue to learn while they are on their big break during the summer thus, making sure that the students are prepared to learn again once the break is over. Opponents may say student-designed summer projects are superior to teacher-designed summer projects since they produce more creative end products or becuase the student does not get confined by guidelines. Although some believe summer projects should be be student-designed, it should be known that summer projects must be teacher-designed.

Teacher-designed projects benefit the teachers in many ways, one of these ways is the ease of grading. For example, if a teacher designs the summer project than all of the projects grades can be based on the same rubric thus making it more efficient to grade them. Another way teacher-designed projects benefit the teacher is the potential for a larger turnout. To elaborate, if the project is designed by the teacher than presumably the instructions will be easier to follow than if the student had to make it up on their own meaning that students who would normally give up and not do the project due to not being able to come up with ideas would now be able to complete the project and as a result, more projects would end up being turned in. Finally, teacher-designed projects benefit the teachers as they are easier for the teacher to design. For instance, it is a lot more efficient for the teacher to type a set of specific instructions rather than a large list of things the student can or can't do for the project because the set of instructions is much less broad of a topic and hence easier to design for efficiency.

Although teacher-designed projects have many benefits for the teachers them selves they also provide many benefits to the students, one such benefit to the students is the easy to follow guidelines. To elaborate, when the teacher provides a set of guidelines for a given project it is a lot easier for the student to complete it since they don't have to worry nearly as much about where to start or how to set it up. A secondary benefit of teacher-designed projects for the students is the new perspective it provides. For instance, the student may already be biased about the topic they are doing their project on but if the teacher sets up the project in a specific way than that may give some perspective to the student and as a result, the student will create a better project. A final benefit of the teacher designing projects for the students is that it insures the students are learning what they need to know. For example, if the student designs their own project then there is a high likelihood that they will design it around something they already know a lot about to make it easier on them selves, but if the if the teacher designs the project than it will push the student to learn new things and they will be better off for it.

Although some believe summer projects should be student-designed, it should be known that summer projects must be teacher-designed. The opposition may suggest that student-designed projects are better because they give students a voice or allow more students to be able to do the project however, teacher-designed projects are superior as they benefit teachers by increasing submission turnout, making grading more efficient, and making it easier to design furthermore, teacher designed projects benefit students by providing easy to follow guidelines, giving students new perspectives, and teaching them what they need to know. In conclusion, more classes should hand out teacher-designed summer projects over student-designed summer projects.          ",4,Summer projects,Independent
BAC5264E2DCE,"At schools, who require students to do projects over the summer, it should be the students who design what project they do because if they decide the topic they will complete it, they can go on various adventures to learn about the topic, and they can have fun with it. No student likes doing work over the summer, so if they're choosing their own topic it would get them to actually enjoy learning about it. Even during the school year most students hate doing projects because the teacher assigns mostly boring projects, that no one wants to do. When they're completing the project they can set up how they're going to present it to. If your school did this, what would you prefer to do?

If the students choose the topic they complete a project on, they will actually think about it and get it done. They can use their creative side of their brain and come up with a very educational but exciting project idea. They can ask they're friends and family to help. They can also use the internet if they don't find enough real life and personal resources.

Then, once the students picked their idea of their project, they can go on various adventures to learn about the topic they need to study. They can ask their parents to go on a vacation or vacations to any area specific to learn about it. When they're in the area they could go on tours of the city or country they're in. They can go see the landscape and learn about the past/history, especially if it's a historical spot.

Keep in mind they're still just kids they need to have fun from the project, especially if it's over their summer break. They need to have crazy and fun nights with their closest friends, I mean maybe their friends could teach them something about the project they have to complete. Hanging around their family at a cookout is always fun in the summer, and their family could have their own knowledge about the project. Staying up all night on the internet may not be smart, but it sure can can lead you to information you could learn for your summer project.

In conclusion, students should be the ones who get to choose what their educational projects are going to be about over their summer break. If they create the topic they will actually get it done knowing that their school didn't give them a boring topic to learn about. They can also go on many crazy and exciting adventures to tour and get information on anything they need. Most importantly they need to have fun because summer is about having the time of your life, but they can also learn about fun and educational topics.      ",3,Summer projects,Independent
6F515B25A68B,"The last thing students want to do during summer break is complete an assigned project for school. Often times students are going on vacations, spending time with family and friends, or even just trying to relax from the previous school year. Summer is an opportunity for kids to explore their freedoms and luxuries of life. Students will most likely wait until the last few days of summer to begin a project designed and driven by their teacher. This then makes the teacher look like the ""bad guy"" for assigning the project in the first place. These summer projects need to be student-designed to give them the opportunity to be creative, have a real motive and passion to complete the project on time, and still have fun during the summer like they would be in the first place.

During the school year, students are consistently encouraged to be creative and think ""outside-the-box"". That creativity should not be stripped away from the students now that summer is in full swing. People often are more filled with creativity during their younger years as children and teenagers. Young kids often explore their creativity by making forts, assuming roles in games such as ""cops and robbers"", or even thinking of new games or toys to play with. Teenagers explore their creativity often by making new inventions, creating new ways to help the environment, or trying to find ways to make the world a better place. These summer projects can be a chance for kids to explore more about something they may want to do and get a chance to find out what really interests them. This can then lead to what their future career choice may be when they go off to college and such. Some might say that the students may get too ""off-topic"" if they design their own projects; however, the teachers can still have requirements the students need to follow, while having the students design what they want to do. Younger students will need more guidance to get started or to know what is expected of them. These projects need to have a main focus of being mostly student-designed, rather than completely teacher-designed, in order to prevent and confine the creativity of our future adults that will one day make impacts on our world.

Real passion and a desire to do something is rare for people to find early in life, but when they do eventually find it, their lives change forever. Steve Sabol was the creator of NFL Films and is responsible for the recording of some of the most memorable moments in NFL history. Steve, at a young age, loved to play football, but also had a passion for film making and art. He soon realized that he had a passion to do something no one has ever done before and that was combining football with the film industry. Steve and his dad recorded the first ever Super Bowl in 1962 and edited it into cool video montages. They did this every following year and quickly gained lots of notoriety. The NFL took notice as well and partnered with them to create NFL Films, which still stands today. All it took Steve was time to find out his true passions and put them to use in his career. Giving students in school the ability to research what they want and produce what they want in a project, opens so many doors for them and their future. The students can design their project their way, which may actually have them be more willing to put forth real effort over the summer, thus giving teachers what they wanted in the first place, students continuing to learn over the break.

One of the main purposes for having summer break is to allow kids to enjoy their childhood and have fun. Giving a teacher-designed project to these kids will create a dark cloud over their summer, especially if it is something boring like writing an essay, conducting an experiment, or creating a PowerPoint. Yes these may be good ways for the kids to express what they might learn, but the topics should be of their interest and not all of the teacher's ideas. I once had to read a book and write an essay during summer when I was going into the sixth grade. It was absolutely awful, and the main reason why was because we all had to read the same book and write the same prompt for the essay. The book was about a young girl and boy falling in love while raising baby chicks, which is not my kind of book. I would rather read a sports, mystery, or even maybe historical fiction novel before a romance novel. I would have loved to complete the assignment if I was given my choice of a book and prompt; however, that is now all I pretty much remember about that summer and not for the right reasons.

I cannot remember a teacher that has shot down my creativity and wanted me to be like everyone else. The job of teachers is to have kids learn and show improvement while having an influence and impact on their lives. These summer assignments will most likely not even be a grade, so why be so strict with them? This can be a chance to change a young student's life and have them start off on the right foot with their teacher. The students' summer should be fun and enjoyable, while still maintaining and gaining knowledge. The best way to balance both of these is making their projects student-designed.",6,Summer projects,Independent
51B8712EF620,"When doing projects over the summer usually teachers or the school districts come up with ideas for how the project should be done. But what if students came up with these projects? Think about how much easier and less complicated they would be. More time to work,less complicated and more easier, and learning a fun way to do it. Students designing these project could make a change and benefit to students all over the world.

Students designing other students these projects would make it much more fun for other students. Other students know how teachers design work which isn't the way they would. Students would make it fun just because of the school year and all the learning you did then. Students communicate on different levels and this is what is going to make it easier for the students to learn. Students are also less detailed than teachers. For example if a student were to design a what, where, who, why, and how questions on a project it would be exactly that, but teachers on the other hand would ask for summarys and larger paragraphs. This way is less complicated, and straight foward instead of heading off in every other direction. With students it's only one direction. These projects would also be less boring because students tend to think like other students and these student that are designing these projects knowing for a fact it's summer time and it's time to have fun instead of being stressed and worried about turning it in on time.

Speaking of time, students always tend to do things at the last mintute, or teachers give them a short period of time to do the work and turn it in. Students wouldn't do that. They would give you the good amount of time to do these projects. Like what was said before, its the summer, and in the summer people travel or people visit other people and this can cause distractions. Students can still give you more time to finish what needs to get done. Therefore, if a teacher were to design this project it would be long and difficult and due within two weeks. Nothing like how students would grant you like a month or two to turn it in knowing that it is the summer. This also means students might also be more distracted unfortunately.

By having students designing the projects they might not learn as much as they need to. This is why teachers do all the designing. Teachers make it harder and longer for students becuase doing it short and simple is too easy and you are not learning anything that way. They also make the deadline shorter because they know students will get it done. If the time is too long the students will most likely end up forgetting about it. Teachers also detail their projects more because the want students to know more than the basics of what they are trying to teach. This will educate the student more, that way when summer is over and the next school year comes around students have it freshly stuck in their heads and will not struggle as much.

Students designing these projects would be a great idea and should be started really soon this will definently benefit other kids in the future. By doing this it will make everything less complicated. This would help out both teachers and students. Because of this schools or teachers mights just change they way teachers teach and the way studentss learn. More time, less complicated, and more fun will helps in a way it didn't before.",5,Summer projects,Independent
F8474CC7670F,"In the summer when schools require students to complete summer projects I think that these projects should be teacher designed, because if the projects we're students designed the projects wouldnt be as much of a learning process then if it we're a teachers designed project.

first of all why I think that summer projects should be designed by teachers is the learning process of the project. Projects are for students to show what they know and learn more about what they have to research and they would have to take more time in finding factual research about their topics. This is good for students in the summer because it keeps them intact with school in some shape of form and it would keep the students occupied rather than them playing video games, or doing some other thing that rots their brain. To add on by teachers giving out projects in the summer will also benefit the students as well. For example my cousin Adam who lives in newyork was enjoying his summer like any other teen would do, well while he was doing what he was interested in doing he also did not something school related all summer such as reading, researching etc this also too a toll on him because since he wasnt doing anything school related over summer he began to lose focus more in school.

Secondly, why I think teacher should be designing projects in the summer is that it gives them something to do while just doing nothing all summer long. Students could be doing things completely different from school during the summer days, by teachers giving out projects could possibly keep students out of trouble during the summer and it also get their next year of school started off to a great start by them doing the projects. Also by teachers hand out projects in the summer shows that they truly care about their students education and would love to see them succeed and expand their knowledge furthermore.

My third reasoning on why I think ti should be the teachers who design the summer projects is that they are not likely to do projects if they had to design it them self. To add on for example if students were allowed to design their own projects they would most certainly become less focus because they would feel like they wouldnt have to do the project as much or take as serious because they're the ones designing it and not the teachers. By the students designing their own summer projects and most likely not doing could really hurt their school life and their start off grade for the start of the new school year.

Although, some may say that students should be able to design their own summer projects because it allows them to show the teachers what they can do by them self, also lets students work at their own past, and wont overwhelm the students because they get to design anything i their choice. This may be true but like I said before students tend to lose interest and focus more quickly if they seem that the task isnt as important to them. So by teachers designing these summer projects would make it seem more important to the students and it would make them want to do it even more and get benefits out of it.              ",4,Summer projects,Independent
F245631F4D97,"The end of the school year has finally come, and you can't wait to be swimming with your friends and family, however , that day will not come. Instead you are assigned your worst fear; a dreadful , hideous , and disgusting summer assignment. When all hope is lost your teacher gives you a final decision.

""Should the assignment be teacher made or student made?""

A summer assignment is a chance for students to perfect their knowledge and make sure they don't forget what they have learned throughout the year.

A teacher-designed project is best for the students , because the purpose of the teacher is to guide their students on a path of enlightenment through the education system, students are inherently lazy and will make an easy project, and it provides the teacher a bar for which a teacher can know how advanced their students are before they come to class on the first day.

The teacher has an obligation for the county and the state, and it's to insure that students are prepared to become adults. An educational study at Yale shows that students who go to cram school over the summer have a tendency to achieve a higher score on the SAT compared to those of a self taught student at home. This is without a doubt, proof that a curriculum and or project assigned from a teacher is best to give a student to insure that they retain previous knowledge and can build off of it. With the teacher giving a direct projection and project on what a student needs to know also helps the student, because the student doesn't have to aimlessly ponder on what the teacher wants them to know next year. It allows students to have a narrow and direct line of sight to their goal , and enables to teacher to have a direct overview on the project.

Students are inherently lazy and result to the easy road rather than the challenging path. If a summer project was Student-designed the project, would be of the most basic and rudimentary work a students would want to finish it as fast as possible. As seen in the daily lives of Generic_School students, in which 65% take non honors or AP level courses. We can see a trend that students are not willing to challenge themselves and would not be capable to create a project, in which the project would be academically sufficient for their studies next year. Furthermore it can be shown on a global level in which the United States is ranked within the top 15 but not top 5 based on educational levels. If we as an American culture can't rise up to be a leading power in education with the help of our teachers, how can we expect student-designed projects and studies to do any better.

A teacher-designed project will allow the teacher to know what level the students coming into the class are capable of. The Generic_School system as had tremendous amount of trouble in which teachers have to ask for multiple planning days. The reasoning for this is due to the fact that students don't knowing the fundamental requirements for a class when they walk into the classroom on the first day. This causes teachers to have to readjust their curriculum in order for the students to catch up to where the teacher wants them to be. A teacher-designed project would allow the teacher to tell the students the basic information they need to know before they come into the class, it also allows to students to prepare their mentality going into the school year.

The development of human society as a whole is told by its children and those who can help cultivate the young. Teacher-designed project would provide students a strong foundation for the year to come, it stops students from being lazy and wasting their talents, and helps teachers formulate a more precise teaching curriculum for their students. These examples alone show that summer projects

9C9986ED9D48,"Everyone loves summer. This is because of the weather, how the environment becomes and also people get the opportunity to explore more things during this season. During Summer, students are given some months off for vacation. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to ensure they continue learning during their break and this should be teacher based not student based. Although some may think otherwise, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know more than students, teachers are also seen as parents in school so it is their responsibility to guide students and also, teacher designed projects helps students to use time productively.

To begin, teachers know more than students. For example, teachers go to college or training institutions to be shaped to become who they are. They learn a lot from their schooling process. A teacher once said, "" A teenager has been a child before but has not been an adult yet"". This shows that teachers have more experience and knowledge so they have the responsibility to give students assignments and projects because they know best and they have been students before.

To continue,Teachers are also seen as parents to students. In school, because students are away from home, they may have certain things they would like to discuss with an elderly person. Who may they as? There is no doubt that the students will discuss with their teachers for help. This shows that a student will always need help from a teacher. Also the same way students go to help from teachers, it is the work of the teachers to give students assignments and projects. All these reveal the essence of summer projects being teacher based or designed.

Moreover, Summer projects being teacher-designed helps the student to use time productively. Imagine students creating their own projects for summer. Do you think it will be of any importance to them? Well, there is no way it will be. This is because, if students create or design their own projects, they may do it anyhow because they are not given any guidelines to follow to make a good project. Students may even get distracted because it is vacation and this may lead to procrastination. If a teacher designed a project for students, they would take it seriously because the teacher is their leader and parent in school so they follow instructions given by the teacher in order to be graded or rewarded for the good work done. Students will succeed if they follow instructions of a teacher than to rely on their own means.

To conclude, there is a huge contrast between a student-designed and a teacher-designed project. Teacher-designed projects are more likely to make students successful and also they learn to use time wisely and productively. This will prepare them for the future to become better individuals. I agree that summer projects should be teacher-designed.            ",4,Summer projects,Independent
34B565833A33,"Summer projects have always been a sticking point for students and teachers alike. The battle has raged on for years about if summer projects are an effective way for students to learn, or if they are just a waste of time. Most students do not like summer projects at all because they aren't designed for the student specifically. Instead, teacher's design a project that they think will satisfy the most people in a given class, and for that reason my position is that summer projects should be student-designed. This is because it gives more tailored assignments to fit the students wants and needs, it lets them explore something they may be interested in, and it lets students choose their own workload.

Rather than designing a project specifically for one or two people, the teacher's goal is to make a project that is designed to be completed by an entire class. While this is less work for the teacher and students, since they are not creating their own assignment, it has many drawbacks. For one, it is very likely that what the students need and what the teacher thinks they need don't line up. This causes conflict between the two groups, with students coming to hate summer projects because in their mind, it's just another generalized school assignment for them to finish up at the one time they feel they can get proper rest. It also causes conflict between the student's current teacher and their teacher next year. These teachers are very likely not working together to make a summer project, so your teacher next year could completely disregard the project that the other teacher gave, and you would have done all of that work for nothing. If it was a student-designed project however, not only would it be something that the student is actually interested in and wants to work on, it would lessen the workload of the student's teachers, as they have one less thing to worry about in their giant pile of stuff they have to do. On top of that, the project can be fitted to that student's wants and needs, by removing certain sections that they wouldn't be able to remove if it was made by a teacher. They can also add their own spin on the project and do it the way that they want to. Those are just a few examples of how a student-driven project can be adjusted to fit them specifically.

For many teacher-designed summer projects, students are usually given one topic to work on. Students do not have a choice: whether they like it or not, they have to work on that one topic. With a student-designed project, they get the freedom of choosing their own topic. This opens up worlds of possibility for that student, as they can now choose something that interests them, not their teacher. This is very important because many students note a major lack of interest in summer projects, so this could be a way to get students more involved. Of course, this subject has to be in the scope of the class. For example, you can't work on a project about the anatomy of a polar bear in a US History class because that topic has nothing to do with US History. So while students aren't given complete freedom with their topic choices, they get a lot more than if the teacher made the project. That's why its important that students work on something that they're interested in.

Teacher-designed summer projects are designed to be finished in one way only. Usually, there is no room for students to cut a section out or do the project a different way because if they don't follow the teacher's instructions then they could lose points for it. With a student-designed summer project, the workload and structure of the project is chosen by the student, not the teacher. This means that students have more power to change the assignment in a way that they believe they can finish it more effectively and churn out the highest quality project that they feel that they can produce. They also have more power when it comes to revising and editing their projects, as they have no guidelines set by the teacher on what they can and cannot do. For those reasons and more, control over workload is a valuable asset for students that is only had with student-designed projects.

In conclusion, summer projects may always be a sticking point for both students and teachers, but there are ways to improve things on both sides. That was is through student-designed projects. Because they are tailored to the students, are interesting to the students, and allow students control over their workload, they are the far superior way for summer projects to be done. It may not be the perfect solution to an issue like this, but it is far better than teachers deciding what they feel is best for students. Teacher's may think they know what is best for their students, but at the end of the day the students have lived with themselves their whole life, while their teacher has likely known them for less than a year. The student knows themselves inside an out, while the teacher gets a surface view of that student. Something needs to change, and the only people that can make that change are me and my fellow students.",6,Summer projects,Independent
11CE345BAEF2,"Throughout the world one out of a thousand students need help on their projects. There is an on going debate over students should complete summer projects to continue learning during their break. Those who disagree, student designed should not be a summer project state over thinking and not going to finish but this not true. Although some disagree, summer projects should be a teacher designed.

There are a variety of reasons why there should be a teacher designed project. One reason is that students have a guide. Teachers will give students directions that may help them with the project. For example, students might need to see how to do the project. Another reason is students can get done faster. For instance, teachers prioritize on projects; therefore, the students can be done faster over their summer break. Also, the teacher may already have some projects in mind over the break. There should be a teacher designed project because students want to get ahead. Furthermore, teachers may want students to finish it to turn the project in on time. For instance, teachers probably want the students to get ahead in there next year of school.

There are further reasons why it should be a teacher designed project. One reason is it helps students understand. In addition, some students may not understand how to do the project on their own. For instance, teachers can help students understand if they do not know how to make up their own project. Another reason is it expands students learning. Some teachers want to help the students; also, it helps the students mind to be refreshed when they come back to school. For example, teachers may want the students to be able to know what they learned for the last few years. Doing a teacher designed project is better because of an easy grade. Therefore, students might turn the project on time after there break is over. For instance students probably want an A at the beginning of their course grade.

Ultimately, although some may disagree, summer projects should be a teacher designed this is the case due to student guide, get done faster, and expand learning. Those who oppose state over thinking and not going to finish but this is not true. students should have a summer project to continue on learning",3,Summer projects,Independent
6C01498EEE9B,"When kids get off school during the summer, it's important for them to continue learning so they are able to go back prepared. By giving these children summer assignments, they are able to build their knowledge from when school ends to when it starts back up again. Although these assignments are helpful, there are different ways that schools go about giving the tasks. The summer assignments could either be teacher-designed or student-designed. Both of these techniques prove to work on the students, but the teacher-designed assignments seem to be more helpful compared to student-designed. A few of the many important reasons why teacher-designed projects are best at continuing the learning process are the students are able to get the correct materials directly from the teacher and students are challenged with the work they are given.

During the summer, if children are given teacher-designed assignments, they will be given the correct materials from the teachers instead of them guessing what will be learned when returning to school. Summer assignments are designed to prepare students for their future classes. Without the teacher giving their future students what they will be learning, it is nearly impossible for the children to know how to prepare themselves for their class. If a student, for example, is taking a math class in the future that has trigonometry in the curriculum, how would they know to learn trig without any teacher reference. With the help of teachers, students are more likely to do better in the class because they know what they are going to face once they come back from summer break. Preparation is the most important aspect when students are going back to school. Along with giving the students correct materials, teacher-designed summer assignments give the kids an opportunity to challenge themselves.

Student-designed assignments, unlike teacher-designed, allow the students to be challenged and improve their learning skills over break. When children assign themselves their own work, they tend to choose easier assignments because the work load seems too much for them to handle. For example, if a child has the ability to choose what to write their essay about, they will most likely choose something easier which affects them improving their learning abilities. With teachers designing the assignments it is guaranteed that the students will be challenged since students have no control over what they have to do. This will benefit the students in the future when it comes to the material they are learning because their learning ability in that subject improved over the break. This will make the students better off in the long run even though they could potentially have a more difficult time completing the assignment. If students had the ability to design their own summer assignments, they would choose tasks that would not improve themselves but instead choose one that is easier so it's completed faster with less work. This does not benefit the student but, unfortunately, hurts them. This is because children will not be as prepared in the class which could ultimately lead to a bad start of the new school year.

Although teacher-designed assignments are very helpful, student-designed work can carry less stress for the student during their break and make it more relaxing for them to complete. Usually when kids get their summer assignments from their teachers, it creates more stress for them when they are supposed to be relaxing from the long months of school. With having the students prepare their own tasks, they are able to pace themselves throughout the summer with less worry on their back compared to teacher-designed assignments. For example, if a student has the ability to create their own science assignment, they can review what they already know along with some new material on the subject which could ultimately bring down the amount of stress put on the student to complete the assignment. This makes their summer vacation more enjoyable along with them having the ability to continue learning without teachers having to assign them projects. Students, when teacher assign them their work, tend to get more stressed of the fact that they have to get it done in order to get a good grade. Student-designed work gives them the opportunity to learn on their own which could potentially benefit them better than being assigned something from the teacher.

Both of these methods are great when it comes to students continuing their learning throughout the summer, but teacher-designed assignments guarantee success when it comes to improvement is the children's learning ability. Although student-designed work does limit the amount of stress put on the student, there is no way to know that the work they assign themselves will benefit them when they return to school. When teachers design the assignments, students are given the correct materials directly from the source and the students have a better opportunity to be challenged; both reasons will help their grades when they go back to school. Summer assignments are really important for preparing students for the future, so giving them the best path for success can be achieved by teacher designing the work. ",6,Summer projects,Independent
0EB16BF9C6D8,"Are summer assignments really fitting what a student needs best? Summer assignments consist of work that the students are requested to complete before returning to school at the end of summer. These assignments are created to ensure that the students continue learning during their break and is a great way to help the students excel in what they learned, while not being at school. There is an on-going debate whether or not these assignments should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer assignments should in fact be teacher-designed, as it maintains the teachers standards for learning, grants the student prior knowledge for the upcoming year, and enables equal work for the students.

Some may argue that having summer assignments that are teacher-designed will be repetitive, not focusing on the students weak points. Though this may be true, it is easily avoided. Teachers can diminish this issue by meeting with the student prior to the school years end to discuss the topics that students needs more or less work on. This would eliminate repetitiveness and cause the student to become stronger in the topics he or she is weak at.

Summer assignments are a great way for students to not loose the knowledge they learned in the past year while learning new things that he or she may see in the future. These assignments should be teacher-designed to help maintain his or her standards. Without doing this, students would just design their summer assignments to require less overall work, having a more negative affect on the student. Maintaining the teachers standards would allow the teacher to assign the topics he or she feels is necessary for the student to learn and is not too easy or unnecessary. Maintaining the teachers learning standards goes along with giving the student prior knowledge as to what they might expect in the future.

Teachers have the best knowledge of what students will be learning in the upcoming year. This is a key argument to the claim that summer assignments should be student-designed. If summer work is planned out by students, they will not learn about topics they may see in the future. Having teachers design the summer work will allow them to include a sneak-peak as to what they may see in the year to come. This is very important as it gives the students an advantage when starting their new school year. Teacher-designed summer assignments would not just give the students insight into their upcoming school year, but also enable equal work between the students.

Students work very hard over the long school year. Teachers try their best to allow equal work for the students so that one student is not given more work than the other. Some students may not need as much work in a certain topic compared to others. Teachers will most likely assign said student different work from the others as it may be unnecessary for that student to focus on a topic they have already mastered. This often creates conflict between the students, arguing that they have more work than others. Teachers can attack this issue by working with the student to find out what best fits the students capabilities. A great way to do this is to give the students work based on what they need to improve on, but making the time it takes to finish the assignments equal. Examples of this include: giving the students that only needs to focus on one topic much more work in that topic and giving the students that need work on more than one topic a more widespread list of topics, but still maintaining equal time it takes to finish all of the work.

In conclusion, summer assignments should indeed be teacher-designed to enable the teachers standards for learning, prior knowledge for the upcoming year, and equal work among the students. This is a very important topic and should be discussed thoroughly when in the topic of summer assignments. I urge you to take this into consideration next time this discussion is brought up in your school or community.                        ",5,Summer projects,Independent
E134EA4073AE,"Summer break is meant for fun and time with family and friends, but students don't really notice that they are losing the skills and knowledge they've collected. They really only care about having fun, not learning. Students always look forward to summer break, but tend to slowly lose some of the knowledge that they've retained throughout the school year. This results in not being prepared for the up and coming school year. Students come in confused and unprepared causing them to fall behind. Imagine coming to school on the very first day and having a hard time remembering certain topics. You're ability to understand your favorite subject has slowly slipped away and the teacher is moving on to more complicated topics. This sets you back and makes it harder for you to understand the new topics being taught. If most or all of the class is confused and having a hard time, some teachers are forced to push back lessons in order to insure that everyone is caught up, while others may just move on creating further confusion. It puts teachers at an ultimatum; Should he/she risk the completion of their curriculum for the new year to help the students who couldn't retain the previous knowledge, or move on knowing that these people may not pass their class? Teachers have found a way to solve this annual issue without having to reintroduce a topic to the class. They have created summer projects. These projects usually have something to do with the new curriculum for the new school year. Whether it's a reading assignment, essay, or even a vocabulary assignment, it is all meant to prepare the students and get them thinking early. A discussion was set in motion on the topic of: Should summer projects be student-designed or teacher-designed? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know what skills all of their students need in their classroom in order to succeed and carry on with the rest of the year without any set-backs or complications.

When designing project assignments, teachers make sure that this project will develop a better understanding of a topic in the student's mind. They base it off of what skills these students need to acquire and improve their class's ability to comprehend the topic. For example, a student wouldn't know how to create a project for algebra 2 if they had just completed geometry and have no background knowldge of algebra 2. They would need a teacher's guidance and detailed directions to complete this project. This also creates a level of understanding for the student coming into the class. During the summer, students lose thought of these topics, but if teachers created projects for them during this time, they would come in fully prepared. Everyone would have an equal level of understanding because they all are prepared for the same thing. Equal opportunity is very important in a classroom because every student needs to feel like they can comprehend what they are learning in order to succeed. If students go out on their own and design their own project, they may not feel pushed to try their hardest. A teacher creates equal opportunity by creating the same guidelines for all of the students. Teachers also have experience with students in the past and know what topic to hit the hardest based on past experiences. They will design these projects to push the class to their highest potential and make sure that each student is taken care of.

Student-designed projects wouldn't be a smart idea because kids tend to do the bare minimum. If students design their own project, they wont know what topics to understand or why they are studying a certain topic. this leads to an unequal understanding of a topic which doesnt help students in the future. They might just do a little assignment that doesnt require much work or effort that doesnt challenge them just to enjoy their summer a little more. yes, some students work hard, but they all come in not knowing what exactly this new year is going to bring. Students should have the right to think on their own and create new ideas, but this should be further down the school year once the teacher is certain they understand what they are learning. For example, in my English class, our teacher made us all read and annotate the same book. once we came to class she gave us a vague writing prompt asking what the argument was in the story. Because we have all read he book and annotated it how she wanted, we were all able to write this essay and understand it. Some may argue that a student needs the freedom to learn on their own, but also need to consider the fact that not every student wants to try as hard or even challenge themselves. This is why students need a guide to show them the way in order to create a better understanding. it's a basic understanding that in order to succeed and be independent, one needs to have grasped some knowledge and relied on a teacher to have given the knowledge. This is why there are teachers in the world. they are here to be there for someone and be there as their guide because they know what is best for them in education.

To conclude this argument, teacher-based summer projects are the best way to insure a student's ability to succeed in their class. It takes out the factor of inequlity and allows the student to hold onto previous and future knowledge. This helps them undertsand what they are learning in class and reduces the risk of getting left behind. Teachers are here to guide their students to success and cannot do so if their students are lost and getting left behind. If it were student-designed, they would be least likely to push themselves to their greatest potential. They also wouldn't know what to study. These points should be cosidered in the topic discussing whether or not teacher-designed or student-designed is the best possible option for a student. ",6,Summer projects,Independent
F2DFE12EA3B4,"Many students have expressed that projects should not be given over summer break. Students feel they should not have to do work during their summer break, Just as much as teachers shouldnt not have to grade papers over their summer break, If summer projects must be assigned they should be student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because the students would know how to complete the assignment, they would also find more interest, and more then likely the project would be completed with effort.

Over the summer most students are sent home with no instruction or contact availability. Students would attempt to do the assignment with no teacher guidance or help from others. With out the proper help the project could be completed wrong and completed with out any effort. When attempting to do my own summer project I stumbled into a problem and had no way to correct the problem, If summer projects were student made there are no excuses for not understanding how to complete the work.

Every student has a least favorite class, many would complain about a summer project from a boring or hard class. More students are likely to complete something that is more appealing to them personally. For example art is a more appealing subject to one, while someone else could be interested in history. Making your own project could be more intriguing which will make someone want to actually do the assignment they have created.

Majority of high school student do not complete their summer project. When a student completes the work it is more for the grade then personal gain. With the option to have students create their own projects brings creativity, interest, and effort. Many individuals put more effort into their own creations like art, putting more effort will cause more learning for the students personal gain, and the projects would be done nicely.

Many schools require summer projects to be completed. These projects would be more beneficial if students were able to create their own assignment. The idea of student designed projects are more beneficial because students would know how to complete the work, they would find more interest, and the project would be completed with more effort put into it. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
54C09D108011,"Summer projects for schools are becoming more popular because schools want their students to continue learning while out of school. Over summer students tend to forget the subjects they have learned. Some schools believe it helps to have summer projects. When students come back from summer break they do not remember the material for some of their classes. This can sometimes be difficult for teachers because they spend all semester teaching it to them. Schools think having summer projects will help with this problem. The summer projects that need to be completed by students should be student-designed because students know the best way they learn, students will gain more knowledge, and student-designed projects would be easier for the students to complete.

First of all, students know the best way they learn. Students know if they are better with hands on projects or writing projects. Typically, students are better with hands on projects, but other students enjoy writing projects. I am better with hands on projects. I remember when I was in third grade we had to do a project for our social studies class. My teacher just told me that it had to be on Greece, and she let me design the rest of it. I thought it was easier to design my own projects rather then her telling me how to complete it. Students will figure out how they want to complete the project before they complete it. If a teacher were to design it, the student would have to start it how the teacher wants it.

Furthermore, students will gain more knowledge. Students will actually have to read what they have to do the project on, then they will have to research. When the students research what they have to do the project on they will know what it is about. They would be reading on the subject so much that they would retain the information.

If the project was on the Declaration of Independence the student would have to find out what the Declaration of Independence is. Next, they would have to formulate a plan on how they want to complete the project. They would have to put all of their research into their project. This will help the student to memorize what the Declaration of Independence is. This would help by letting the student get a feel for what the subject is before actually learning it.

Moreover, student-designed projects would be easier for the students to complete. They would be easier for students to complete because the student would know what they were doing. If a teacher were to assign something the student did not know how to complete it would be harder for them. The student would not be able to contact the teacher during summer making it more difficult for the student to figure out how to do it if it were teacher-designed. With the summer projects being student-designed the student will know exactly what they are doing. The student would be able to complete it at a faster pace and turn it in at the end of the summer.

In conclusion, the summer projects that need to be completed by students should be student-designed because students know the best way they learn, students will gain more knowledge, and student-designed projects would be easier for the students to complete. There are many people who would say that having teacher-designed projects would be easier. Students do not always complete projects if they get a choice of what to do it on. Students are better at doing their projects off of what they design rather than what the teacher does. Being a student myself, I would rather have a summer project that I designed. I would not want to have a summer project that was teacher-designed.  ",4,Summer projects,Independent
CCAB0FEFDD57,"When you are taking an AP course in school, have you ever been assigned some sort of project to do over the summer to give you a head start in the course. The summer projects are designed to keep a student learning over the summer to ensure they retain the information that they will start to learn about. Teachers believe if a student can continue to learn even while they are not in school, it will positively effect their grades. Although students-designed summer projects could help the student retain information in a way that best suits them, teach-designed summer projects would be a better option because teachers know what the student needs to learn, the students would just give themselves minimal amounts of work to do, and students could start to get bullied by other students if they thought the summer assignments were too hard or too long.

The first reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is because the teachers know what the students need to learn. Usually summer assignments are given to give a head start to students preparing to take a class. If students were to design the summer assignments, they would not know what to put on the projects. For example, if a student is preparing to take AP Biology, and the summer assignment was teacher-designed, the student would be given work about cells or the nervous system, while if the project was student-designed, they could be doing work about chemical compounds which will not be useful to the student throughout the whole course. If the teachers were to design the summer assignments, students would have the best chance at achieving the highest grade for them.

The second reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is because students would give themselves easy work that an elementary schooler could do. If a student was given the option to design their own summer assignment, they would most likely give themselves a worksheet to do and thats it. This is because when students are on summer break, they don't think about school, they just think about having fun with friends and doing what they love. If student-designed summer assignments were given, the average grade of each class would most likely be lower than if students were given teacher-designed summer assignments.

The last reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is because the students who designed the summer assignments could get bullied. Bullying in schools is most certainly present. If the students who received the summer assignments found them too hard or too long, they would most likely find whoever designed the assignments and put them down. This will also lower the self esteem of the students who made the assignments. For example, if a group of students found an assignment extremely long and hard, they could find who designed it easily. They then could start to bully the student by calling them names and possibly even physically. If teachers were to design summer assignments, this would be one less reason for someone to start bullying another student.

Teachers are the people who design and teach each course a student could take in school. Because of this it would be most logical for assignments that help a student learn should be teacher-designed. If a student were to be given a teacher-designed assignment their grades would be higher. Teachers should design summer assignments because they know what their student needs to know, students would give themselves easy and short work, and students could get bullied because of long and hard work that other students don't like.",4,Summer projects,Independent
05F76135BBE1,"Have you every been told that adults always have to be around for teenagers to do the right things. Some schools believe that the project they give over the summer should be teacher desgined. I disagree with that for the fact that student desgined projects gives the scholars a chance to show they're responible, show that they have creativity, and show that they are willing follow directions.

My first reason is that teens can show their teachers just how responisble they are just by doing a project over the summer. I might sound like an easy task but its now. Students constantly are distracted by the other lives of their friends and family, therefore a Student might have a hard time complete a task such as this. You might think im pointing out the bad but if the student can overcome this challenge he or she will be on the path of becoming an adult; completing goals that you might not want to do but you have to do it. Student will feel more secure with themselves and more ahead in life. I cannot name a time where being responsible has had a negative outcome.

Next I would like to talk about creativity. The problem with the school system is that they try to limit what a student can do with their creativity. They try keeping it contained so the teenagers will not get out of hand. This choice of action made by the school board, I fell that it is selfish and unjust. In 2008 a movie Created by Disney with the name Lemonade Mouth was released in the movie symbolized that students should stand up for what they believe and get created as Antagonist plotted to take everything out of the school that had irrelaventcy to sports. I believe that students should have this chance to create their own creative ideas to finalize the process of figuring out who they are and who the students would like to become.

Finally I will add that letting students craft projects without supervision will shape them in a way such as following the rules that leads to becoming a productive member of society. Understand what one says and carrying it out without asking question is a tool most adults lack. Teens have an advantage to get this teaching at a young age. Everywhere you journey there are rules that you must follow: park here, throw trash away there, pick up your dog's dropping. We must always follow rules even when we don't want to. Students have the oppurtunity to have a trial and error basis now because once you become an adult there is no more playing around.

So in my closing I strongly agree with the schools letting their young adults achieve early success buy giving them a chance to exercise thier Responsiblity, Creativity, and Direction Following.",4,Summer projects,Independent
80877A1F0A7D,"Some schools should require summer projects. Only because it keeps the students still engaged with the things they have learned over the past year in school. When having a break for so long students tend to forget a lot of things they have learned such as math, history science and English. All subjects are important things that should not be forgotten. When kids are in school they normally get projects that are teacher designed. It would be nice for students to be able to designed things them self.

Being able to make your own project about anything you learned in school would be awesome. If the project was student designed then they should be guide lines. Such as turning in a paper on exactly what your project is about to get it approved by a former teacher. Only to make sure that they are not just doing a project that is about anything, other than school related topics. When having the opportunity to make up your own project, you should have so many new idea on how you wanted to due your past projects. When making a project in the summer you can go big or go home. If It is a science project you could build a huge blasting volcano. That shoots up a big ball of volcanic acid, that flows down and melts things.

When having a project that is designed by a teacher there is certain rules that you have to follow. Such as due dates,certain topics, and strict rules on how exactly the project needs to be done. Teachers give projects that are really harsh. There is most likely always a certain website or paper that is needs to be on. Not everyone wants to do projects the way teachers want them done. So, letting kids adventure out to do their own thing should be nice, as long as there are rules on what they are talking about. If the teachers could have one rule it should be having a project in every subject just to keep the information fresh in to there minds.

Summer is the time for fun, not to keep learning about things or trying to refresh your mind of certain topics that are in school. It is the time to relax and also not have to worry about when things need to be turned in or even the strict rules that teachers make students follow all year long. When in school students have to do so much homework, test and projects. So,having projects for all subjects or just one would be to much on the student. Kids during the school year struggle with these types of things. Students that have so much work in classes probably get really stressed, tired and maybe even depressed. Having a lot of work in school can put so much pressure on a person. So, having the little free time they can during the summer is great. So, what makes the school think that the kids want to still learn during the summer. That is the time to have fun with the family and not worry about school or anything else.

To come to a conclusion, projects should start happening at schools to make kids more involved with their school work and to stay focused. When keeping some of the information you learn, can actually help you remember things that you may need in the next class you are going to. So,when having a summer project there should be guidelines and certain topics. The project should be teacher and student designed. Only because there are thing that need to happen and not happen. So, at the end of the day the project is not inappropriate. ",3,Summer projects,Independent
