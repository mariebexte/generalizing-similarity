26D82BAF75DB,"Letting teachers design the project is the most ignorant design ever. Most students would hate to do a teacher design project. The projects should definitely be student design. I strongly believe a summer project is an intelligent way of letting students retain the information. However it should be student design because they'd be more likely to do it, they'd understand the project more, and it gives them responsibility.

Firstly, students would be more likely to participate in a student-designed project. A whole of of students won't be pleased doing a summer project, so the least schools could do is let the students design the project. Also some teachers make projects way too boring. So if the students design the project it'd probably be less boring for them. It'd be much better to let the students could be as creative as they want. When people find something boring they won't do it, especially young people. So letting the students design the project would increase the chances of the student passing the project.

Secondly, the students would understand the project more. Some teachers make extremely confusing rubrics for the project. When teachers make confusing rubrics it causes a negative reaction to the students trying to complete the project. Some students would lose confidence in themselves on the project, which will increase their chances of failing. That would be a horrible start to the new school year. The goal is for students to pass not fail, and teacher design projects would really increase failing chances. Students will have a hard time passing something they don't understand, because like I said earlier; some teachers make really confusing project-designs.

Lastly, is it gives the students more responsibility. Responsibility is one of the most important things a young person can learn. It helps with maturity & being a better adult. So the student would be responsible for the project & designing it. I know it's very little responsibility, however it does help.

Projects should definitely be student designed. Student design projects teaches students more responsibility. Also it would make students more likely to complete the project. If schools do make summer projects, I hope that they are student designed. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
9733EB28C206,"Would you want to waste your summer on useless information, or getting a head start on what you are going to learn next year? Teacher-designed summer projects usually prepare you for what you will be learning. So, why not take that chance and have a head start. Teachers make these assignments for the students benefit. It is always better to be prepared, than to be struggling. Summer assignments should be teacher-designed, because the teacher would relate it to what they are going to learn, they could give the students a challenge and choices, and their topics could be more relevant to society.

Although, teacher-designed summer assignments could be more relevant, student-designed assignments would be more fun. The students know what they are interested in more than teachers do. Students could create and design summer assignments that they would enjoy. Doing something fun and entertaining to the students would make their summer not feel like a waste, even though it is for school. However, it may be more fun than if teachers made the assignment, but it would be a waste of time and effort. Students could make the assignment whatever they want and not have it benefit them in any way.

Having a summer assignment about what you are going to learn could help you prepare for that class. Teachers know what their students will be learning, so they should make summer assignments related to that. The assignment would then prepare them for that class next year, and their summer would not have been a waste after all. This could help many students, because everyone learns at a different pace. Students who need more time than others to comprehend the information would be getting a head start. So, when they come into school, they will not be struggling or behind everyone else.

Students could get a challenge or a choice to choose what they want, benefiting them and their interests. If students came up with the assignments, they could be too easy. Teachers know a students limit by their academic skills. If students had a challenge in the summer, it could be something they have never experienced before or thought about. Students would be learning and enjoying their summer at the same time.

Summer assignments should be relevant to society and not useless information. Teachers are usually aware of what is going on in society, whether that is economically or politically. They could make a summer assignment about an issue in our society. If there was a summer assignment like that, there would be many online resources to help the students since it is a current topic. This would also benefit the students by enlightening them in the problems of their own society and community.

In conclusion, summer assignments should be teacher-designed to benefit the student. Not all summer assignments are boring. They might require you to read a book or do some research, but it would help you in the near future. Students who do summer assignments are less likely to be confused or behind in class, since they had a preview of what they were learning. Teacher-designed summer assignments benefit students by giving them a head start on what they are learning, the assignment could be a challenge or a choice, and the topics could relate to society making it more relevant. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
2F191B309816,"School is stressful. Not only during the school year but now during the summer. From extracurricular activities to preparing for the upcoming year, the summer can also be a time of stress. Students from all over America are forced to participate in summer projects designed to reinforce the information they learned during the school year. While this idea makes perfect sense, one must evaluate how these projects are designed. Summer projects should be student designed because this can improve creativity and eliminate stress; although one could argue that eliminating structure would result in a poor learning opportunity, teachers must think positively about every student's potential.

In school, almost every project is teacher-designed. This occurs so that teachers can assess a set of skills a student can perform. However, implementing a student-designed project would help students find their true passion in a field and help them become more creative individuals. For instance, when a student is forced to create a science experiment on a specific wild plant, there is no creativity involved in selecting what to study. However, if a student could choose which plant to study and what experiment to do, it could improve a student's creative thinking skills. This student-designed project would also help students find their passion for science by having them discover a plant that truly interests them. Summer projects should be student-designed because of the increased creativity and innovation when students can choose what to study.

Nowadays, stress is apparent with almost every student. The stress of pleasing teachers is often what forces students into a hatred towards school. When a teacher designs a project for a student to complete, it can turn a potentially fun learning opportunity into a dreadful and stressful assignment. For instance, if a student is forced to complete a history project on Abraham Lincoln, a student may see this as just another thing to be completed. However, if a student is given the opportunity to complete a history project on any president, he/she may find it entertaining to research one of their favorite people in history. This can greatly benefit the student because many students learn best when they are not stressed out about a specific goal. The lack of stress causes them to have a relaxed time while still obtaining valuable knowledge.

While summer projects are valuable to ensure that students have retained information, they should not be teacher-designed. The summer should be a time where students can choose what to work on in order for them to truly find their passion. This can help to improve a student's creativity by allowing them to participate in an activity they are truly interested in. Similarly, this can help a student to eliminate stress by finding enjoyment in their project. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
C88300C2CA72,"Should summer projects be student-designed or teacher-designed? Since a lot of schools do require a summer project for students so they will have some type of work to do over the summer, it is much better for the teacher to create the summer project. Teachers are trained to give work they know is somewhat suitable for the students. For that reason projects should be teachers designed because they know what type of work to give their students, they usually would not assign something outlandish, they also would not make it as easy as the students will make it be.

Some may argue that students will challenge themselves and not make it easy. People may also say that some teachers assign are a little outlandish and could be very hard for them. some may also say that students have a lot of things to do over the summer like jobs and sports and maybe even both. But not every student has those responsibilities and the others who do should find a little bit of time for their projects. Next, a reason for why teachers should design projects are because teachers know what type of project to design for the students

First reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers know what type of project to assign. Reason for that is because teachers most likely having been assigning projects for years know what type of projects may be to hard or maybe to easy for some students. Most teachers by the time it teachers summer will have a good understanding of what some students can do and can not do, and they know if they should make it challenging or make it somewhat easy. Teachers will try their best to not make the projects too hard for the students to complete for example a teacher would not tell their students to read like say ten books and then summarize them, reason being is because they know not every student has the time to complete it if they have other things going on in their lives. Secondly, teachers wold not assign something that seemed very outlandish or bizarre.

Secondly, teachers would not assign a project that was outlandish and bizarre. Like for example a teacher would not tell you to write 5 full essays in MLA style have it hand written and also typed. Reason for that is because even though summer may seem long it can actually go by very quickly and many students have things to do over that period of time. For example a student may have a sport that has practice everyday or may have a job that requires them to work everyday. With that in mind teachers would make it challenging but will try to not make the projects very outlandish. Another reason for why teachers would not assign a bizarre project could also be that not all teachers want to grade a lot of papers. For example if they were to assign something like a few essays and a reading project all the grading they would have to do is much greater than the work the students had to do, just because their are a lot of students who may have done the work. In addition to teachers making the projects outlandish and bizarre they would also not make the project as easy as the students might make them.

Lastly summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers would not make the projects as easy as the students may make them. Students usually like to not do anything over summer because they think of it as their break from work and projects, so if the school allowed the students to make them the students might make it very easy so they do not have to do much. Students would take advantage of them being able to make their own projects for example, students may make a a easy project like read a comic book or something like that and not do that much. The teacher however will make it somewhat challenging like for example they will assign a project that would not be very easy but will make it somewhat hard. Not all students will make it easy their are some students who will challenge themselves to do good and make a good project. But it would be better and more efficient if the teacher were to design it. Lastly, in all it would be more efficient if the teacher were to design the summer project

In conclusion teachers should design the summer reading project because they know what to assign to their students, they not gonna make it outlandish or bizarre, they are also not gonna make it as easy as the students might make it. Teachers get paid to each students so it would make sense if the teachers would assign the summer projects because they know what type of assignments to give for the students. After all of this is done i want you to,look back and realize why teacher should make the summer projects and why students should not be able to.                       ",4,Summer projects,Independent
83A7376E9454,"Many students would like to be the ones deciding what project they will do over the summer instead of having it assigned by a teacher. However they may not make wise decisions and they are very likely to choose the easy way out. Therefore, Students should not be allowed to design their summer projects because students will choose something that's too easy, students will procrastinate if they know it is their choice, and students will choose something they're already familiar with and will not learn anything new. Teachers need to assign these summer projects to ensure that students are having a positive and helpful learning experience over summer break.

One reason students should not design their own summer projects is because they'll choose something that's far too easy for them. For example, If Generic_Name tells Generic_Name that he gets to decide what his summer project is, Generic_Name will be very happy because Generic_Name is a good teacher and probably would've given an assignment that he would consider ""too hard."" Instead, Generic_Name will now go home and take 20 minutes to write about Spongebobs marine life and get an easy A. This will not benefit Generic_Name in any way, shape, or form because Generic_Name took 20 minutes out of 9 weeks to write about non-sense he knows will be an easy A. Therefore, teachers should assign projects in order to assure that students are actually putting their brains to work over the summer.

Another reason students should not design their own summer projects is because many of them will go home thinking they have plenty of time to complete a simple project. This will lead to procrastination and many students will end up forgetting they had a project to do. For the students who procrastinate this will teach them bad habits and for the ones who forget and didn't do it, it will not benefit them at all. By letting students design their own projects in a 9 weeks time span, teachers are opening the doors to bad habits their students may learn. Therefore, teachers should assign these summer projects in order to keep students away from learning bad habits.

In addition, students should not design their own summer projects because teachers know exactly what the students need to learn. The teacher should choose something important, that's not too easy, and that will help the students out in the long run. For example, If Generic_Name assigns Generic_Name to 3 essays about Oceanography , Generic_Name may not be happy, but it will help him a lot years down the road. When Generic_Name gets to 11th grade he will be an essay master, he will get an A in English class, he will score a 600 on his writing SOL, and he will even be an excellent Oceanographer! Generic_Name will look back and be so grateful that Generic_Name gave him that assignment that he hated so much. Generic_Name will now realize that importance of having good projects assigned by qualified people. Teachers should assign summer projects to their classes in order to help them learn useful information that will help them throughout their lives.

In conclusion, it is best to let teachers do their jobs and be the ones to decide on the summer projects. It is always interesting to see what different students choose for their projects, but the most beneficial to students would be the teacher-designed projects. For students it may not be fun but it is what's best for them and it will surely help them a lot more than the easy projects that they would have much rather chosen. Teacher-designed projects is the way to go!                  ",5,Summer projects,Independent
76DC969AB5A0,"Have you ever had to do summer projects during summer break? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects.

Some people say summer projects should be teacher-designed because it would help them practice for topics that would be discussed the next school year. However, summer projects should be student-designed because students could be more creative with what they do. For example, when a teacher assigns you a project the set their projects to be something specific like: show a graph, create a drawing of this, and/or write a essay about this. When there are limited options like this, students that struggle at something like drawing could be put at a disadvantage and not grade as high as other students. Thats why if summer projects are student-designed students would be able to show off the talents they have and be more creative with what they present as their summer project.

Secondly, summer projects should be student-designed because student can go at their own pace. For example, some projects could require students to do something that they dont understand and therefore they wouldn't be able to complete their project. However, if summer projects would be student-designed the students would be able to complete the project because they could do something that they know how to do and its at their own learning pace and they could also help teacher know what a student struggles at and what they know really well.

Finally, summer projects should be student-designed because students would be more inclined to do complete their project. For example, one of the reasons many student don't complete their projects is because they think that the projects are too boring or are too hard. However, if the students get to choose what they are going to turn in as their summer project then they would do projects that they think are fun or aren't too hard and many more students would turn in their projects.

In conclusion, summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects. For these reasons, I implore teachers to allow summer projects to be student-designed.",4,Summer projects,Independent
FAE3AC62234D,"Summer break is a long three months away from school for students to relax, learn new skills and enjoy themselves. Most students tend to forget everything they are taught throughout the school year over this break. Summer break to majority of students is time for having the best time of their lives doing all the things they love which hardly ever includes academic work. Teacher-designed summer projects would be a very effective way to ensure students keep receiving knowledge throughout their summer break because education is a continuous process. Teachers would be the best choice to design these summer projects because they thoroughly know the syllabus of the course they teach, they would give realistic projects students can complete on time and teachers would be fair in selecting the type and criteria of the project.

Teachers have all the information about the courses they teach and what their students need to know each year. Teacher-designed projects would entail the necessary topics and lessons for students to work on during their summer break. Other people might argue that the students are also well informed about what they are being taught so should create their own summer projects but most students might just have an idea about what they need to know but might not know about the course in detail as much as the teacher does with all their years of experience and trying new approaches to figure out what works best for their students. Students might also just want to create projects that would be very easy to complete just so they can get it over with. At the end of the day if students are allowed to create their own projects they end up learning nothing new because it was based on stuff they already knew. For example a Geometry teacher teaching tenth graders would not create a math project for tenth grade students based on sixth grade math because that is way below them.

With teacher designed-projects they are more likely to have realistic amount of work and would be possible for students to complete and meet the goal at the end of the break, teachers would most definitely not give too much work to overburden students since they also need some rest or too little work to students but give them just enough work for the break. But if student-designed projects are used students are more likely to create very short and straight to the point projects because most students are lazy and just do not want to be bothered with any work so would not want to challenge themselves to research and do more but would want very few questions that would not need any serious thinking and application of knowledge. A teacher who teaches a 12th grade English class could give a summer project for students to read and summarize a book of their choice and find out the meanings of 20 new words in the book but students would have probably wanted a project where they just write out ten new words from the book they read.

Every student always wants the easy way out of everything so if allowed to create a summer project would just create a project based on what they are very good at for example; a project with artwork, a crossword puzzle or a project about their own sentences and this would lead to a disagreement among the students to pick the best project which would be good for everyone. However, a teacher would not be biased in choosing a summer project for their students, they would assign a project based on skills all their students are expected to know or already have without picking out what some particular people would want in that class.

Ultimately, teachers know the best approaches and methods when it comes to projects for their students because they have worked with many different students over the years and came up with very effective teacher-designed summer projects to help their students keep learning over the break without stressing them.                                           ",5,Summer projects,Independent
6AF5A10AFF5A,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed. I believe summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be more involved in what there learning and it also allows students to learn at there own speed and level.

My first reason on why summer projects should be student-designed is that it allows the student to be more involved in what there learning. For example if a student receives a summer project from he or she's teacher it's highly likely that the project will be focused on everything that the student has learned before the summer. But what if the student dose not need to learn everything what if they only need to focus on certain thing that they are struggling with that's why I believe that student-designed projects would benefit students better; because it give them the opertuntitie to create a project that can focus on things that they are struggling with and improve upon it.

Another reason I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it allows students learn at there own speed and level. I personally believe that the summer projects that are given to student are pretty challenging and a lot of students and because of this a lot of student either decides not to do the project or they cheat and end up not learning anything; thats why I feel so strongly that student should be allowed to choose and designed there own projects i believe this will help students learn without being overwhelmed or overly challenged. On the other hand teacher may feel that if they designed the projects that it will be better for students and they also may feel that overly challenging students is a good thing because it put students in a position to challenge themselves and to learn at a higher level; and while statement has a point I still have to disagree because while its true that some students may benefit from this there are still a lot of students who wont I believe that a student my first master the level that there at now in order to proceed into a higher level of education.

These are all the reasons i believe summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be more involved in what there learning and it also allows students to learn at there own speed and level.   ",4,Summer projects,Independent
D8DBF197A624,"Summer break. The most sought after break by any student at any level. Days spent by the pool, hours of hanging with friends, and nights that run into the morning. Summer is where all knowledge learned during the previous year goes down the drain. To counter this, teachers assign summer projects. These projects are normally easy but require much time. Summer projects should be teacher designed because they prepare the student for the next year, the teacher knows what is being taught, and it gives the student a baseline of what he or she knows.

Summer projects are designed by a teacher that the student will have next year. These projects need to incorporate what will happen in the upcoming year. Many first units include what was included in the summer project. Summer projects help student get ready for the new year by giving students an easy, slow paced, and minimal effort project that will help students in the long run. These projects are often worth points and can boost grades when quarters or semesters are ending.

Teachers know what is being taught for the next year. They can design the assignment to reflect what will happen. Students can't do that. They don't know what is going to be taught or how the teacher teaches. If a student were to design the project, they would make it have little to no relation to the upcoming class. Students during the summer are lazy, I speak from experience, and the last thing they want to do is school work. When they design their own work, it is sloppy; lazy; and unrelated to the class.

Lastly, the summer project gives an honest and unbiased evaluation of what the student already knows and what they don't know. The assignment is students' first test, and students can give themselves an honest evaluation of themselves. How much did I have to Google? Did I ask my friends for help? How long did it take me? These are all questions that they can ask themselves. These questions and project will show how much work they will need to put in during the school year.

Some might say that students can prepare themselves better for the school year than the teacher can. They don't need to have the teacher to assign them work. The weakness in that argument is that students are over confident in their abilities on what the know and don't know. As a student in high school, I constantly believe that I am smarter than I truly am. Students will think they know more than they really do and will already be behind before the school year starts.

Teachers design these projects to help and prepare the student. It gives an honest evaluation of students' abilities and knowledge. More teachers should assign summer projects to keep students' brains engaged. This helps them prepare for the next year while also seeing what the teacher wants. The teacher knows the subject better than the student; teachers should assign summer projects not students. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
22416450E0EF,"Summer break is the biggest part of the year that students look forward to. Students want to have fun with friends and just relax, however, students are still required to continue learning throughout their break in order to retain information they've learned over the school year. Consequently, students are assigned teacher-designed summer projects. Some people may say that teacher-designed summer projects are effective, however, student-designed projects are better because it would be more enjoyable for the students and it will have more diverse topics.

First of all, having students design their own projects would be a lot more enjoyable for students because they have the freedom to choose their own topics. For example, the famous filmmaker and entrepreneur Walt Disney was not always successful with his work. At the start of his career he drew little art work pieces for a small local newspaper company, although he wasn't able to profit from his drawings that much, he still loved his job because it was something he wanted and loved to do. It can be seen that people are able to go through tough times if they are able to express themselves freely. Another example would be is when my science class was assigned a group project and students had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do. My group decided to do it on climate change, which wasn't very appealing to me at the time, but as I learned and dug in deeper into the topic, I found it more and more interesting which led to me being more educated in climate change and gaining new knowledge made it was more memorable. This shows that when students have the freedom to choose and design their own projects; it helps students learn something they never knew about, which leads to students being more educated.

Secondly, letting students design their projects will lead to more diverse topics. Students are always taught to follow a rubric which can be stressful; consequently, students are limited when it comes to expressing their thoughts and opinions. In fact, during my English class, students were split into groups and we were all assigned the same topic to debate about and we were also assigned which side to take on the topic. This lead to students being confused and frustrated because they didn't know what to talk about because they didn't agree with what they were assigned, which lead to the debate being very confusing and vague; students from all groups were stating the same basic reasonings with no interesting details. It can be seen that it's hard to describe or discuss about certain topics when there's no diversity of thoughts. On the other hand, during my history class, the whole class held a debate on a topic where students were given the choice to pick which side they wanted to take. As a result, students from both sides were able to share their thoughts and opinions on the topics, which led to students from both sides giving diverse, different, and interesting ideas and students were able to learn from each other. Every person is different and everyone has different thoughts that people can learn from one another.

Some say that teacher-designed projects are better because teachers are more experienced and know what's better for the students, however, that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that every student is different and some students need more freedom in education. For example, studies have shown that when students are given work that's confusing or not enjoyable; they procrastinate until the due date and the scores and grades are often lower. However, when students are given the opportunity to choose their own topics and work on what they want to do, they take more responsibility and complete the task on time with a higher score. Teachers being more experienced than students may be true, but giving students a chance and letting them work on their own may show better results. Often times, students are too focused on grades and rubrics, which can be stressful and upsetting when they receive a bad grade for their work they thought was good, however, when students follow their own rules and knowledge it'll be more rewarding when they receive a good grade and it'll be easier for students to find what they lack and need to work on, to improve when they receive a bad grade.

In conclusion, students should have the freedom to choose and design their own summer projects because it'll give the students a chance freely express themselves. Students today have a lot of information thrown at them during the school year and having to retain all that information throughout summer is very difficult, but having students forcefully research and learn about a topic they don't like would be very discouraging and not very effective. Learning is an important part of life, but students should still have the freedom to research and work on something they want to do. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
B15DCC651E2D,"Although many teachers designing their own summer projects for the students, the students should be designing their own summer projects. Students they chose their own topic and design their own project will be more interested in what they are learning. Also the students would be more likely to actually do the project if it is something they have interest in, and the students would have more say in what they are learning if they got to design their own summer project.

If students were allowed to design their own project they would be a lot more likely to actually do the project. Most students rather be with friends or on vacation during summer, rather then staying inside and working on a paper for school in two months. If the student designed the project it would be something that they might actually want to do or find interesting, not just something they were told they had to do the last day of school for that year. I know when I'm on vacation I like to do what I want to do and not be followed around by all the school I have to get done. So if it feels less like school work and more like a project that you want to do in your free time the students might actually do it.

Letting the student have a say in the design of their project helps them get more involved with their learning and education. If you just et a teacher tell them what to do they will get bored with learning and not be interested and learning new things, but if they got a say in them project they could get involved and actually enjoy learning. I know from my life experiences I had a lot more fun learning when I had a say in what I got to learn, such as me joining the Fire Department. When I joined it was a lot of self assigning tasks and learning on your own time and at your own pace. When I got the chance to work with the people that where teaching me and have a say in what I learned and when I got a lot more into what I was learning and applied myself a lot more then I usually do in school.

A student is way ore likely to do a project that actually interests him or her. A teacher can just pick a random topic without even thinking if the students will find it interesting. If the student is not interested in the topic it just makes it that much harder for them to pay attention and stay focused on the topic. When you are forced to learn about something that doesn't interest you it is harder to learn that topic. You have to do it all the time in schools such SOL's. You learn about something in school that does not interest you so the state will give you a label of smart or not smart even if you are just not interested in the random topics they pick to say they have taught you something. If it is a project that is to be done over summer vacation, let it be something that the student might actually enjoy and want to do. The student can easily just blow of the project and then start the next year in a bad spot because he or she is already behind on the first day of school and that is setting them up for failure for the rest of the year.

Although teachers liking to design their summer projects for the students, the students should design their summer project. Have the project follows certain guide lines so it is still some what attached to what the students learned in school. Having the students get involved with their education is good for a lot more than just school, it can help them in the real world too. Students would learn more about something that might interest them if the student designs their own project. ",5,Summer projects,Independent

There is an ongoing debate if these summer projects should be teacher- designed or student- designed. Those that disagree state it's easier on yourself and brings out your own ideas and creativity, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be teacher- designed.

There are a variety of reasons why summer projects should be teacher- designed. The teacher can challenge the students. For example, if I was assigned a project where I can pick my own topic I wouldn't do a lot to where it's hard work. Furthermore, the teacher can also prepare you for next year and do the topic about something you're going to learn about. Doing a project of my own choice of topic wouldn't help me next year. Also, it lets the teacher see who can do it and who needs more time and help. Every year is different and working on a project designed by the teacher can help you get ready.

There are further reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. One reason is to have a topic to the subject. Doing a project about my favorite song wouldn't help me with science. A teacher- designed project can also better your work. When your teacher assign a project about a topic your going to learn next year, you will already know about it because you did a project on it. Lastly, doing summer projects prepare your brain for school. Over the summer you can forget things and having a teacher- designed project can help remember.

Although some may disagree, summer projects should be teacher- designed. This is the case due to better work, prepare you for next year, and challenge students. Those who disagree state it's easier on yourself and bring out your own ideas and creativity, but this is not true. This topic is important because it shows how some schools do better than other schools when they do summer projects. It makes other schools want to prepare their students for their upcoming year.",3,Summer projects,Independent

As students get older, more teachers assign summer projects to insure that the students are prepared for the following school year. However, in many instances, students are not engaged in what they are learning. Summer projects should be a collaborative effort between both the student and the teacher to insure that all students and teachers feel like they are heard and grow along the way.

Teachers need to be a part of designing summer projects in order to maintain the level of learning and to stay on topic. With teachers contributing to the project, they are able to steer projects down a certain path in order to make sure that the students are getting what they should be out of it. By including teachers into the project building, they make sure that what the students are doing is educational along with reasonable for the class and that the students aren't trying to give themselves minimal amounts or work. For instance, many English teachers make their students read books over the summer and reflect on the book itself. This gives students an individualized opportunity to advance and excel as they get to follow along with what a teacher, a specialist in a specific field, knows about a topic while applying it out on their own.

Students should be a part of the summer project process in order to not only have a more leadership and engaging role, but to also insure that they are learning about something that they are interested in. Multiple reports and experiments done, such as one on

Brain Games , shows that kids have a more creative mind. In a specific clip of a

Brain Games experiment, adults and children were asked to come up with as many pictures or figures as they could with a ball and two sticks. The children more than doubled the amount of images that the adults did. This shows the creativity that students have, and applying that to a lesson will help make the lesson more intriguing for young minds. Students generally like projects that give them a creative boost; for instance, when teachers say they can present something in any way that they want. And allowing students and teachers to work on designing summer projects together keeps the projects civil and in range, but also gives it the opportunity for it to be fun and creative.

In addition, including students in the development of summer projects benefits them and the rest of their classmates. If a child is given a book, they may read it, or they may not. However, if a child gets to pick out a book, they are much more likely to be attached to it and feel the urge to read it, as it is theirs . The same thing applies to students of all ages. If students help design the summer projects, it allows them an opportunity to get attached to something and to take pride in something. In many cases, this causes people to work harder and care more about what they are doing, rather than just taking it for a grain of salt and moving along.

When dealing with students and teachers working together, some might say that there then is an unfair advantage to those who designed the project when it comes time to grading. The solution to this, though, is that it is not that teacher that is grading the projects. When students move on to the next grade level, they have a new teacher. So if a 10th grade student is helping design their summer project, it will be graded by their 11th grade teacher, therefore eliminating any bias. Another solution to this problem is to have students create the summer project for the class that they were in at the time. For instance, a 10th grader could help design a project for the rising 10th graders, thus eliminating any bias along with allowing them to see what they liked about the previous project and make any changes that they think are necessary.

Finally, both parties are equally vital to summer projects because apart from getting a better education, it teaches students and teachers to work together on issues and education, which is something that is hard to find throughout the school year. Throughout the normal school year, teachers are seen as the authority figure with all of the power in the classroom setting. Although that is true in a way, having students and teachers collaborate on projects opens up a door for them to share ideas, as most students feel their ideas on a normal basis are sub-par and often times don't end up sharing them. It helps bridge the gap between teachers and students, allowing them to be more trusting while also gaining respect for one another. By allowing this collaboration, students will be able to see the hard work that teachers put into lessons and such and might end up appreciating it more, while teachers may gain a clearer insight on how students think after working with students.

It is evident that both students and teachers should design summer projects for the students in order to get the best quality work out of the project itself along with helping them both grow as people. By allowing this crossover bridge for students and teachers, it helps the education system grow as a whole and offers both teachers and students an opportunity for growth, and growth is what the education system and teaching is all about.",5,Summer projects,Independent
386F96C2DCE1,"Often times, students disagree with and frown upon summer assignments, despite them helping to maintain their own educational growth. Many schools call for students to do projects over the summer to assure that they both have learned, and will continue to learn over the break. These summer projects should be designed by teachers, ensuring that: students actually learn something, students are being challenged, and that students' stress isn't piled up by them designing their own assignments.

Teacher designed summer projects are needed because, if actually completed, they guarantee that the student will retain new information. Although not over-break assignments, DECA projects, which are designed by DECA executives, have produced countless intelligent people that can solve real world problems with ease. DECA is a national organization in which peers compete against one another through the creation of business solutions projects. Many students who have participated in DECA and have solved these types of issues,either come out of secondary education feeling confident about economics, or actually go into the business field. Projects like these teach students how to use whatever they are learning, in a non-classroom environment, ultimately boosting student growth.

Assignments to be completed over the break are not meant to take away from the summer experience, but to challenge children enough to maintain and grow their educational ability. This purpose of summer assignments, is best suited by teacher modeling, because this presents a greater challenge to students. Some might argue that by students modeling their own projects, they are able to challenge themselves a great deal, without going over their personal limit. However, many young people will actually take advantage of being able to design their own assignments. For example, in my honors science classes, we would always have a year long, Science Symposium Assignment. In these assignments, me and a partner would design our own experiment and create a final trifold explaining the processes. Me and my partner always came up with the baseline knowledge experiments, so that we could earn a good grade without challenging ourselves. To this day, I do not recall the conclusions of those experiments, persuading me to believe if the teacher adminstered our project topics, we would have learned more.

Students who are assigned such large projects are typically already stressed about the fact that they have to complete the project. Allowing the students to design their own projects would greatly increase their stress levels as they now remotely have two seperate assignments. My father, who is in the Army Special Forces, was once faced with this issue. As the leader of his team, he was instructed to find out where they would carry out a home invasion and how they would carry out the invasion. Normally, he would have already been told where to do it, and would just have to figure out how to do it. This put a lot of stress on him at this time, and actually led to a failed mission because his stress levels trumped is intelligence. Having to design your own methods for carrying out an assignment is detrimental to the outcome, for all types of people, especially students.

Schools administering assignments similar to these, should be very cautious as to how they want the products to be done. It should definitley be made a priority that all projects are innovated by teachers in order to assure that the students are learning, reduce students' stress as much as possible, and to challenge and hold students accountable.                  ",5,Summer projects,Independent
CAD0AF209830,"Projects of any kind are often dreaded by most students, especially summer projects. Since some schools require these projects, the least they can do is make them student-designed. While there is less of a chance of the project being innapropriate or something easily put together last minute if it is teacher designed, it takes away so much of the students creative freedom. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows them to do their project on something they are passionate about, they are given more creative freedom, and their classmates can learn new things instead of everyone doing their project on the same topic.

With the load of school, extracurriculars, and homework students do not have nearly enough time to do things they are passionate about. Allowing students to pick their own summer project would give them the opportunity to learn more about something they love and get a grade on it. Additionally, if the project is about something that a student does not feel any sort of emotion towards, chances are, the student will not take as much time making it a great project because they do not care about the subject.

When a student completes a project outside of school it could be a variety of things. It could be a painting, a clay pot, or even a table. All of those things require the student to be creative and make it their own. School projects should somewhat resemble these projects. Students should at the very least be given a chance to use their own creative skills to make the project their own, instead of them being given a list of things to include in a powerpoint. If the students' were allowed to pick their own summer projects they would have so much creative freedom to really do the best they could on their project and make it something they are proud of.

Say there are around thirty kids in a class, and every kid has to present a project on the same topic. That is the same information rephrased thirty times, and that is over three class periods of sitting through essentially the same project thirty times. That is not something students would enjoy, and it is difficult to image that teachers enjoy sittting through all of those projects. Although, if every student in that class is allowed to pick their own topic that is thirty new topics that students in that class could learn about. Some of those topics might even peak other students' interests and they might try something new.

In summary, summer projects should be student-designed because they can do a project on something they are passionate about, they are given more creative freedom, and their classmates can learn something new. These projects need to be student-designed or they will continue to be insufferable projects to do and sit through that are dreaded and procrastinated throughout the entire summer.",4,Summer projects,Independent
C04A90A73B3D,"The answer is so astoundingly obvious, the projects should be student-designed.

I believe that the projects students are required to do over the smmer should be student-design rather than teacher-designed for countless reasons.

It is less work for the teachers them selves.

Students would be allowed to work on their creative mind.

Students become more inclined to do them this way.

First of all is a simple reason that it is less work for the teachers.

Instructors already have plenty of work to do over the summer, some teach summer school and have to grade papers. Even teachers that do not teach summer school still have plenty of work to do like getting ready for the next school year.

On top of that they have their own adult homes lives to deal with.

When you add more work like planning a summer project for all your students to do and maybe even having to come up with multiple, I feel that is not necessary.

The next argument I propose is that the students will be able to express their creativity.

The projects teachers give out are, nine times out of ten, not exciting at all, mostly boring.

When students are able to come up with their own projects it gives us a sense of creativiy as well as making it more enjoyable.

We can put our interests into the project: gaming, anime, reading, sports, hiking, fishing, etc. It also gives us a sense of ownership over the entire thing rather than it being another boring, school issued, manditory assignment.

My final act of persuasion will be that students would be more inclined to do the projects.

Summer is a time we don't want to think about school, it is a 3 month time period we can sit back and relax or focus on more important things than if our homework is done.

Students tend to wait till the last minute and sometimes not do them at all.

While, yes, some people may say, ""They could do the project anyway over summer if it's something they want to do whether it's issued or not so why have it be school issued.""

That is where you are wrong, you see, kids around my age such as thirteen to eighteen are known to be gargantuate procrastinaters.

We may want to do something over the summer and might find it cool but more than likely we won't end up doing it.

If the subject at hand is required then we would have the drive to actually do it rather than loiter, and since we crated it and find interest in it we would most likely do the project early on and efficiently.

In conclusion to this exactly three thousand charcater persuasive essay, I believe that the projects students are required to do over the smmer should be student-design rather than teacher-designed.

It gives instructors less work.

Students get to express their creativity and interests.

Students would be motived and have more push to do the project. It is assenine to think otherwise since my argument is astronomically superior to any arguement that could be mustered for the projects to be teacher-designed. With all of this being said I say farwell.",4,Summer projects,Independent
9127434E8CF8,"Planning a summer project can be a difficult task for anyone. However, for school summer projects, teachers should be the ones to plan out a summer project for the students. Teacher's have been proven to more knowledgeable then their younger counterparts. Teachers are just overall more knowledgeable about how to teach their students.

In order for teachers to better prepare their students for their class; a summer project is best left to the teachers to plan out. The reason being that teachers should have a pretty good idea of they should be teaching for that year's education. Centering the project on what teachers will be teaching; would better help understand where their students stand on certain subjects of that class. Not to mention, teachers also have more experience in what students should be learning because at one point they were students themselves.

Being a teacher most certainly means that teachers have gone through learning experiences that they thought had gone well, or maybe had thought classes could have been taught using better methods. Teachers can then apply what they have learned from previous learning experiences ,and either take or improve upon them.

Then, we have the most obvious reason why student shouldn't come up with their own summer projects. Student have time and again proven that they push off or be become lazy doing certain tasks. This may not be the case for all student, however it is the majority. Another reason why students may not be able or be good at planning projects, is because they may be simply to busy doing other activities. Some example of these activities are sports, having a job, visiting collages, or planning out what they want to do for a career. Students may just simply not have enough time to plan out what they want to do for a project; where as for a teacher. It is their job to plan out what students should be doing in or for their classes.

Those are the reasons on why teachers are better equipped to plan out summer projects and not students. Teacher's can pull from previous learning experiences to apply to how they want to teach students. Students could outright just be lazy or to busy to plan out assignments. Then the obvious fact that teachers have just learned more ways because they are older.",4,Summer projects,Independent
E497A489CA82,"The Summer Project

Summer projects are often popular to help assure that students are still learning throughout their break. What many people can not agree on is whether they should be student or teacher designed. Either way it is still providing knowledge to be gained during this time period, but by students designing them a better outcome should be seen overall.

As seen so many times before, kids do not want to do school work in the summer; which is why they are typically so excited for break. Allowing them to create their own project leaves room for creativity and imagination. Creativity is put into place because they can take whatever they want , with some guidelines from the teacher of course, and turn it into something nobody has ever seen before. The internet is so handy and has the answers to almost everything now, children can just look up ways to do the project if teachers design it. Therefore, they are not really learning anything, just changing some things around enough in another's work, so that it is not plagiarism.

Summer plans could get in the way as well. Some kids go away all summer or are working, as well as playing sports. With this being their time to relax they are not going to want to do a project that they did not come up with or might not be interested in. If they do create it, they can make it about their summer or something to do within their summer plans. That way, it is not such an inconvenience. With the project being more wrapped into their summer it could also make it easier for them, provide better grades, as well as the understanding of a subject.

Teachers have specific curriculum that they have to teach every year. Depending on how their schedules are laid out. Such as, class all year around or just one semester of that specific class, can provide a crunch time. More often then not, the class does not finish up all the curriculum. If the teacher provides a project over the summer to ensure that the students learn what they need to before school starts, there is less crunch time and stress off both the teacher and students shoulders. By designing the project they can ensure that the children gain the knowledge that they need and are prepared to jump ahead on the first day back to school. A set topic and guidelines can allow for easier and quicker grading for the teacher. Just because a project is done the correct way, does not always mean that whoever completed it truly understands and can grasp that topic. Cheating is often done in times like this because nobody wants to do a boring teacher designed project during summer break.

For better understanding, grades, more effort, and happier students, summer project should not only be student-designed but come with certain guidelines from the teacher. By creating their own work, it allows for the students to get interested and learn about the topic well. Although, it will not always be easy for them, it can provide better outcomes in the end. Their knowledge is what we should be concerned about, what promotes that more and that is what has to be thought about when arguing this topic. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
717DA64D319B,"When the word summer comes to teenagers' minds, fun or sun is a common thought. Summer vacation is time away from education, but many schools require completion of projects over the break. The purpose of projects is to assure the continuation of learning. In order for students to maintain increasing growth, schools must consider the best form of education over the long-awaited break. There is controversy over whether summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. For the best form of educational progression, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have more experience, the projects have more structure, and academic performance increases.

Many people would argue that student-designed projects would appeal to other students better. Teenagers gravitate towards making friends through shared interests and ideas. Although the shared bond of age may seem like a reason for students to understand each other, everybody is unique in his or her own mind. The student that designed a summer project for a whole class may find that assignment more interesting than the others do. There is no guarantee of appeal for everyone in the class because of the various personality types in the world. Student-designed projects focus on what the creator is interested in, while teacher-designed projects tend to think of what interests the majority of students. Educators have been exposed to the different personalities they have taught, so they have an idea of what would equally appeal a class as a whole.

For the creation of a summer project, teachers have more experience with a wide-range of students. Whenever teenagers attend school, their objective is to achieve an academic diploma while maintaining a social life. They have not considered how all of their peers think and learn. Teachers are trained to create lesson plans that suit most of the students in a school. All educators need to obtain a degree before they can go into the workplace. Most of them have completed a course of psychology or sociology to better understand the behaviors of young adults. With years of experience academically and in the workplace, teacher are more likely to succeed in creating a project that fits a majority of students.

Teacher-designed summer projects would have more structure for an easier learning experience. Along with academic and behavioral experience, teachers need organizational skills. They are well-adapted to a learning environment and have a multitude of deadlines each week. Educators become more aware of the average pace an assignment can be completed within a variety of students, which leads to a better determination of the workload for a summer project. Also, teachers are given a curriculum for a course at the beginning of each year from the school board. They can take into account what pupils need to know to be prepared for the following course. The information learned inside each course can be adjusted for what teachers think will help students succeed in future academics, while allowing teenagers to complete assignments at a reasonable pace.

An increase in academic progression occurs when projects are teacher-designed. Educational performance in students holds a high level of importance as statistics are recorded then reviewed each year. Schools are constantly looking for strategies of improvement. Teachers have access to more resources that can be provided for completion of the project, while student-designed projects solely rely on the creator's background knowledge of the subject or research online that may not be as reliable. The success rate increases for learners as the projects utilize the information needed in the future, rather than excess knowledge that is not useful. An expansion of achievements requires teacher format rather than student creation.

The making of teacher-designed projects improves academics as the experience level is higher in teachers, assignments contain more organization, and success increases within students. Teachers have workplace experience with different types of behaviors, so they can create a project that will interest many students. Also, educators plan out a reasonable workload for students to complete while including entertainment. With the high amount of knowledge and resources teachers have, students can reach a greater potential of educational progression. Teachers are the most selfless people as their career is to help others grow without much incentive. When people advocate to maximize educators' training and experience, by having them design assignments, it will assist society in building a better future for later generations.",6,Summer projects,Independent
413AF04AE970,"Would you rather want a teacher-designed summer project or would you rather design your own summer project?

Well In my opinion I think summer projects should be a teacher-designed because It can be easier for kids and more kids would most likely complete their projects faster.

Having a teacher-designed project can be very easier for kids who dont like doing any work. For example, some people are really lazy and just need a little push, so If any teacher consider doing a teacher-designed project It will give the kids the push they need to completing their project. Even though kids like to complain alot maybe this would stop them from complaining and actually finish there project, you also can get a good grade.

Another reason to having a teacher-designed project will be more kids will be able to complete their projects faster. For example, I dont like doing projects because It take me to long to complete, I will probably miss the dead line to turn It in,and even though Its my design It takes time. If my teacher was helping me In some type of way I would complete my project faster,turn It In on the dead line, and get a good grade on It.

Some people say that student-designed projects can get you thinking or you can be creative. However It will take you way longer to complete. For example, If I was doing a project I would have to think about what I wanted to do and get my supplies that I would need, but If it was a teacher-designed project all I would have to do Is get the supplies I needed to complete the project.

In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by your teacher because it can be easier and more kids will complete their projects faster.

F38992AEE65A,"Many schools require students to complete summer projects or assignments over summer break to ensure that they continue to learn during their break. In this case the projects that are assigned over break should be student designed because students are more likely to do them, they can design something outside of the classroom, and will learn skills from designing their own projects.

Firstly, if summer homework is assigned students are not likely to begin that homework until school is right around the corner again; at the point the only purpose the homework has is to refresh the students' memory. However, if projects are put in place of homework then the student will be more likely to start earlier in the summer. Additionally, if students design their own projects then they will instantly be more likely to do them, especially if they are allowed to pick a topic that interests them. For instance, at Generic_School there is one notorious class that gives summer homework. The way the teacher incentivizes doing the homework is by having a quiz within the first week of school on the summer homework. This is an unproductive way of going about this because the student now has a boring textbook that he must trudge through, plus if the student has high anxiety then they will worry the whole summer effectively making their ""break"" useless. If the teacher was to let the students pick a topic within chemistry and then research on their own then students wouldn't stress because they can pick a topic that truly interests them. Continuing with this example there are many subjects within chemistry that would be interesting to students such as chromotagraphy or the way molecules react to temperatures, reactivity in water, etc. Students would be more productive or excited and less worried about their summer project.

Another possible benefit from letting students design their own projects is that they could choose something that is not traditionally taught within their core classes. The student would still be learning even if they are not planning on taking that class or is currently taking it. A student from the Generic_School was able to design and test an experiment while working for UVA over the summer. The student's project was about testing the effects of bacteria on a certain type of plant, yet the same student has not taken AP Biology and does not intend to do so in his senior year. When students design their projects they would be able to be creative and come up with something that would be relevant to their own interests. The projects could also force them to build connects in the world as they search for a place to conduct their experiment or resources that would help them. Students could reach out to places like UVA or research facilities or teachers in the school that they don't have for knowledge about their project.

Finally, many people worry that if students are allowed to create their own projects then they would be completely pointless, or have no benefit. That worry is not necessarily true; even if the students' project does not have a real world application or a use as soon as they finish, the project still has value. Designing and completing these projects show students what it is like to go through this process from start to end. No matter what the outcome of the project is it still serves it's primary function; to keep kids learning over the summer. Some of the most famous science experiments don't work, these help future scientists decipher what will work. If students need to continue to learn over the summer it should be in a free way, this way students are allowed to explore options they might consider going into after school but don't have the opportunity to pursue during school. Students also need a break, they need time to relax and not worry about school that way they can come back refreshed.

Schools that require summer projects to be done should allow their students to use their creativity and choose a project that interests them, even if the subject isn't one of their classes. Student designed projects would lead to a higher completion rate,a broader span of subjects within projects, and whatever the outcome the student would learn skills to help them in the future. In the end, schools that let students design their projects would see a continuance in learning over the summer ensuring the main reason for assigning a project in the first place. Students keep learning during their break.",6,Summer projects,Independent
664DC178A65E,"Have you ever had to do a project over the summer for school. Well some schools have it as a requirement to do a project over the summer break. The project that is assigned by the school should be teacher designed. This is because when the students comeback to school there teachers design the projects that are given. Teachers know the specifc steps the students need to use to make sure they have the right information they need to get a good grade, and what information they are required to have on their projects. Also the teacher can design it around something the students do on a daily bases on summer break.

First reason the teachers should design it because they design all the projects when the students comeback to school from summer break. I say this because the teachers are always making the plans, and creating the way the projects are done. This is shown when they give you a project they create those plans and requirements. It also shows where you can find the information about the subject that the project is on. The biggest thing about the teachers designing the project is that it is involved in what you are learning in the class that you have the project in.

The second reason on why the teachers should design the projects is they know what information the students need to have on their projects. Also what specifc ways they can get the information without violating the rules of the projects. This is because students have access to all type information through the internet and other sources, but some sources are not correct. Websites on the internet are a prime example of getting false information, which could lead to getting a horrible grade on the project that is assigned. Also the teachers know the websites that are vaild because they go in and look through them carefully.

Finally the teachers can design the project around something the students do everyday on summer break. This is because they know studnets on summer break are not going to do reading or writing a paper. So they just make it something easy like recored the weather for a two whole weeks. They also could make you track how long you sleep a day for a whole week.

That is why teachers should design the summer break project. It is because they are going to have to make the projects when the sutudents comeback. ",3,Summer projects,Independent
3F142A739C54,"Imagine you were forced to work on a topic you hated.

Although it gives the students a chance to slack on the project, i think students should be allowed to design their own projects because it gives them a chance to be creative, it's something positive for them to do, and they will always be learning.

The students have a chance to be creative and have fun with the project. It gives them an opportunity to pick something they really love learning about and it helps the teacher get to know them better.

They're most likely to put a lot more effort into the project. For example, you were just assigned a project and the topic on it was something you absolutely hated you're not going to want to do the project or put much effort in it and you're going to get bored with it.

It's something positive for students to do during the summer. Kids are more likely to get into trouble whether it's because of boredom or they just like it them designing the project will give them something positive to do it'll keep them out of trouble and they'll have fun doing it. For example, one of the students i know likes to ride bikes everywhere even when he isn't allowed to and that gets him in a lot of trouble so one day i took him to the library and we read books and built action figures and he didn't get into any more trouble after that so sometimes all students need is something positive in their life and this project is just the thing they need.

The students will always be learning. Them designing their own project is an amazing idea because it gives them the chance to be responsible and make desisons on their own. They would have to use their brain to create and complete the project all by themselves. Just because school is out doesn't mean the students stop learning the summer is all about growing and maturing and them creating their own project is a great way to start. For example, one if my close friends won a price for one of her many great projects and she had to give a speech and in her speech she said "" This project has made more responsible and has taught me so much about myself and i hope i inspire everyone to go out and be creative.""

However, some students are required to complete summer projects to make sure the knowledge that they have attained from those nine or ten months of school doesn't leak out of their brains. This is not a bad thing because it allows for teachers to know what they should focus on for the new year when these students come back. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because the summer projects will be graded by teachers, teachers already have the knowledge about the curriculum, and students will be too lazy to want to design a project for their summer.

Summer projects should be designed by teachers because, in the end, teachers are going to be the ones grading it. Grading things, often, take a lot of time from teachers. However, the time it takes to grade could change by the subject that the teacher is grading.

For example, a math teacher could take two or three days to grade all of their students' math tests. On the other hand, English teachers could take a week to a month to grade essays for all of their students. Projects take a long to do because the purpose is to see what the student knows overall and allow them learn things they didn't know before. Teachers are going to grade these projects at the beginning of the year, but they are also expected to begin teaching students new information of the course and grade other things assigned to put in the grade for first quarter. It would be stressful for the teacher if the students were able to design a project that would barely passed the minimum effort expected or if the students design a project that far and beyond. It would be a chaos for teachers to grade. Therefore, teachers should be able to design a project that they believe would allow them to efficiently grade at a faster pace.

The people that should design the summer assignments are the people that know the subject of the summer projects the best and those people are teachers. It easy to say that designing a project is easy. However, it's difficult to find the resources and plan out a project that would effectively help new students learn the information they need for the new year. It will be difficult for new students to make a project on what they don't know. Teachers, on the other hand, know about the subject and the important things that students should focus on. They know websites, videos, movies, documents, or other resources that are helpful to students. For example, I had an AP United States summer project that I had to do in the summer of 2019. The teacher give us YouTube links to watch from and made us practice how to write different types of essays. The project wasn't boring. It taught people a lot of useful skills by allowing them to watch videos and reading sources. I learned a lot of things that I didn't know before. This example shows that teachers already have the information to make a good summer project that allows new students to learn effectively.

Honestly, students are too lazy to want to design a project. If a student is too lazy to do a summer project, why would they want to make a summer project that will be source of their suffering and anxiety for the summer? For example, I had an English book that I was suppose to read in the summer of 2018. I did not even read a page in that chosen book. It was the easiest summer project ever and I was too lazy to even do that. Students want to have fun during their summer. They don't want to design a project for their summer. People could argue that designing a project is fun or if a student designed a summer project then they could make it be easy. However, the project will never be truly ""student-designed' because teachers and schools will have a requirement of what is suppose to be on the project that students will be designing. Also, summer projects are for new students. These new students know nothing to very little information about the new subject that they will be taking for the upcoming year. If teachers or the school expects students to do research on the subject to make their summer project. They might as well just make their own summer project because either way the student is gonna be force to learn something new. It will only be more work for the student to design a project for the summer that they will have little information about or they won't even be able to do it because they won't be in the class next year.

In conclusion, teachers should be the ones designing summer projects because they know the most about the subject, they're going to grade these projects, and students are too lazy to design a project. People can argue that a student can still design a summer project and make it enjoyable, even with teachers' requirements. However, it would be so difficult for teachers and students because teachers will be forced to make requirements of what should be on the summer project and be forced to see if the summer project is effective. Students will be forced to make a summer project for new students and not for them because they're going to move to a different grade or subject the next year. Unless new students are making it. However if new students make it, they won't even know what are the important things that should be on the project or how to most effectively gather the information. It'll be too difficult, therefore teachers should just design the projects themselves.",5,Summer projects,Independent
BF8BD3F4C67E,"Many schools require students to complete summer projects in order to keep them learning over the break. These projects are usually teacher-designed and are assigned to the students at the end of the year. Some students argue that these projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed since it is taking up their summer fun time, but many disagree. Summer projects should continue to be teacher-designed because students will receive a premade rubric, projects are likely to be more organized, and projects can still be based off the students liking.

Some will argue that summer projects should be student-designed due to the fact that it is taking place during the students summer free time. Students want to be able to create the project themselves so then they can create it how they want to create it but that makes grading very difficult for teachers. Letting students design summer projects also has a high risk of unorganitzation because students may have the mentality that they can do whatever they want and still receive a good grade. If students do what their teachers tell them to do, then they will already know what to do from the beginning.

Most teachers and parents would agree that a rubric should be given to the students for them to follow while completing projects. Rubrics allow students to have a guideline to follow while completing their projects, essentially making the projects easier. Rubrics also give students a checklist that helps them stay on track and makes sure they are getting everything done that they need to get done in order to get a good grade. If students created their own rubrics, that would make grading projects extremely difficult for the teachers and most students do not understand how hard it is to actually create a rubric. Therefor, rubrics should always be given out by the teachers.

If summer projects continue to be teacher-designed, then students are more likely to be more organized with their project. Students will have gotten an explanation on how to complete their project and will have been informed in a way everyone understands on how to complete the project to the best of their abilities. Organization is key when completing projects and the best way to stay organized is to allow the teachers send students on the right track. Most students to not think about how easy it is to become unorganized and turn a great project into a ball of confusion. They need the teachers help to make sure they do the project right.

Summer projects may be teacher-designed but that does not mean they can not be based off of the students opinions and liking. Students can still receive a rubric and be told what to do and still have a high level of creativity involved in their project. Before school comes to an end, teachers can ask the students what they want to do most. having that information allows teachers to create a project that is easy for them to grade and is still fun and enjoyable for the students who are doing the project. A big factor in school projects is making something that the students can be happy and proud of and not something that they forced themselves to finish and are unhappy with. In order to keep both teachers and students happy, summer projects should continue to be teacher-designed.

Once summer starts, students become independent and are on their own with the project they are assigned with. That is why they should be given a guideline on how to complete their project, ways to stay organized, but they should still be able to complete their project with a smile on their faces. If summer projects stay teacher-based, then all three points can be addressed and improved upon. Students may believe that they can do everything by themselves but they will never succeed without a teachers help from the beginning.",4,Summer projects,Independent
BDC47D47817A,"Summer vacation is a time for students to relax from all the work and stress associated with school. Teachers assign arduous assignments and projects that requires many hours to complete. Should summer projects be teacher -designed or student -designed? Summer projects should be student designed because students will be more inclined to do the project, student projects are unique and it is a good experience for the youth.

Students will be more intrigued by projects created by their peers. Projects assigned by teachers are often dull and pointless. Having seen many projects assigned by adults, students understand the basis of a quality project idea. Peer designed projects are often more fun, as it was created by a young creative mind. Students will be more interested in taking part in student -designed projects over the summer.

Student -designed projects are very unique, as they have participated in numerous projects. Teachers assign multiple projects per class in a given year. Students often find teacher -designed projects to be useless and is seen as busy work. Peers understand what a creative and helpful project consists of. Summer projects should be fun and easy because students worked hard all year. Student -designed projects would be relaxed and more unique.

Teacher -designed projects are often complex with multiple segments. Students look forward to a relaxing summer, as they worked very hard during the school year. School creates lots of stress and students often lose hours of sleep. Projects designed by teachers could be more beneficial to learning, but will intrude on the students time off. Stress is the last thing students need during their summer break.

Summer projects designed by students will be beneficial to both the student and teacher. Designing a project is a good experience for kids to have, as it helps with creativity and leadership. Summer projects should be student designed because students will be more inclined to do the project and student projects are very unique. ",3,Summer projects,Independent
45B6B3734D1F,"Most schools require some kind of work for students to do over the course of the summer outside of school. Usually, these assignments are to keep topics fresh in the minds of the students so that they can retain the information for the coming school year. These assignments do refresh the student on the topics that they have learned; however, the students rarely apply themselves to these assignments. Students do not see a point to these assignments because they don't think of the long term benefits of these assignments as the cause for their success in school. I think that these summer assignments should be designed by teachers so that they cover the necessary topics, but take into account the students requests as well. These summer assignments designed by teachers are critical because it helps the student succeed, saves time, and promotes learning.

If students were allowed to be completely in control of their summer work, they would chose one of three things: not to do it, do only the topics they are comfortable with, or chose something they are actually interested in. Most students will opt for not doing these assignments and having the summer for themselves. However, when the students arrive back at school, not having done any work to prepare for the school year, the teachers will have to take time in class to reteach everything that was learned in the previous year. These summer assignments are difficult, but they without-a-doubt help a student succeed. Personally, when I was given an optional summer assignments, I did not complete it and I struggled immensely with the curriculum until I took the time to actually review the material. I have no doubt that if I had done that summer assignment I would have had a much better start to the year. With this option available to students to ""self-design,"" the students will not properly prepare themselves as much as teachers will, and therefore will not succeed as much.

When summer assignments are given, it allows for students to refresh themselves on the topics that they had learned previously, and perhaps new topics that they will be covering in the coming year. This allows for the teachers to briefly cover what was learned previously and then move on to new topics. If teachers didn't design the summer assignment, then these topics would have to be reviewed in class before starting any new topics. This makes the first few weeks of the school year even more chaotic because every teacher will have to speed through each of the topics necessary for the curriculum in order to make up that time.

Also, when students learn some of the topics before coming to school, it helps the teacher get though the topics quicker by not having to explain as much. When the students do not have the summer assignments designed by the teacher, they do not learn the new topics, and therefore have to spend more time on them in class. For example, most classes have summer assignments so that they can avoid having to review a bunch of material before learning the new curriculum. Given these points, teacher-designed summer assignments are critical to save time for the new information to be covered during the year.

Finally, these summer assignments promote independent learning for students. They teach students how to find information and time management, which are necessary skills for college and future careers. Research based summer assignments are valuable to learning because they are flexible in the structuring but also cover the topics necessary. If a teacher told students to write a short essay to summarize a few topics that they have learned or are interested in learning about, the students will apply themselves more than having to write out ten pages of notes on a book. This type of summer assignment requires actual thinking and creativity from a student. When a student is given fifty math problems they have done before, they learn nothing, but when given twenty and a small creativity based project, they will actually fully apply themselves to the work. This will also cause students to not resent the work that they are doing and hopefully cause for a better school year to come.

For these reasons I agree that there should be teacher-designed summer assignments, but I also believe that they should be more engaging and interesting for students so that they apply themselves and retain the information. The summer assignments that the teachers assign now are not engaging in the least and cause the students to dread having to come back to school. I think that the core topics that need to be reviewed should be given by the teacher, but that the teacher should allow for the students to work creatively on part of the assignment, this may cause for less dread by the students. With these types of assignments, both the teachers and students can be successful during the coming school year. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
9BA405DDDF7A,"Schools require summer projects to benefit your learning outside of school. I think that sudents would be more engaged, creative, and interested in topics that they can decide.

Students should be able to design their own projects to be more engaged in the topics. Depending on the class, they would be able to relate something they enjoy, or are passionate about, to learn more about the school project topic. For example, if you have a summer english project for a book report, students could choose a book that they're interested in,and enjoy reading, instead of something they're not interested in, students would be more engaged and creative about the project because of their book choice.

Students would benefit from the freedom of designing their topics, because if they're interested in the topic they chose, their grades might improve because of their engagement to the topic. Students would be able to relate what they're learning about their chosen topic, into a much more creative way to express themselves. If you're able to decide the format of your own project, for example, you could create art, a book, or use the internet to create something that you're passionate about. Instead of having set boundaries by teachers, you could have more freedom to design, and express yourself through your topic.

Students should have the freedom of designing their summer projects, students would be able to learn more about their topic of interest, be more engaged, and be able to get creative about their format of the project. Students should be able to do projects that interest them, and benefit their learning better, instead of teacher-designed projects that have strict boundaires, and have to be in correct format for the assigned project. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
EFF2F345EFA5,"I along with other students, hate summer projects especially when a teacher designs it. As you can already tell i'm against teacher designed projects, and here is why.

When a teacher designs a summer project or any project in that matter it can be very uninteresting, which increases the chance that a student would just forget about the project or put in a low effort. Teachers these days give out more online work than paper, and anything online can be easily forgotten. Due to the fact that its online means that students would have to stay inside and not do what they've planned for the summer. Some students work efficiently if its on paper rather than a computer. What i'm trying to say here is that summer projects should not be designed by teachers.

A big reason why students should be the designers is because that teachers lack something the fresh minds of young students have. That something is creativity, believe it or not creativity can get you far in life and it even makes school work a lot easier and fun. Doing anything in the same old fashioned traditional way can be tiresome and repetitive ,but doing work or anything can be a lot more enjoyable and easy if you think of a creative way to do it. There is no reason at all a student should not be able to complete a project they designed themselves.

Now I know some people think teacher designed summer projects are more direct and easy to follow this is false because if you make the project you know all the steps and how to follow them.

In conclusion students should be the ones designing summer projects not teachers.",3,Summer projects,Independent
D8708AEA9667,"Although in theory a student-designed project sound good, in practice the students will most likely struggle to make the project because of lack of understanding the project. This is why a teacher-designed project would be beneficial because it would be more thought out, leave a clear outline of what to do in the project and have more structure then say a student designed project.

When you're a teenager you want to be free as possible but sometimes you are too free, that you don't know what to do with this much freedom so you do nothing.

In this sense the project that would be designed by a student most student would have no idea where to start discouraging them for even commencing the project and of course there will be people that can do the project easily but we want to make the project fair and equal for everybody.

This is why a teacher-designed project would be best because it would leave a outline of what the project is about, What you will create, how you will do it and what criteria you have to meet to have your project pass leaving it fair and equal for everybody or another solution to this problem is that it could be the students choice if he/she want to design the project or take the teacher-design project

In conclusion a teacher-designed project would be the best option for this summer project because it would let the teacher outline certain thing they want in the project to ensure that the students are still learning over the summer break.",2,Summer projects,Independent
BFA9F9B90BFB,"Why is it important for the teachers to assign summer projects during the long summer break? It is important for the teacher to assign summer projects during long summer break, because it is assures that; the students continues learning during the summer break. Summer break is a long break where students usually forget what they did and studied last year. So, it is better to for the teachers to assign summer projects, so the students can come better prepared and ready for the classes after a long summer break. Teacher- designed projects are usually school appropriate, focuses more on the main idea, and easy for the teachers to grade the assignment.

Teacher- designed projects helps the students to focus on the main idea. It does not distract the students to go off the topic and focus more on what teacher wants and expects from us. It is also helps the students to full-fill the teachers requirement, for example; In the future, it would help the college students because they would be more prepared and ready for it. College professors usually assign really hard projects so it would be hard and difficult for the students to do. They also wants us to not go off topic because they don't like students giving extra information that is useless. If students have multiple choices to work on, they usually get confused and don't know what topic is best for them to choose. It gets really hard for the students if they make their own choices so it is better for the teacher to assign or design a project that has been approved by the teachers department.

Grading projects for the professor/ teachers is an easy task if the students chose to do the projects that they have assigned. If the students choose to design/ create the project on their own. It would be kind of hard for the teachers to grade the assignment. They might get confused on what the actual topic is and would not get a good grade unless you have enough information for the teacher to understand. For example, during the end of the sophomore year we got a research project to do to get a GPA

boost. In order, to get the GPA boost I needed to do good on the research assignment. Me and my partner chose a topic that was not a teacher's choice topic and it was about testing goldfish in different water levels. The teacher told us that it would be a hard topic to choose as she did this sort of assignment during the college days before becoming a teacher. We both still chose to do it and took a risk, in the end most of the goldfish died during the experiment and our research assignment didn't went that well as we thought it would be. Me and my partner didn't receive a good grade, we got a B- on the research project. After that I decided to always choose a topic that has been assigned by the teacher because they already been more experienced and chose what is easy for us to do. This year research assignment is assigned by our teacher and it is much more easier for us to do as it is assigned by the teacher and until now we have been getting good grades and just waiting for the final part to complete. It is better to always listen to your teachers point of view because it might help you in the future and you might end with a good grade, even you get your teacher's guidance for the project.

Teachers- designed projects are usually checked by the academies of Generic_School or the head of the teachers department to assure that it is school prohibited. Projects should be school appropriate because students usually choose topics that might not be appropriate for schools. Teachers/ professors knows best what school assignments are appropriate and what are not. If the project is not school appropriate, you might get a straight zero in your grade book and a comment written, it was not a school appropriate project that's why your kid got a zero on your report card. Student-designed project can be easy for them unless, it is school appropriate and meet the certain requirements that has been provided by the teacher. For example, in the show ''the vampire diaries"", Generic_Name chose to do an assignment for a history project. It was about the witches and vampires and how they were created and how many are there. This was not a school appropriate project for a high school student to research about this kind of topic. So he received a zero on this assignment. Generic_Name teacher talked to him about the project and gave him a second chance to do a topic that is related to history.

In conclusion, teacher- designed projects are best for the students because it would help the students to focus more on what criteria to meet and what are our teacher's expectations. It would be much more easier for the teacher to grade and help us on the assignment that she has designed for us. Teacher would assign or create a project that would be useful for us in the future and might help us in many ways. Teacher creates an assignment that is school appropriate because if it is not school appropriate then you'll straight get a zero on the assignment. Teacher chooses the topic are easier and helpful in way for their students. Teachers assignments can sometimes be really hard and too difficult at times that you might get confused on what information to put and what not to. Though, some of the school requires the teacher's to design a project not the student's because it is out of schools law because if they do something wrong, the teacher gets into trouble. Teachers should give summer assignments to the students during summer break because it is very long break and children usually forget. So the teacher creates these assignments for the students to relearn and get more knowledge through projects that might help them in future or their career. However, I think that teachers should be the one designing the projects because it keeps the teacher assure that students are learning important information that might be helpful in their future.",5,Summer projects,Independent
41B00C33B8AE,"Whether students and teachers like it or not, some schools require students to still learn over their summer breaks. One way that these students have to learn is through projects. These projects should be teacher-designed instead of student designed for many different reasons. Although students can be smart, they are not experts on the field that the project would be based on, so for a better chance of more accurate learning, students should leave the project designing for their teachers. Teachers are also the ones who create the lesson plans, so they know what students need to know for the course, making them better candidates for creating the projects than students are. Lastly, student-designed projects can be harder to grade than teacher-designed projects. For these reasons, students should not be forced to create summer projects for their peers; the job of being a teacher should be left for the teachers.

Not every single student in every single class is at the mastery level of a topic. Kids who have a 99% over all for the class still do not know everything that their is to know about a specific subject. Teachers on the other hand go to school for the subject they want to teach and teach the same class repeatedly. This lets them specialize in what they teach and have constant reminders about how to do what needs to be done for the subject. These years of experience that teachers have in their field should not be wasted by letting students design projects. Students often make mistakes, and other students should not have to learn how to do these mistakes simply because a student designed a project rather than the teacher, a professional in the field.

Students are not the ones who design and follow lesson plans for their academic courses. Teachers are the ones who make the lesson plans and know which materials students are responsible for knowing and not knowing as well. Since these teachers know what students need to learn and the point of these summer projects is simply for learning, this is another reason why students should not be designing these projects. Making a students who does not know the entire course layout of the class or the time period in which each subject in the class needs to be learned makes this task to heavy to put only on students. Students who have not created an entire lesson plan based on what needs to be taught and learned throughout the year should not be forced to then come up with a summer based project to teach their peers, when they do not even know what needs to be taught in what specific time period.

Finally, student-made projects could have more potential grading complications that teacher-made projects. Students still not fully having mastered the subject if left to grade might incorrectly mark another students project since they do not fully understand the subject themselves. Also if a student is the one responsible for grading, they may overlook or even correct their friends projects simply to help them get a better grade or to not feel the guilt that comes with marking off something of you friend's work. On the other hand, if teachers are the ones grading student-designed projects, there is the chance that teachers will not understand the student's rubric that they created or there is even a chance that the teachers will not even understand what the students are hoping to accomplish through the project(s) that they have created. To keep grading accurate and fair, teachers should be the ones to both design and grade these summer projects.

There are too many complications that come with making students design projects for their peers. Students are not experts on the subjects, so making them create projects over professionals in the subject is not fair to the students or their peers who need these summer projects to learn from. These students are also not the ones who make lesson plans, so they do not know what should be taught in what amount of time. Lastly, for grading fairness, it is better to have teachers be the ones to design and grade these summer projects. Although the idea of letting students create these projects for their peers can be fun and help with their learning of the subject, there are too many other avoidable complications that can be solved by leaving teachers to be the ones in charge of these projects. Teachers should be the ones doing the jobs of teaching, not students.         ",5,Summer projects,Independent
DD4953261FCD,"The project should be student-designed for various reasons. Children of any age have very creative minds and that could be very good when it comes to this project. Being that it is a summer project, it would be a lot easier on the students to make the project student-designed. A lot of children have jobs or get jobs in the summer so it would be better on those kids and others to have a self-designed project. The project being student-designed would cause students to pick their strongest topics, get more creative, and manage their time properly.

Students should be able to plan their own projects. If the students were able to plan the project, they could pick a topic they felt they were strong in. Having a teacher pick your theme or topic could be very hard if you were not strong on the topic they picked. For example, a teacher assigns a project on the solar system and that child doesn't know much about it, it's not going to be a A+ project. The student knows a lot about Albert Einstein, but he could not pick his own topic. Student-designed would result to better grades. A self-designed project would let the teacher know how her students think and what they feel they are strong in.

Also, you could get more creative when the project is self designed. When you come up with an idea by yourself it makes the project well put together. Students would be able to incorporate all their true colors, true feelings, and lots of meaning into this project. You have no limits when you are designing something that you feel strongly about. For example, with a teacher-designed project you have limits such as a certain amount of words, color, and size. For some students those kind of rules are hard to follow because they want to express their inner self.

Lastly, making the project student designed would result to better grades and finished products. Students would know how much time everything takes to get done and they would not be rushed. Not having a rushed project would result to more passing grades. Students would be more comfortable presenting because they know their projects does not look have to look like everyone's project. They would also let people know how they think by the amount of color, drawings, and length of the project.

In conclusion, it would be a good idea to make the project self-designed. Students have a different mind set from everyone else, so it would be a good way to see how each one thinks. Having a student-designed project could benefit both the teacher and the student in many ways. The teacher could learn a lot about the school year ahead of her and what kind of students she going to have. And students would find their inner selves and natural talent without even knowing. The project should be an student-designed project because students could pick their strongest topics, get more creative, and manage their time properly. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
5C0A85EEEDDD,"Do you believe it's fair for students to choose whatever project they want? Students shouldn't be able to choose their own project, because they could be choosing the easiest one or the least amount of work. They could also be doing something they've already done, so they wouldn't be learning anything new. Although some might agree otherwise, personal experiences, other students, and teachers prove that students should not be choosing their summer projects. .

For example, personal experiences, I've learned more stuff through teacher designed summer projects. When I was assigned a book to read over summer, I thought it would be boring and I wouldn't be able to finish it. The type of book that I had to read was not my type, but I ended up loving it and was interested in finishing it. If my teacher didn't assign this project to me I would have never found out I was interested in these types of books and I would have never learned some things not only from the book, but about me. Some may disagree with this, but teacher designed summer projects help students be more responsible and get them to learn more information.

Shown through other students, some take advantage of teachers who give them a student designed project and they choose something they really know and don't have to learn anything new. Some students don't like to learn anything or do anything related to school and they end up choosing the easiest way out of that school work. In this case those students who didn't want to learn anything end up with less knowledge then others in their class. By giving the whole class the same summer project, they will be all on the same page next year when they go over it and everyone will understand.

Lastly teachers, they all have a different mind set, so every teacher teaches differently. A teacher could be letting their student's do anything they want for a project in class, out of class, or for summer. If one does do that, some student's may have a hard time and some may like it better that way and if they do the students may have a different amount of work on the projects which wouldn't be fair to them. Some may say otherwise; however, a teacher designed summer project will help the students learn and help the be able to work on their own. This will also help they get ready for work, so they would be able to do things on their own.

This is important because some teachers don't think it affects students, but most of the time it does, students may take advantage with teachers providing a student designed summer project. When a student was able to choose all of their past summer projects and then one year they can't choose it. They would struggle and wouldn't have a teacher to help them because it's summer time. If a student is able to choose their projects all the time they wouldn't be learning anything new. This explains why student's shouldn't shouldn't be able to choose their summer projects shown through personal experiences, other students, and teachers. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
B803E3E11DD0,"There are some schools that require students to complete a summer project to assure they're learning while they're on break. Usually, the teachers design what they want their students to do. Some people disagree with the idea of summer projects being teacher-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because it shows creativity, benefits the teacher, and students are more likely to do it.

When students are able to design their own projects, students get to be as creative as they want. Every student is different and have their own ideas. These ideas shouldn't be limited to a boring project that everyone else is doing. This also shows individuality. They're able to express who they are in their projects. This allows their classmates get to know them.

These projects can be very beneficial to teachers. It also allows their teacher get to know them as a person. Teachers work with many students everyday, and new students every year. By making these projects student-designed, the teacher will know what type of kids they'll have. This also allows teachers to get to know them as a student. All kids work different and learn different than others. With this, teachers can look at this, and know who needs help with what, who's doing just fine, and who's exceeding.

Most students are not big fans of summer projects. If students get the opportunity to design their own project, they'll be more excited about it. When teachers assign a project, students just see it as extra work to do while they're supposed to be on break. Most kids forget about it, stress all summer about it, or don't do it at all. When they get to design their own they won't forget or not do it because it will be something they want to do. They also won't be stress out all summer about something they'll enjoy and have fun doing.

Some schools require students to complete a summer project. Most of these projects are designed by the teachers. There is still a debate on whether these projects should me teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because it shows creativity, benefits the teacher, and students are more likely to do it.",4,Summer projects,Independent
F44662214D2B,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. There is an interesting debate around this topic. Some people believe that the teacher should be the one to design these summer projects. other people believe that the students should design their own summer project. Teachers should be the ones to design these summer projects because they are the ones who know what is going to help the students get prepared for the next school year.

Teachers are much more responsible than their students which makes them better candidates for designing summer projects. Teachers are more mature than their students. Teachers know what the students are going to need for the future. Teachers would know what would be the best thing to do for their students. Teachers overall are best choice when debating weather or not they should be the ones to design summer projects.

Some people may still argue that students should be the ones to create their own summer projects because of reasons like, ""It's their summer project, let them do what they want"", or, ""They should get to choose how they want to learn over the summer"". While their may be some ground behind these claims, giving free choice to students like this is like giving a car to a child. They don't know what they are doing and it's just going to hurt them. These students could also rig the system in their favor and make it so easy that they don't need to learn anything, therefor, making the point of the summer project entirely pointless.

Ultimately the greatest and smartest choice to make in this situation would be to just let the professionals do their job so that the student get what they need. Students just need to do what they are given so that they may get the best outcome out of all of this.",3,Summer projects,Independent
AE8385F10D82,"We as people get dumb, it's true, over a period of time we get dumber. To counter-act this problem schools started to assign projects over the summer to keep student learning. When I was in high school we had a huge summer break project, thankfully in my case it was a group project, but what was interesting is that our teacher asked if we, the students, design the project or if the teachers do. Some may believe that it would be better to let the students design these, but it's better if the teachers do because you will get good practice, you dont have to do work designing it, and it will help you in the future.

One reason why teachers should design these summer projects is because you would get good practice. After a long break I sometimes have trouble getting the mindset ready to learn again, I often don't pay attention after a break because I am still in that kind of mind set. If teachers assign these projects, with their ideas, it would help me get ready for the school year. It is better for the teachers to design these instead of the students because they hand out good hard working projects, if students made these I fear they would make it too easy so they can get it over and done with.

One other reason why teachers should design summer projects is because, well so they have to make it and we don't. I am going to be honest, nobody likes to do a summer project, they may be helpful but they are boring, so why should students waste more time designing the projects, then have to do the actual thing. It would be better for the teachers to make these so students don't waste more working time designing these. If teachers made the project then the students can give their full attention into completing it, not creating it. For example, when I had to do a summer project, I had the luxury of focusing only working on the project; while my friend, who goes to a different school, had to design their own. He told me that it was harder because he worked hard designing it and got really tired just from designing.

One final reason why teachers should design summer projects is that it will help you in the long run. For me, I was one of the top workers because in my job they require you to work at all times, even during your breaks. Thanks to school, with my teacher giving me a summer project, since they designed the project, it was a good hard working one made my an adult. This helped me practice doing projects over breaks so I was able to do well in the future. Again, if students made this they would most likely make the projects easy. If students made things easy for themselves, it wont help them in the future. If their future job required them to work all the time, they would struggle at first because they made it too easy for themselves and their job would want them to do adult level work.

Some might say that letting the students design summer projects is the right option; however, it is better to let the teachers make them because you would get good practice, you don't have to waste time designing the project, and it will help you in the future.",4,Summer projects,Independent
D99A8FDB17D8,"Some schools require its students to complete summer assignments, this raises the question of whether these projects should be teacher-designed or students-designed? Which would be more beneficial to both the educator and the learner? Students would better benefit from completing an assignment structured by teachers because they have received an education on how to teach adolescents, understand where a student needs to be in their learning, and allow the individual to explore a subject that they previously didn't know about.

Summer assignments should be teacher-structured for many reasons, one of them being that the teachers have been educated on student learning. Before even being able to become an educator, teachers have to complete an education of their own; where they learn the most beneficial way to help another person understand something. Compared to an adolescent, who most likely isn't thinking the same way, it is clear that one will have much more success than the other in getting the lesson through. One is focused on how to get the point across as efficiently as possible and the other simply doesn't have the same thought process. The vigorous work done to obtain a teaching degree also ensure that those who are taught under the educator are not put in a stressful situation, learn at a comfortable speed, and are challenged just enough. Proving that teacher-designed assignments guarantee not only that the individual is learning, but learning effectively.

Another reason that proves why teacher-designed summer projects are more efficient is that the teacher better understands where a students is in their learning and where they should be by what time. For example, more experienced educators have seen quite a lot of different students with different learning patters and know how to manipulate that to the benefit of the student and themselves. This trait is most useful in a situation that the students in a class are in completely different areas in their understanding. The teacher is then able to build projects that are unique to each individual's strengths and weaknesses. Which consequently allows the class to collectively reach the same high level of understanding, all while working individually.

It is impossible for a student to design an project about a topic that they dont' already know about. Teachers should be the one's structuring the summer assignment because they are able to give the learner an unknown topic that could even possibly interest them. A student-designed project serves no purpose in assuring that a student will continue learning, but only review materials that they have already learned. Giving teachers control over the project prompts the student to research unfamiliar topics and further educate themselves. This small, but important change in the project designer completely decides whether a student will go on with a solid understanding of the class or forget the only half of the material that they learned.

Although one could argue that student-designed summer assignment have their own benefits the better option are teacher-designed assignments. These summer projects are better structured because the teachers have received and education on how to teach adolescents, they understand where a student needs to be in their learning, and allow the individual to explore a subject that they previously didn't know about. This structure is also beneficial because it doesn't allow the student to create anything that isn't challenging and even makes it easier on the teacher with grading. For these reasons, summer assignments should be designed by teachers and not the students.",5,Summer projects,Independent
2ACA19551483,"Year round school and better understanding in school for the next year? Oh Yeah. With a summer project then you remember more as you have to use the knowledge that you've gained and put it to use. Whether it be teacher-designed or student-designed is up for debate, as there are ups and downs for either choice. To teach students something new, to remind them of past subjects or to help direct the students to their ideal subject in college. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it is easier to teach something new, students don't forget what they learned previously and it makes the students think creatively.

If the teacher makes the summer project design then they can help students learn something new while they are out of school. The teacher giving the new information can have guide lines for what they need to know to complete the project, or to get a student ahead for the next year leading to a better year for both the student and future teacher. Not only would the student be able to learn something new, but they would also be able to use that new found knowledge in an efficient way. For example, then when I was in sixth grade then my parents took me out of public school and put me into home schooling. I would go onto a website that was used for teaching people from K-12th grade everything that they would need to know. I would do this from when I was taken out of school to the first year of middle school, and my knowledge and understanding of the subjects that we were learning was at the point were I wasn't the odd ball in the class. With that part of the year and during the summer when not only was I able to catch up in subjects that I was a few grades lower in, but I was a level higher then everyone else for a while.

With teachers designing the summer project then students don't have to worry about it as much because they don't have to waste the time deciding what to do for the project all summer. Not only would the students be given a benefit from using the knowledge given to them, but they also get to finish it in almost half the time that they would have needed if they were to choose the project as well. There are a lot of friends that I know who can't decide on a certain subject for a project until it is either the night before it is due or the day off. They are very stressed out when this happens which leads to them failing in other classes as the extra stress from that one class is distracting them from the others.

Another benefit is that the student actually has to go out of their comfort zone, or they will stay in it, if the subject or the needed information is in a subject/ topic they like or dislike. Forcing a student to work on something that they don't understand is something that could help them understand it, and as they have to get a understanding before they can use it or they will not understand it and never get any better on the subject; making the student more creative in their methods for learning and for when they overcome harder challenges in life. For Example, they might get into a rut at a job that they have and it is getting difficult to keep going. Well if they are creative thinkers then an idea might pop into their head which could lead to them getting out of the rut and to a much happier life.

In conclusion, then if a teacher either from the last year or the next year will be able to help the students understanding grow. Although, some people think that the teacher shouldn't be the one to design it, but in fact the student, because it gives them a free choice on what to do, they have more fun doing it as it might be a subject they are interested in, and they might be able to grow in their field of experiences that interests them. It still could lead to students not doing the summer project at all because they might not be able to decide until the very last moment or not at all. If a teacher or teachers design the summer project then their is a lower chance that the student will forget information from the last year. Along with, the project being a challenge that could benefit both the student and the future teachers in the long term, with the student having a better understanding of the subject and/or the concept.",5,Summer projects,Independent
233F34A737E9,"Some schools require many projects over the summer. Reasons for this may vary, but they all share one thing in common; Who designs these projects? Schools often bring this idea into thought as they switch their deigns of these projects year to year. In fact, students often wonder why this is the case. I believe school summer projects should be consistent and always be designed by a teacher because it creates an equal learning objective, strong motivation from a teacher, and help and guidance on making sure a project is done correctly.

With student deigned projects, students often do not meet their set learning objective of their class. Some students gain the objective and learn,but some fail and do not meet the objective because they learn a different topic. Because of this, students should follow a teacher designed project to create an equal learning environment, ensuring all students learn the same learning material. Summer projects are meant to help students continue learning during a break, without a certain objective being designed by a teacher, students often will no achieve the meaning of a summer project.

Over a long break, many students do not have strong motivation to complete and learn a project. Whether it is because a student is confused or doesn't have good management, Students often find themselves in need of greater help from teachers as a way to successfully learn from a project. In school, teachers are often seen as great influences in the classroom, ensuring greatness from each and every student. However, at home, students often are not kept at the same standards of learning. With teacher designed projects, this would create a vast way for students to become motivated and successful, in order to follow their teachers project.

Help is often hard to find at home. Many students do not have great resources at home. For example, parents often cannot answer questions about a school project, due to their lack of knowledge of the classroom. With a teacher being the designer for a school summer project, students have a reliable resource for help on what to do. This guidance from a reliable resource makes summer project much easier for a student, as they would have a teacher to help them succeed in a set project.

While teacher-designed projects have set rules and can be seen as useful, student-designed projects can also be seen as helpful, as they can give a student freedom on what to do and how to do it. Student-designed projects do not hold a student back from doing a project a certain way, as every student learns differently. However, I still believe all summer projects should be designed by a teacher to assure great continual learning during a break. Teacher-deigned projects create a strong learning objective, a great source of motivation, and strong help and guidance for all students to follow. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
BC37046CC03C,"If teachers set guidelines and standards for how they want their students projects to look, then their students would put more effort and energy into fulfilling those standards and guidelines. Student would be more efficient in order to accomplish what the project should be and what the project should actually look like to the teacher.

However to some students it may be better to design a project based off of how they would want the project to look and how they want their project setup instead of what teacher would want. This would give the teacher the opportunity to see what the student is capable of doing on their own. This option would represent what the students have actually learned over their break. It also will reflect how the students take it upon themselves to show what they know in a creative way based off of the projects topic.

However, student-designed projects would lead to some students not putting as much effort and creativity in their projects. Students will do the bare-minimum when they have the option to take it upon themselves to do an assignment for school. Some students may take it upon themselves to go above and beyond for their student-designed project. However some students may take advantage and use it as an opportunity to be lazy and unproductive on this assignment.

Students would not have as much motivation if they have the option to take it upon themselves to create a project over their summer break. If this assignment was left up to students to design their own projects some would not take it as serious as should and some would. The students who won't take it as serious as they should would have an unorganized project or they just wouldn't do the project at all.

A benefit of summer projects being teacher-designed would be the fact that all students had one layout or structure for how their projects are supposed to be. It would be easier for the teachers to grade and look over all projects efficiently. It would also be easier for the students to follow an assigned rubric or setup for a project. Instead of designing it on their own

Teacher-designed project would be easier for students because they know what the teacher expects their project to be like in order to get a good grade on it. This will make the students projects way more neat and organized. Therefore summer break projects should be teacher-designed to be more efficient, organized, and helpful for both students and teachers",4,Summer projects,Independent
C18D0CE31987,"Summer is a time period students dream about throughout the school year. It is the promise of complete freedom from the academic cycle they grow exhausted of over time. While summer project assignments may be dreaded by some to inhibit them during their months of freedom, these assignments have the long term benefit of continuing to engage student minds. Teacher-designed summer projects guide students to continue learning effective content based on the educators' experience, and though more demanding than student-designed projects, ultimately prepares them for the future.

Unlike students, who have no experience in teaching a course, teachers have the knowledge to assign projects that not only directly relate to the classwork, but specifically assist students in mentally preparing for the rigor and content of the coming year. Teachers have firsthand experience in assigning projects, as well as knowledge gained through formal training to receive their teaching certification. Specifically, they know how their class will be lead and therefore have the deepest understanding of what content would be most effectively to learn or review over the summer. The time students spend on teacher-designed summer projects would assist their position in the class even before the academic year has begun. Oppositely, student-designed projects have the potential issue of being mere busy work, meant to be simple to complete yet not informed by the actual course, and subsequently a poor use of students' time and effort. Teacher-designed summer projects are guaranteed to be effective in enhancing student learning, as they are lead by the educators themselves.

Teacher-designed summer projects have the educational advantage of being assigned directly by the leader of the course. This then gives students the advantage of getting to know their future teacher's expectations for the class and the content they are expected to know. This may lead to lessened student anxiety surrounding beginning a new school year by providing them with a sample of coursework. Summer projects may involve a rubric for scoring, as they often do for academic year assignments. This allows students to have teacher expectations written out for them so that they can mentally prepare for the coming year at their own pace. Summer projects designed by teachers may also mirror an assessment that will be given the first week or two of school. A practice test, for instance, gives students firsthand experience in what questions will be asked. This knowledge of the class, direct from the educator, provides students with concrete practice and will lower stress surrounding the unknown of the coming academic year.

Summer projects designed by teachers are likely to be more intensive than student-driven projects. But this prepares students for the reality of their futures, in which they must independently weigh work, leisure, and socialization to reach a balance for contentment and success. Students and parents may be concerned about the potential inundation of schoolwork during the promised free period of summer break. Yet, the promise of months of vacation from work is not reflective of students' lives after graduation. In the workforce, much more often then not vacations are not guaranteed. Vacation days must be earned or built up over time, and the employee must additionally consider the effect of losing that time at their occupation. The working world, the adult world, does not slow in the summer. Teachers, understanding the scope of their courses, will tailor summer projects to be educationally effective, which likely will mean more intensive work, but work which will improve student performance in the coming year. While the project itself is not student-driven, students have control in how they plan to complete the assignment. Teacher-designed summer projects mirror the students' future careers, in which the work is assigned but they have the independence to balance work with choice activities.

Teacher-designed summer projects provide students with the opportunity to use time over the summer to efficiently prepare for the course and develop skills regarding balance of work and play. Student-designed projects would not reflect the content of the course adequately, and a student-designed system does not prepare students for their lives after graduation, in which they will be expected to manage work given to them by authorities and balance their other activities. Teacher-designed summer projects have the major benefit of preparing students in both the short term and long term.",5,Summer projects,Independent
5356F912E48A,"In Koea, there is a old saying that says ""Don't catch the fish for the kids, but teach them how to catch it."" It means challenging itself is the only way to improve and it is better for people to learn for themselves instead of getting help on everything from other people. Some schools reuquire summer project for students during the break. Some teachers design the projects for their students, but some let their students to design them. Hoever, the summer projects should be student-designed for students' creativity and remembering the content.

First, the summer projects should be student-designed because it helps the students to improve their creativity. When students design their own unique project, they have to come up with personal idea to imply on the project. Since they need their own idea, students have to think more about the theme, content, type of project, and all the things that they might want to put in the project. This process helps the students to think a lot deeper than teachers giving specific directions which helps to improve their creativity.

Second, the summer projects should be student-designed becuase it helps the students to remember the learnings. When students design their own project, they need to remember and understand what they have learned during the school year well enough to evaluate into a project. It requires them to think about the contents for a long time and go through the notes or text books for informations. This process helps the students to reorganize the informations in their brain which eventually allows them to have longer memory on the learnings.

However, even though student-designed summer projects help students to improve creativity and remember the content, there might be people who does not agree with this statement. Some might say that it takes too much time and effort to design the projects themselves and summer break is the time for the students to rest, spend time with their own family members and friends, and use their effort on extracurricular activities. However, they can arrange their schedule to make time for the projects and they can decide whether to make the project big or small. Other may argue that students might have hard time doing the project since it is not instructed. However, it is true that people improve and grow when they challenge themselves. It is better to have challenge for the students, which is the self-designed project. Also, since the students can design the project, they can design it to their own aility.

Since it helps the students to improve their creativity and helps them to remember the lessons better, the summer projects should be student-designed. Challenging themselves is the only way for them to improve and have more experience. It is the better way of learning.                   ",5,Summer projects,Independent
22FD17FB1BEB,"How would you like to do a boring project on your summer break? Doesn't sound fun, does it? Schools believe that during the summer students need to actively learn. They ensure students continue learning by giving them summer projects. The matter at hand is; whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. It is the students project, so why shouldn't it be designed by them? In most cases, teacher-designed projects are very detailed and include many parts, the teachers expect too much from the students. A student-designed project can ensure interest in the project, teacher-designed projects become boring and there's a lack of interest. During summer break many students will go on vacations or visit family, having the students design the projects assigned can allow them to take into account the time they have available.

Teacher-designed projects are very intricate and the teachers expect too much from the students. Teachers have high standards. High standards can be good during the school year but for a summer project this can become very stressful. There are a plethora of components to a teacher-designed project, research, citations, outlines, rough drafts, and countless more. These projects force students to push themselves. Many might argue that its good for students to push themselves, but it is summer break after all and students have been pushing themselves for about ten months. These students are tired and adding stress to their vacation is cruel.

Doing a project you're uninterested in can be very bland and boring. Teachers don't think about how uninteresting a topic or project can be to a student. Not having interest in a topic can be very detrimental to a students grade and the effort they put into the project. The same reaction can come from a boring class, students will start to loose focus, dread doing the work, or not put in any effort. I've personally experienced doing a project I had no interest in. I subconsciously procrastinated which lead to turning it in very late. I could not focus on the task and was drowning in work by the time it was due. If a student were to designed the project they could choose a topic they were genuinely interested in. This would set them up for success and they could have fun learning something new.

Summer break is commonly associated with spending time with family and going on vacations. This is the case for most students. Giving students a long, details, mandated project is time consuming and takes away from their vacation. As a child of a divorced couple, my summers are filling with traveling to see my dad and spending time with him. I've personally experience having a summer project that I had to take time out of seeing my Father to do, which was upsetting because I only see him once a year. It's students like me who would love the chance to design their summer projects. Given the chance to design their summer project students can ensure for themselves that it will not take away from their own plans and it will encourage them to finish it in a more timely manner.

Some schools assign students summer projects to assure they continue to learn during their vacation. These projects should be designed by the students. The projects should be student-designed because teachers have high standards. Due to these high standards their projects require students to push themselves when all year that what they've been doing. Lack of interest plays a huge role in many teacher's projects. Teachers aren't doing their best to assure that their projects spark some aspect of interest in their students. Having no interest in a project can cause the student to procrastinate and not do their best. Lastly, students have complicated schedules in the summer, many go away on vacation or spend time with family. Having a teacher designed-project that's time consuming can take away from their valuable time. Letting students design the project can ensure they will have enough time to work on it and will encourage them to finish it earlier. Student-designed projects can benefit the student immensely in multiple ways, where as a teacher-designed project will let them down and cause unnecessary stress.",5,Summer projects,Independent
473019D8E912,"Firstly a teacher or a student to design a summer project. Most students would say to let them design it. But with this generation the smartest choice would be to let the teacher do it. Because they're the ones with the experience with making these projects. If they told me to sit down and make a project I wouldn't even know where to begin. Like kids these days barely know how to tie their own shoe. One expects them to do a whole project for them to do in the summer.

Teachers literally learned how to teach, how to make test/projects, how to make it make sense and not be all over the place, also how to make it fun for the student. Teachers study for how many years four or five for what to let a student do their job and make their own project. The student isn't learning anything from making his own project. The only real thing they would learn is how to put a project together. But if I had to do it I wouldn't even learn that I would try to make the project simple for me so I wouldn't have to do a lot of work.

Also kids these days have gotten really lazy, for example, my little sister in the summer she doesn't do anything but be on her phone and in bed all day. I couldn't imagine her doing a project in the summer nor less make one. A student wouldn't make the project difficult they would make it as easy as possible. They would probably make themselves just draw a picture of what they did in the summer. Students don't want to learn in the summer that's their time off when they get a break. No student that I know wants to do any work in the summer and most kids I know wouldn't even do it.

I remember getting a project in the summer when I was in the sixth grade. The teacher also made it and to be honest it was a large project but it help. The next year when we reviewed when we came back from summer I wasn't lost I still remembered a lot of information because of that project. But if a student had made it he wouldn't even know what to put on it. I would've been screwed because I would've done a project a kid made that didn't even know what we learned about that year. Teachers just knows what to put it together and how to organize it and that helps a lot.

If they just let teachers do it and make the projects students would learn more then if a student made it. We also always get those kids that don't do it either way. Just let the teachers do their job and make it they have more experience then a kid that is just always on their phone. The student also has a better chance of actually learning if the teacher makes it, then if the student made it themselves. In the end of the day the program just wants to make kids learn and get the information they need. So just the the professionals do it. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
759AFC5BD52A,"The youth are the leaders of tomorrow. This is often said by older individuals regarding the upcoming generation. As a leader, one often has to make many decisions and develop designs for numerous events and plans. In order to prepare the youth for this role, they should be given assignments that allow them to design and solve situations. School is one of the various places where the youth can practice this skill. Summer projects assigned to student should be student-designed because project would be of high quality, students will better retain the information that they learn and the students are motivated to complete the project.

The first reason why summer projects should be student-designed is due to the fact that the completed projects would be of high quality. Students will invest copious amounts of time and effort in order to complete the project that they have designed. This was seen with chemistry students, at Generic_School, who designed their own lab involving a unit taught in class. Those students spent an extended amount of time investing and researching information that they needed to conduct the lab that they designed. The students also spent hours in lab, running through numerous trials and collecting data. The dedication that theses students posses displays the lengths the students may go to, so they can complete their self designed project. The large amount of effort and time that students put into their project results in high quality work because students have a deep understanding of the topic and strong application which is illustrated in their project. Schools should assign student-designed summer projects as the completed project would be of high quality.

The second reason that schools should allow summer projects to be student-designed is because students will better retain the information that they learn. When students are given the power to design their own project, they are more attentive to the information that they are gathering. This was seen with history students, at Generic_School, who conducted research and wrote a paper on a social group during World War II. When going through sources and evaluating them, students paid close attention to the dates and origin of the sources. This was helpful for students as it prevented them from wasting time on sources that were not beneficial for their paper. Students were also able to have deep conversations with each other about the various socials groups using the information that they had learned online. Assigning student-designed projects for the summer should be done because students will better retain the information that they learn.

The final reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students would be more motivated to complete the project. When giving students the freedom to design a project that they will be working on for almost three months, empowerment is often felt by students as they believe that they are respected and trusted enough to develop a project based off of their own design. This empowerment causes students to have more desire to complete the project, and the projects will be completed to high level of satisfaction. This can also be seen when a parent tells their child to make a meal for dinner. The child feels empowered since they have the freedom to create whatever dish they like; the empowerment that the child feels motivates the child to complete the task to a high satisfaction level. Student-designed the summer projects would also result in eagerness from the students. Since students have the ability to design their project, they would be more inclined to create a design that is interesting to them. This interest would make students eager as they will want to see the results of their plans.

Student-designed summer projects should be assigned by schools because students' motivation to complete the project would increase.

Teacher-designed summer projects would be less time consuming for students;however, teacher-designed projects would not prepare students for the upcoming school. During the school year, students are often required to create their own essay, lab design and presentation by teachers for a grade. Students completing a design that they have created will allow them to practice skills that teachers will require during the school year.

Overall, summer projects assigned by schools should be student-designed because the completed projects would be of high quality, students will better retain the information that they learn and students would be more motivated to complete the project. These reasons should encourage schools that assign summer project to allow the projects to be student-designed.",5,Summer projects,Independent
237FA40D5CFD,"Schools across the country have been implementing a method that ensures that students continue learning during their break, this method is: Summer projects. Summer projects are usually teacher-designed and inconvenient for a majority of students over the summer. There has been a great debate whether or not summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed, I personally think they should be designed by students.

Often times when students are assigned summer projects they are incapable of completing them due to vacations or other activities. Students should design summer projects because they know what they are capable of completing. Some students have jobs, sports, or volunteering, which do not give them ample time to compete their summer projects. In eighth grade, I was tasked with a summer assignment, but I couldn't complete it because half of the time I either did not have internet connection or I was too busy exploring new places. If I had designed my own summer project that year, I would have been able to complete it due to the fact that I know my own schedule and capabilities

If summer projects are student-designed it would be more enjoyable for students. Students know what methods bore them and what methods do not; students can omit the methods that bore them and replace them with a more interactive methods. On the contrary, teachers are more experienced with creating projects, can ensure students are learning what is required, and know exactly what curriculum should be in summer projects.

Student-designed summer projects give students more incentive to complete them; they are more interactive and cater to students. Student-designed summer projects would be flexible and easier to comprehend for students. Ask yourself, would you want to plan your summer or let a project plan it for you?",4,Summer projects,Independent
3FB35A81AA24,"Students after a long and rested summer break usually come back to school in August forgetting what they learned the previous year. To assure that students continue to learn over their break they should be able to make their own project instead of having a teacher designed project.

Summer projects should be student designed as it provides more creativity and freedom in their work, as well as it shows that they understand the given content by the teacher, but the project may not be easy to understand and complete compared to a teacher designed project.

A student designed project over Summer break creates creativity in the students because they would have to break their boundaries in order to discover what they need to create in their project. Students will also have more freedom because they will be able to chose their topics based on their own interest. This allows students to be excited to learn during their summer break; for example, if they are allow to choose what their project will be based about they will be more productive and continue to learn more as they will have an interest in their work unlike a teacher designed project that students might disagree on and become less productive to a topic that creates no satisfaction towards the students. That is terrible for the schools when students arrive back to school over break as they would not have learn as much because their topic was not interesting and maybe some would choose not to complete the teacher designed project because of the topic.

Allowing students to create their own project also visualizes that they understood their teacher content, by taking their teacher content and combining it to their own ideas into a project that shows the teacher that the students still remembers what they learn over summer break. While a teacher design project does not show if a student fully understand the content because every student will all have the same ideas and will be unable to show what new content they learned over the summer.

Because student gets to work on their interests which may be different then what they learn in their school year, they would have to do research to learn new topics that they never could have done with a teacher design project. A teacher project would not need to research new topics as they would just need to revise on what they learned over the school year. Thats why a student design project is better for learning for when they return back to school they would've had learned new content.

A teacher designed project is the least choice for a summer project. Although, it does have its own benefits such as being less stressful on students to work on this project because they will already know the basics and what to do for the project. They would be able to work together helping student understand the content more; for example, they would look over each other work making sure that they understand that they are doing the project correctly. Teacher designed project allows student to refresh and review what they learned during the school year over Summer break, that a student design project will be unable to accomplish due to the fact that teacher designed project is mainly about what they already learn instead of expanding into new topics.

In order to allow students to learn over their Summer break they would need student designed project to allow them to learn new things while also giving them more creativity that will help them out when they return to school. The student design allows for opportunity for the students to choose what they might want to do in the future and interest while a teacher design is not fully capable of doing the same. Allowing student designed project will help schools and student grow and learn while they are on break so that they don't come back to school forgetting main topics and having to waste time relearning such topics.",5,Summer projects,Independent
D5FDDB4DFA82,"For most students, summer means the beginning of a much needed months-long break from school. For some, however, the stress of school never fades away. Some schools require that students complete assigned summer projects in order to continue learning, even when not in school. The importance of continued education is rarely argued, but the way some projects are planned out might not always result in engagement and time investment from the student. To combat this, schools should allow students to design their own projects. This would assist in motivating them to put their best work in, less stress upon the student, and helping them feel a sense of pride and accomplishment in their finished product.

As a student who has had to deal with a multitude of summer projects, I can say without a doubt that I have never looked forward to spending time out of my day to work on them. The most typical summer project given to me and most students has been summer reading. The books are almost always teacher assigned, subsequently tying them into their curriculum for the upcoming year. Before my junior year began, I was tasked with reading

In Cold Blood by Truman Capote for my English class. Personally, I enjoyed the book, but the project that went along with it was less than interesting. In turn, this led to me putting off my project until the last few days of my summer break, bringing along the stress of having to cram it in before the school year started. Since this project was teacher-designed, I also had to make sure to follow the strict guidelines in order to ensure a high grade when I turned it in to the teacher. If I was able to create my own project relating to the book rather than a teacher-designed project, I truly believe I would have enjoyed my finished product more than I did, along with eliminating the stress put upon me by the project's strict guidelines.

When a student is assigned a summer project, their immediate thoughts are almost always negative. This comes with the fact that they do not want to do work over their break, as this is one of the few times out of the year that they're allowed to forget about school for just one moment. Adding to this, if the student is given a teacher-designed project, this puts the motivation to do said project even lower than before. They know that they have no control over how their project turns out, as they often revolve around a fairly black-and-white rubric, resulting in a lack of diversity and creativity between each individual's project. If a student is tasked with the creation of their own project, however, this leads to a wide variety of exciting and new projects that vary from student to student, also placing motivation in their hearts to make the best project they possibly can.

Often after a teacher-designed project is finished, the only reaction of the student is relief that it's finally over. With teacher-designed projects, students often only work to completion, not to make a project they enjoy. However, if students are able to design their own projects, the reactions to their finished product would give them self-pride that they created what they believe to be their best work. For example, when I created a project after reading

The Road by Cormac McCarthy, I was able to look at my completed project with the feeling of pride and joy that I had truly created the best project I possibly could. The increase in moral for these students would give them a more enjoyable learning environment and the excitement of a new school year starting so that they're able to share their work with someone else who will appreciate it.

Many teachers would argue that the creation of student-designed projects would be unimportant to the curriculum, as they don't truly focus on something that needs to be taught. However, the importance of student-designed projects is to encourage them to be creative and to not be stuck in the mindset of just passing the class, instead opening their eyes to new ideas and allowing them to think outside the box.",5,Summer projects,Independent
48B386AA9B32,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. The type of these summer projects vary from school to school. There is no definitive school project. But, there is a argument over whether summer projects should be student-designed, or teacher-designed. These summer projects should be student-designed as it allows students to express their creativity, and allows students to be able to balance their social lives and the summer project.

Summer is meant to be a break, to allow students to rest and get ready for the new school year. This means they could be able to design their project non-traditionally, because chances are, they're a little exhausted from the traditional tests, projects, and quizzes. Students could even enjoy their selves while doing the project. For example, a student may want to do a project on the wildlife of the Chesapeake Bay. So instead of researching this from home, they could go to a conservation area to interact with the wildlife and talk to the rangers there. This helps make the researching process more simple to process. This also allows the student to present their subject about they're passionate about, comparing that a assigned topic from a teacher that doesn't interest them as much. For example, a student may choose to do a project on the guitar, something they're passionate about. Students would be more engaged, focused, willing to learn, and enjoying the whole project. If teachers assigned them a topic, there would be a good chance none of these emotions would be generated.

While Summer can be a relaxing and exciting time of the year, it can also be one of those most busy and turbulent times of the year. Many people love to travel, do new things, and get jobs, especially students. Because of this, a traditional teacher-assigned project would require a lot of time that students just may not have. For example, since it would be a ideal time for students to get a job, they wouldn't be able to devote a lot of time to the teacher- assigned project. Although if the project was student-designed, students could be more flexible. For example, if they choose to do a project on local businesses, they could get a job at a local business. They would get paid, gain experience, and help with the project all at the same time. This way, students can choose their topic that fits right into their summer plans.

Summer is a valuable and exciting time of the year, where school is one of the last things on a student's mind during Summer. If they are assigned a project though, it should be student-designed, as it lets students be as creative as they want with the project, and allows student to manage the time used on the project, and the time used on their social lives. If students are forced to do a project over the summer, at least let them enjoy their selves a bit with it.",4,Summer projects,Independent
41E45EFE43AA,"Summer projects are some of the most dreaded assignments to give to a student. However, they are very necessary in order for students to retain information needed for the following school year. Summer projects, involving schools, should be teacher-designed in order to optimize students's learning.

Firstly, a teacher knows what to assign best based on the class curriculum. If students were to all decide what the project was and how it should be done, then there would be a multitude of topics and confusion amongst the class. In seventh grade we were given a choice assignment to do. Although it was a fun project and allowed us to use creativity, it didn't lead us to the same information. In a summer project, the main purpose being to continue learning, a student-designed project may not be the best way to learn about a common topic.

Secondly, the school year would flow much smoother with a teacher-designed project. In my sophomore year I was assigned a summer assignment for world history. It was the same assignment given to the whole class, and was meant to be completed the same way as well. Completing it made it easier for my teacher and classmates to refer to as the year went on. Similar to a textbook, we all were able to use the same resource to make learning easier and allow the class to flow smoother.

On the contrary however, students may not have the time to complete a summer project in a specified way. During summer break it is very common for people to travel or have family in town. For example, every year I go out of town on road trips to visit family. This year my mom told me that we would be visiting family in Africa. Places like Africa may not have all the necessary resources to complete an assignment the exact way a teacher asks. Even if a student were to have resources available, constant travel may limit a student's time and ability to focus. Students may have to get creative and modify or design their project in a way that would allow them to complete it before the beginning of the school year.

Lastly, If a student were to design his or her project, they would likely take the easy route in order to enjoy the rest of their summer. Although I have many positive qualities, I am known to take the easy route when it comes to a lot of things. In my fifth grade science fair we were allowed to decide our own experiments to do. Instead of trying to think of a topic that may attract viewers at my booth, or something that interested me, I chose the most basic experiment I could think of, ""which paper airplane would fly the farthest."" When it comes to school students are prone to rush through any work given. Like myself, they'd take the easy route and limit their own capabilities.

Summer projects are important for schools and teachers to implement whether it be student-designed or teacher-designed. However in the case of productivity, teacher-designed projects bear more benefits. School year flow, class content, and a student's work habits all play roles in why teacher-designed projects should be the main source of assignments given over the summer.",5,Summer projects,Independent
A13182AA4AD8,"Summer project to assure students continue to learn is a great idea, the projects however, should be teacher-designed. A teachers job is to assure that the students are learning. The teachers meet all the criteria to design the project to be specific to what they are learning or will learn, educational, and a valuable learning experience. Students loose a lot of what the have learned during the school year, this makes summer projects important. When keeping up with skills acquired over the school year, teachers are more likely to design the summer project to be effective in keeping up with academic skills than students.

Teachers care about their students education and helping them succeed in the future is the goal .

Teachers set the requirements for their class. Therefore, they can make the project specific to what they are learning next year. For example, when enrolling in AP Lang you are required to read a certain book and write a report over the summer. When school starts you focus on the topic of the book for that unit. This teacher based project was specific to what the students learned, educational, and a valuable learning experience for that subject at hand. This project assured that students continued to learn over the summer and was big help when they started school up again.

Teachers put more effort into designing projects, making sure they meet requirements,are up to date on the subject, and will challenge a student.

They will not make the project easy like something students can finish in a week or something they can look up online. The purpose of the project is that the students continue learning. For example, in the book

The Great Gatsby , Gatsby lies all the time like where he is from, all the great adventures he has been on etc. Gatsby says "" I lived in the middle west for a great time"" and Nick ask where, he the states ""Generic_City"". This shows that lying will not get you far but doing the work and telling the truth will.

Students are lazy and since it is there summer time they will not spend too much time on a project they design themselves. They will try to lie their way out of it like Gatsby. When keeping up with skills acquired over the school year, teachers are more likely to design the summer project to be effective in keeping up with academic skills than students. Summer projects projects are important and should not be taken lightly, to succeed and go on to higher education, a teacher is the best person to trust when creating a project.         ",4,Summer projects,Independent
CFBCF638F69D,"Summer is the time of the year most people enjoy. Students usually enjoy this time the most. However, there is one thing that can completely ruin it. Summer projects, something most kids would cry if they heard they had to do them. Most students show hatred towards them because it takes away from their favorite time of the year, summer! Most students forget or just chose not to complete them. Summer projects were created to keep students learning during long breaks. Teacher's usually assign these students topics. However, I believe if you give students the responsibility of choosing their own projects they would strive to complete them and mature mentally as young adults should. Student-designed projects see more completion, interest, and improvement than the average assignment. I, as a student, would want control over my project. I typically do not do as well with teacher topics as well as some of my other fellow students.

When teachers design their summer projects they use topics that fit into the lesson plan or that interest them personally. This is not fair to the student. If a student received a topic that they hated they would, more than likely, fail that project. There are a lot students who would toughen up and do the project, but most students are not like that. They will put in minimal effort towards the project just enough to pass if that. This effects grades and does not show a students true ability to perform outside the learning environment.

Humans grow in controlled situations. We as the students should be given that opportunity to grow by controlling our project. If students chose their own topics there would show a lot more effort in completion of the project. This improves the want to learn, has a better effect on grades, and learning mentality improves tremendously. Students would take more time for better results and show select skills taught by teachers, which is what teachers want to see.

I believe student-designed is the way to go. Giving us the power also gives us motivation to do it. I strive when I can do research on things I like or have a slight interest in. It is a completely different experience when you can learn about what you want to versus being in a classroom forced to learn about boring topics. For example, the American Revolution or chemical equations. By giving us topics were at an automatic disadvantage with a 32% higher chance of failure.

In other words, students have better performance with self-liked topics. Teacher-designs typically get less attention and a lot more failures from students. Finally, if you want better results from your students give them a little power every now and then. We strive in those situations made by ourselves contrasted to the ones picked out for us.",4,Summer projects,Independent
7E8ED7CA1E70,"Some schools require students to complete summer teacher-designed projects. Knowledge can't be taken away from one once being aquired. We can say that learning is something we do in our every day lives. Even during a small break like Spring Break, students tent to forget the material they priorly learned. Summer is no different, if not worse. School should provide students with student-designed summer projects because, it gives them motivation to learn, teaches them about responsibilities, learn about time management.

Student-designed projects can give students motivation to learn more during their vacation. The goal of having schools require students to complete a summer project is to assure they stay learning. What a better way to do this than with something personalize to each student. They can do something they find interesting and unique. This produces drive in them. Students get to learn and do something they find passion in, at the same time motivating them to go the extra mile to learn.

Summer projects can also teach them about responsibilities. School already teaches students to be responsible and to identify what are their priorities at the moment. Once summer comes in and students face themselves with so much free time in their hands; Learning is no longer a priority. Some tent to lack motivation and that results in laziness. Putting their responsibilities aside and not their main priority. Being responsible is a trait you'll find yourself using often in your day to day life. With a summer project schools are making sure students have something that will be of their interest, providing them the oportunity to obtain knowledge at the same time.

Students will have to learn about time management. In order for students to be able to have free time during their break they'll have to learn how to manage their time. This is another form of identifying your priorities. Time management is something that we all use to be more successful in life. It's something students will use for their jobs, at home, school, and even in their hobbies. It's a trait that will make students life less stressful and they'll be more likely to get more work done effortlessly.

Some would say that summer is meant for students to have a break from school and that theirs no point in summer break if they still have to do school projects. This is why student-designed projects are something school should provide students with. It gives them something productive to do while learning traits they'll use all life long not only at school. Teaching them dicipliny and dedication. In conclusion schools should provide students with student-designed summer projects to assure that they'll be learning,not only about school but personal traits that will help them in the long run while doing something of their interest that won't feel forced. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
19692639977E,"The school should require a summer projects and they coud be students-designed because, summer is the opportunity for the students relax, It's going to be more interesting if they can choose what to do, and can be a project that they will enjoy learn about because they doing something that they are interesting, and the projec shold be extra graded.

Summer vacations are the most expected break for students because they have almost three months for relax and enjoy the hot summer,a lof of them travel to beach or summers houses and they don't expect to have school assignments, having the right to choose what to do is better for them to understand how important is for them to learn things outside school.

Students having the choice of your own project is going to make the work more interesting and they will enjoy doing and they will not struggling to turn in. they can design a project about how is the experience of summer, what he did, if he meet new people, which places he visited and what is the meaning of the word 'summer' for him. doing this, the projec is going to turn like a diary, will be part of his rotine and it's going to meka easy and nice.

Extra grade sounds like a good ideia because the students will start a new year on school and most of them will like to start the year already with a extra grade.

Projects are someting that we should be familiar with because if we are planning go to college, there they do so may projects and extra works. Having a summer project make the students keep the focus on school and even though being extra is something that you will not regret doing, will just help you get ready for your fucture without struggling.",3,Summer projects,Independent
65AACA4E3F2E,"Teacher designed assignments would be the best way to help kids keep learning over the summer. The kids would not know the stuff for next year if they created the assignment. Teachers know the subject, they can also design it around the students learning needs.

Teachers know the subject because they went to college to teach that subject and know it well. The students would probably make the assignment so short and useless so they can mess around all summer. It is best that the teachers design it because they might need the students to learn material that they do not have time in the school year to teach. They can also use this assignment to get less important information out of the way so they can spend time on more important information. Or spend time on a hard unit that the students have not grasped yet.

The students should be able to design the assignment so they can have time over the break for them selves. They could have multiple assignments from other teachers. It would a lot of work for them because the usually have to take 6-7 classes. If they designed the assignment they could make short with all the stuff they need and the could still have to enjoy summer. Some students could have a job over the summer or have a sport they play and the assignment would take up any of there extra free time.

The teachers would be able to design the assignment around the students way learn. this would help them a lot easier so they can get the information better. The students would be greatly beneficial if the teacher adapted to their learning style. All students learn differently so this assignment could also give the teacher a heads up on how to teacher all of their students. If the teacher did not give out and assignment they might not have a easy time trying to teach those kids because they do not know what they know and how to teach it right.

Teachers know the course, and they can design the material around the students learning ability. All of this said a teacher designed assignment is the way to go if it is assigned. Both the teacher and students would be greatly rewarded if the teacher designs the project.",4,Summer projects,Independent
71041E811684,"I always said to myself ""if I had the chance to student-design a project for school it was going to be unique"". I know that may sound weird but it's true i'm kinda a nerd when it comes to those type of things. Sophomore year was that year for me! When my flex teacher Generic_Name told the class about the student-design project and that the project had to involve something that you liked to do. I was so excited, my head could have explode like a airhead. My project was going to be that I made myself a homemade Manikin head and to style the hair. I loved doing hair that is what made this whole project unique. I wonder what other students would choose to do if their school required them to do a student-design project. The statement that some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break is true;these projects should be student-designed because students will show how creative they can be in a learning aspect and more students may actually participate in the summer project assignment.

When students think project they tend to think that it is going to be something fun and interesting they are going to have to do. Having a student-designed summer project allows for students to use their creativity in a learning aspect. For example, I used my creativity in a learning matter when I got to do my self-designed project assignment. It was a interesting time completing because I had to use my creativity by showing something I liked to do in a learning aspect. That allowed me to bring in math and science to complete the whole project, Therefore, giving a student a student-designed summer project would allow for students to use their creativity in a learning aspect.

When students are given summer projects to have completed by the beginning of the following school year the assignment may just be forgotten about or many students will not even try to complete the assignment. Imagine giving students a self-designed summer project, this will allow for more students to actually participate in the summer assignment. In the summer students do not think about school almost at all. So, if students are given a student-designed summer project there will be more students completing the assignment. They get to follow their own rules. For example, when students are told how to do something they have a hard time doing it. when they are told to do something and make it their own they are more excited to finish the assignment and get it turned in.

Furthermore, giving a student a student-designed summer project would allow for more students to actually participate and complete the assignment.

In conclusion, When schools give out required summer projects they should be student-designed because students will show how creative they can be in a learning aspect and more students may actually participate in the summer assignment. Other students may think that teacher-designed projects are a better way of assigning summer project for the fact it may be more organized. This would allow for teachers to know what to expect when it is time for the students to turn in the project. Do not get me wrong I still feel that students should be allowed to self-design there own project in the summer. Am I saying that because i'm a student? Yes I am because I know if all the projects I got assigned were student-designed I would be the first to turn them in!            ",5,Summer projects,Independent
74DAEA65F420,"Keeping your mind working during the summer will help you get into the new school year better. This is why most schools require you to complete a summer reading list. Having schools give us projects during the summer will be fun. I believe schools should have these projects be student-designed because students would be more inclined to do them and it would be enjoyable.

If these projects were student-designed the students would be more willing to do them since they would be choosing the topic to work on. In my experiences, if my mom told me to do something I didn't want to do I would not do it to the best of my abilities. However, if I choose what to do it wouldn't feel as a 'must' but rather a 'want,' so I would take my time doing it. Students would have a good time doing a project they are interested in; they would be excited when working on it. Having excitement while doing projects helps you do better on them.

Having these project be student-designed would make the students feel as if it wasn't a school assignment that they had to do on their summer break. I typically don't want to do school work during my breaks; so, if I had to choose what topic I would be working on, it would be more enjoyable for me. I will still be learning of course but I would be working on something I am interested in. Most projects that are teacher-designed that I get assigned to don't interest me, I dread doing them. If these projects were student-designed it would insure student learning, while also having fun during summer.

Some people however, may believe the students would not complete the projects if it was student-designed. If the students did not know what to choose for their projects they may not even bother to do it. Having to pick something for myself and not knowing what to do typically frustrates me and make me feel as if I don't want to do it. Having that much freedom may be too much for the students that often don't do their work. Restricting the projects to be teacher-designed will ensure the students to complete the projects and continue learning during their summer breaks.

Making these projects student-designed will make the students feel inclined to complete them and it will be fun for them. Having to choose their own topics will encourage them to complete the project. Students should be having fun during the summer, it is their break for completing the school year. Forcing them to work on a topic they no not enjoy will not let them have fun. If students were required to do work during the summer, they should be doing something they choose to do.      ",5,Summer projects,Independent
86E5ADAE8206,"As a student, one of the worst situations is one where an assignment is given that is unclear, vague, or otherwise difficult to understand. Completing projects is usually a laborsome enough activity on its own, but when the question or prompt is incomprehensible, it turns a small hill of a task into a mountain of one. Too many students have been in this situation and know what it is like to be immeasurably confused and frustrated because the assignment is too difficult to interpret. To make matters worse, students quite often do not know how to contact their teachers during the summer, so they are given no help or clarity as to what they are supposed to do. To avoid this, as well as a multitude of other issues, summer projects should be designed by the students, because they understand how to design the project to make it more ideal, it will allow the students to have more control over which direction the project is taken, and it would also benefit the teachers by stopping them from having to do even more work.

Different people can take different pieces of information away from the same things. Sometimes people will pick up on completely different parts of text than others would. This should not be an issue, but when a teacher is pushing for students to make a project from one angle or perspective, it could prove very restricting since they did not form the same viewpoint on the information. By designing their own projects, students could eliminate this obstacle and just create something based on what they took away from their learning. This would help students to be much more creative and would allow them to properly highlight what they learned. One could argue that this is counter intuitive since students would not all have the takeaway the teacher wants them to gain, but summer projects are once again just about assuring that students are learning and usually not followed up on as true assignments. The question of if a student learned the same thing as everyone else should not be as important as them just learning something relevant in general.

Giving students control over what they do for a summer project could greatly benefit their learning. By requiring them to design the project themselves, students are then also required to step up to the plate and be more responsible and creative. Learning to develop these characteristics is far more important than any history or science lesson their project may be on. As stated earlier, summer projects are usually not followed up on, making students even more likely to forget what they learned about from them. And at the very least, making the projects student-designed would save teachers from having to do it themselves, which they would most likely appreciate since they are already given enough work as is. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
50062F957F2C,"Have you ever gotten stuck just staring at your project your teacher has designed because you don't know what to put? I agree that projects which are assigned over the summer should be designed by students. The two main reasons they should be student designed is because students have more control and also creativity.

Students are less stressed when they have full control over their project. Over the summer when I had a summer project that I had to design; I had less tension knowing that I didn't have to follow a certain guideline for my project. Another time when I had full control over my project was when I was assigned to a science project. The teacher did not specify any guidelines or resources, so this allowed me to research various documents and data using websites and databases. This improved the amount of information that I included in my projects, because researching from various sources helped me include more detailed information.

Students also have more creativity when allowed to design their projects. When teachers allow students to design their projects, this removes the boundary of a students creativity. When I was assigned a reading project that I was allowed to design, I chose to design a video; allowing me to choose how to design it helped me in the long run, because it allowed me to use a format that I knew how to use. Also, when students chose their projects, they want to put their best effort into it. For example, when I designed my career related project, I already knew some information about my career, so I had more time to put in creative details into my project. This made my project look its best

Although teachers may think students may not learn effectively when they design their projects. That is not completely true. Since students are designing the project. They have to research different sources, which will teach them new things along the way. Personally, when teachers designed the project and resources to use I did not learn a lot of information, because there wasn't many resources to use. This limits the amount of information a student knows. Unlike teacher-designed projects, students can learn information that can show up in the future in their curriculum, which would help the student.

I agree that projects which are assigned over the summer should be designed by students. Student-designed projects show much more promise, because of how much more control and creativity a student has designing the project. This enables a student to use many more resources and effort into a project that they have thought of on their own. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
21B1546505A8,"Summer projects are common all over the world. They are used to make sure that students are maintaining their knowledge, and even getting some background information for the next year. These assignments can be designed and formed by teachers, or even students. Student designed summer projects are much more beneficial for the kids, making them more interesting, taking less time from their breaks, and even giving students more room to work freely. Students shouldn't decide on all of their project terms; rather, they should write themselves a prompt or question to work around, and have it approved by the teacher.

Primarily, student-made projects are much more interesting to the students working on them. If the students themselves are selecting their topic, or project type, it will result in a more enjoyable experience for the kids. In turn, raising the number of students who actually do their projects, and make sure that they are getting the experience they need. Sure, teacher designed assignments are good for making sure that the student is working on something that will relate to their next year of schooling, but if teachers take full control it will leave students stuck with a tough topic that they cannot write passionately about.

When teachers let students design their projects, they are giving the students much more room to work freely. Students will have a topic that they will actually care about, a topic that will fuel the students brain to create what they want to create. When students are allowed to stick to something that they are passionate about, they will work as hard as possible to convey their points effectively. If teachers would just give their students the freedom that they need, they wouldn't be stuck writing around some arbitrary prompts, instead giving the students the ability to write about what they truly care for. Students won't have anything to restrain them from writing as best they can.

Student assigned projects will even take away less time from the summer for their work. If students enjoy their topic and are passionate about it, they will take less time to finish it. This is very much a good thing because it will give the students the break they deserve, while still giving them enough to do so that they won't empty their brains during summer. If the students don't get the summer they worked so hard during the school year for, they will burnout, mental health among teens will lessen, and they will be stressed out of their minds.

In conclusion, students should design their summer assignments. Student designed projects will benefit the kids in many ways, including making the work more interesting to the student, giving them more freedom within their work, and even cutting down on summer time stolen by their school work. When students are allowed to pick their topics and prompts for their summer assignments, the schools will see nothing but improvement, in grades, work turned in, and most importantly, mental health.",4,Summer projects,Independent
BEE6B76959CE,"Summer break is every students dream; three whole months away from school. While students see this time period as a blessing teachers do not agree so much. Three months away from school equates to three whole months of time spent not learning about the core subjects. To combat this loss of learning, teachers provide students with summer projects to take home on work on while they are on their break. These are usually in the form of summer reading projects, but they can also be take home tests designed to keep students thinking about what they have learned in school. Summer projects always seem to have a flawed system of being very rigorous and demanding of students, despite them being on break from school. On top of this, summer projects lack in student cultural connection as teachers are not as kept up in student and teenage culture as they could be. Summer projects are always made by the teachers, however what if they were student-designed? Should these projects be designed by the student body or be given to the hands of the teachers? Summer projects should be designed by students because they will be more related to current student cultures, easier for students to comprehend, and require students to do less rigorous work.

To start off, summer projects should be designed by the students because they will relate more to current student culture. student culture changes rapidly, and what is relevant one day can be seen as old news the next day. For as invested as teachers can get in student culture, they most likely won't be able to keep up especially with the increase of technology which provides social media outlets to students. Because teachers can't keep up to well with student culture, they won't be able to provide creative assignments that include student culture which is also the fate of summer projects which are usually mundane and one-dimensional for students. A great example of a mundane summer project is the summer reading project. Students are told to choose one book, read the book, and answer they questions it asks. The books are almost always and old time classic and never relate to students as they have plots that go over the students heads. Having a student-designed summer project will help combat this problem of student culture as they know what books usually contain good content for students to enjoy. After all, they are also students. Keeping students connected with school and learning is an important part of a teachers job, and giving them bland summer reading projects is not a great way of doing so. Having students design a summer project for themselves will easily keep them connected with school.

Secondly, summer projects should be designed by students because they will be easier to comprehend. One problem with summer projects is that they can be confusing. They usually contain multiple steps with can contain multiple parts. It's easy to see why teachers do this which is to make sure students are being thorough with their work however it really is not necessary for students. Teachers have the curse of deep knowledge of a subject. Because of this, they often require every piece of information to fully understand a topic. Students don't have that much knowledge of a certain subject and instead understand from just a small frame work. For example, when adults spend money the question every small finance, from tax to coupons. Students, which are children, often go out and spend their money no questions asked. Yes, being aware of where the money goes is important, but that is important to adults who have much more responsibility then kids. The idea here is that having a simple summer project that is easy to understand is more beneficial to students, as they can understand with small frame work. Making confusing summer projects turns into tedious work, which is also another issue with summer projects.

Lastly, summer projects should be designed by students because they will be less rigorous work. Having a long summer project is not always beneficial to students as teachers may think. For example, while on summer break I got a summer reading project that asked for 20 quotes from the book that were interesting. When school came back around none of those 20 quotes were ever used in any lesson plan for the day. the quotes were just rigor work designed to keep students busy during the summer. Having a student-designed project will have students doing less work, while still keeping them interested in the project. Students can easily identify what is filler work and instead make work that will be used in some way by the teacher. Using the work that the students do over break and incorporating it into a lesson plan is a great way of teaching the students important concepts that they should always have memorized.

To sum up, having students design summer projects is a great idea because they'll be more related to student culture, be easier to understand by the students themselves, and require students to do less filler work. Of course, teachers and parents would say that having students design the project themelves is a bad idea as students will just make the project too easy, however the whole project development will be overseen by teachers and adults to make sure the projects are fair. That being said, schools should really give a chance to let students design their own summer projects. Teachers in general are not as connected to student body as the students themselves are. Giving students this chance to develop their own summer projects is a stellar idea and could put forth a lot of great projects with very creative outcomes. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
1BC6B0614AD2,"Summer break is really the students' time. They get to unwind, relax, and be youthful and chaotic. That being said, they should get to design their own summer project. They can shift it to an area of strong personal interest and present their results in a way that they prefer. It would also give teachers a break from lesson planning and let them relax a bit more over the summer. It would even help the students actually learn better since it's self-paced over three months of time. Let the students design their summer project.

Students should be able to focus on a topic that interests them. They spend 180 seven-hour days in school, over half of which are spent on things that the student will never use nor care about in their life. In fact, I would say that, based on my experience in an average year of high school, that only about thirty-one out of the 180 days are actually interesting due to content of learning. If the student cares about the work they are doing, then they will do a better job and have a higher quality finished product. Plus, they will not end up turning in thirty-five of the exact same project.

If students get to design their summer project, it would take some of the stress away from the teachers. Based on the amount of homework I have received from some of my classes this year, teachers are given too much content to teach in 180 days, especially with so many variables of events. Things such as snow days and sicknesses cause a light panic for the teachers, and the resulting work annoys the student body. It would really make things a lot easier for students to design their own individual projects than be assigned a mass-produced rubric and checklist on the last day of school.

Students get a large amount of information in the course of a single day, ranging from how to calculate compound interest to learning how WWI changed warfare as we knew it. I can tell you with 100 percent certainty that all of that information is forgotten about by the next morning, and the information gets lost. If summer break is three months long, imagine how easily the information will be forgotten if they have to do a structured, formulaic, factory-style requirements list that is three months of ordinary school content. They would learn nothing from it, and waste three months. If they get to design their own project, however, they get to set their own deadlines and set up the requirements so they actually do learn something, which is the whole purpose of the project.

Personally, I would like to say that a summer project of any kind is a bad idea. If the law of the land decrees that a summer project should be assigned to the students, let the students design their own projects. It will help them actually learn about their interests, in their own way. Teachers will be able to worry about one less thing. I got to design my own project once, and ended up making a movie about genetics and the brain's abilities, and it was probably my favorite project ever, because I got to learn about something that I waned to learn about and present it in a way that I enjoyed. There is no better feeling than getting to demonstrate your abilities and strengths for something you care about. Believe me, I have looked, but nothing comes close.",5,Summer projects,Independent
A82F551BD455,"I think is good idea to continue learning during their break because if we take this project we are ready to the next year to do anything example if you don't take this project you never be ready to the next year and you get F on you all class first , I think this can help me to better my self and better make the work in the school second , I think that everyone need take this project because this can help you to go better the next year to the high school in third reason i ask about the people don't like this project because they want to pass summer with his family but another people they wanned working all summer to get money and, I think is good idea, but when you working to much you don't wanned continue the high school and you leave the school because i have friend they started working and when we start again the high school they leave because they prefer the money and they don't continue studying.

I think this can help me to better my self and this can help you to go better the next year to the high school but there are people don't like this project because they want to pass summer with his family but another people they wanned working all summer to get money and we needed the high school because if we garduate we can go at the college or take a good work after high school.

In my conclusion I think we needed take this project because if we take we're ready to continue the high school the next year and I think that if we make this project we never to procupate for you next year the teacher they just wanned help you to your future and yourself.",2,Summer projects,Independent
47AAA199994F,"Over the summer, schools believe that handing out summer projects is beneficial to a student's learning. This is because over the summer, students tend to forget what they have learned that year. Thus, when they return from their vacation, they struggle to comprehend the material. Many students dread the idea of having summer projects since it can take up a lot of time on someone's hands. When someone thinks of summer, they think of fun and freedom from the prison they call ""school"". Summer projects are highly recommended though, because they help the student's brain maintain the information they learned. These projects should be student based, because students would be more likely to do the project and it lets their creativity shine through.

An issue that many students see is that projects over the summer tend to be banal. This causes them to give up right away and not complete it. For example, I was given a project over the summer for English. It was very uninteresting because there was just an essay to do. Since this project was bland, I did not feel like doing it. It was dreadful to sit at a computer and write a long essay. There was nothing engaging about the assignment that could make a me inspired to write. The assignment ended up being useless, because it did not help me retain any information and it did not help me be prepared for the upcoming school year. Helping design the projects can help that student become better in school since the project that they would be designing would be beneficial to them.

Using creativity is one of the most important things for growth as a student. The left part of the brain is where all the creativity is stored. I have noticed how in schools there are not many classes or activities that let that side of the brain function. A good way for it to work is to let the projects be the outlet of all that thinking process. As an example, in my communications class, we always make videos and learn how to edit. My teacher one day let us do a video project. This meant that it could be about whatever our hearts wanted. Our videos could be a documentary, a music video, a scary movie, etc. We got to run our own projects. I chose to do a documentary about a singer in our school. This project let my ideas flow onto what I was making. I enjoyed to do the project because I was doing what I had envisioned. The difference between the teacher based project and the student based project is that it gave us the freedom to think outside the box. That odyssey of doing a project that us students designed was an experience that helped apply our knowledge.

Teacher designed projects though, do have its benefits as well. They are designed to help every student. When teachers come up with these projects they make sure that every detail can somehow help them prepare for the upcoming year. That way, when the students come back in the fall, they would have already had a preview of the material and won't be so behind. These assignments usually flow into different assignments. For example, an English essay can flow into a Socratic seminar. An issue that could come up with student designed learning is that, the students may design a project that does not require much effort or learning. This could become a grave issue when it is time to come back for classes. Hence, the teachers must give a project that will make the students learn.

Student designed projects is an idea that should be considered. The amount of students that would do the projects would increase. This would make the students more engaged in what they are doing and will make them learn something from it. The projects would be designed for them and they would not have trouble completing it. These summer projects do not have to seem dreadful, they can be percieved as a fun learning experience. The education system should put in place a choice for schools to let students design their own assignments over the summer. Student designed summer projects should be permitted because students would do the projects, and it would let their creativity shine.",5,Summer projects,Independent
A2EED30DD075,"In my opinion , I say that us students should have the offer too have school projects. The examples im gonna provide is too say why we should have these projects over the summer because they can give us a topic about what we did over the summer as a project. for examples , this can bring so many students grades up and ill teach us about what each students did over the summer by looking at there project by including pictures and so many more details. Also , this will be a fun activity that everyone will enjoy around the world.

In addition , you wouldnt really need summer school anymore for some other students. This can provide them too move up to the next grade level by providing them with these school projects. All you gotta do is give them a topic about what they did over summer and it can most likely make them succeed , all they gotta do is provide pictures , details , and have something too do with the subjects that they learn in school such as english , math , and science included in the project. it can bring us all together and closer as a school if we did something like this.

Furthermore , you can even provide a reward when school starts again. It can be a first , second , and a third place winner , the prize should be of any students choosing such as a ten dollar gift card too their favorite fast food restaurant. this will make students want too try even harder and wanna compete with each other of who got the best and coolest project out of everyone. also , we can all get in front of the class to show off are talent and decorations too all the teachers and staff. To continue , this would be a huge opportunity too us students that we will mighty enjoy.

In conclusion , I have provide details and examples on why this type of thing should happen all around the country. it can bring so many communities and schools all around the world and provided students a way too stay out of trouble and a cool activity for everyone too do as a project. hopefully staff and teachers look in too this activity cause might I say , I would enjoy too be apart off designing a project of what I did over the summer.",2,Summer projects,Independent
A6E455DE5D74,"The sun is blazing, what a great day to go to the pool. That isn't an option because instead high school students need to make sure they meet check points for their summer break project. Assignments that are given to over summer break should be student designed. If projects are student designed they can work it around their schedule better, play to their learning style, and be motivated.

Over the summer everyone has some sort of plan. Whether its family vacation, a job, or studying for the SAT, there is always one hectic part during summer break. With projects in the mix too it can get chaotic juggling it all. If students are allowed to create their own schedule and check points to better work around their summer, the more likely it is for the assignment to be finished. This summer I went to Africa for a month to a remote village to help build a school. For the entire month I could not have any connection to anything, since service was 4 hours away. The reason why I didn't sign up for AP's was because I would not have been able to turn in my work by those checkpoints. If I had been able to have the single requirement of having it all done before school started I would be in AP classes right now. While some assignments may be created by teachers to make sure their students actually get their work done, it can end up hurting more than helping. If students are allowed design their own checkpoints for summer assignments the results would turn out better.

Every student learns differently. Whether they are a kinetic or aural learner there is no way to tailor an education style to target everyone. If students were given a broad topic such as do research on the Peruvian rebellions during the 1970's, it gives students the freedom to tailor to their own needs. They would be learning the same topic, just taking different routes to get there. In marching band we were given a similar concept. When learning and teaching people how to march it can be difficult to get this learn this new technique of walking. We walk everyday, so to break this habit can be difficult. Some rookies need to be taught by telling what they need to do, while others would prefer that they learn how to do it by watching an example. Everyone learns in a different way, and if students are able to design their own way of learning, it can lead to better understanding their summer assignment.

No history teacher gets excited reading an essay that their student was very obviously not devoted to. The same applies to students. Students do not want to spend their one big break from school studying a topic they aren't motivated in. When students are forced to do something motivation goes out the window. The final result is not pleasureable for a kid to do, and not something a teacher will want to grade and give feedback on. An example I've often heard is that whenever students are assigned a book that they must read, it can make the experience of not as enjoyable. This happened to me my freshman year. We were reading

To Kill a Mocking Bird . I purposefully had waited to read it because I wanted it to give my own, fresh analysis when we discussed in class. When the first quiz came I was excited to write down the points that I had come up with. The actual test questions were all based on small details that would have to be memorized in order to get the correct answers. I was so terrified that I wasn't going to do well on the quizzes that instead of reading and enjoying myself, I was stuck trying to memorize information so I wouldn't fail that quarter. I didn't enjoy reading anymore and by the end of the unit I had stopped reading the book entirely. There was nothing I was gaining from memorizing lines, and I had no motivation to do that. If students are allowed to design their own over the summer projects they can tailor it to what they most enjoy. I'm sure there are some that like to see where the author wants the book to be taken, while others prefer to read a book and see what they grasp from it. The more students are able to enjoy their work the more motivated they will be to learn.

Some may say that it is better that the summer assignments are teacher designed, that way it is confirmed that everyone learns the information they need to by the time they need to do it. This teaches nothing to students. Later on in life they will not have a textbook to read on how to solve their problems, they will need to be creative and navigate their way through on their own. This can apply to personal issues or in the work place too. Students need to start learning more about themselves and how they work. There is no better time to learn then when they have adults that can help them when they need

Time management, motivation, and learning styles are all things students need to learn about themselves. For over the summer assignments students should be allowed to design their own projects so that it works best for them. These are all skills they will need to learn eventually, so why not let them start figuring it out now?",6,Summer projects,Independent
F12B4BDEEED4,"Summer projects for students are comparable to working on vacation for adults. They are meaningless in a sense, as they don't prepare for the classes being taken the following school year. They shouldn't be assigned by teachers because most of the time the assignments don't get done because of the lack of interest in the subject. Instead, students should be able to choose their own projects, and it shouldn't have to be put on a big poster that takes hours to complete, or a lengthy powerpoint that the student doesn't even believe the teacher will look through completely. Students should be able to explore their interests as they please without the burden of completing an assignment outside of school.

Most students don't feel like taking the time out of their summer to complete a teacher assigned project due to their lack of interest in the subject, it feels like a waste of time to them, and rightfully so. The projects should be less about the physical work and more about actually learning and enlightening themselves with a topic that fits their interests. If a teacher were to assign a book report for over the summer, they should be able to choose what book they want to read. Of course certain criteria with the book should be met such as page length and genre, but the actual book itself should be chosen by the student. Not everybody wants to read ""beautiful literary pieces"" such as

"" Huckleberry Fin""

or

""To Kill a Mockingbird""

, not everybody wants to go through a book trying to analyze and completely understand the foreign language being spoken in some of these books, and not everybody wants to annotate each and every paragraph from every single page of the book. Students just want to enjoy what they're reading as it makes it a lot easier to report back to your teacher if you enjoyed the project, opposed to someone who absolutely hated it.

Summer projects altogether should be optional for students. A lot of people travel over the summer, play sports, or do other things that make them very busy. They don't want to be in California having an amazing time but still have that school project lingering in the back of their mind, it just ruins the vacation for them. Teachers wouldn't like to be on vacation and worried about grading the papers of 180 or so students, so students deserve the same respect during their time off as well. A lot of students also work summer jobs too, which means even more of their ""break"" is being taken from them. It's summer break and the weight of school should be lifted off of their shoulders for just three months. Teachers have the other nine months to assign things, don't wait until we finish the school year to do so.

It's understood that students are given these assignments to ""further their education"", but to the student it doesn't really feel like they're learning anything from it. It just feels like some more work the teacher is handing them that needs to be completed at a certain time. In what way is that beneficial to the student? Asking students to conduct a little research on their own is a lot more educationally beneficial than having them do a full on project. On top of that it shouldn't be mandatory. A student is more likely to go look something up on their phone or laptop once the get home if the topic is just suggested to them, not being forced upon them. If they find it interesting then maybe they could actually complete a project on the subject, but that should be at their discretion. the ""fun-factor"" plays a big role in whether or not a student is learning. The thirst for more knowledge because they are intrigued with a topic woukd produce better results and less stress with the project.

If a summer project is to be teacher-designed, students should be given a wide array of options to choose from on how to go about this project. They shouldn't be forced to write a 5 page essay or have a 10 minute presentation or create a 30 slide powerpoint. There's many ways to express our knowledge but we get limited by the normalities of modern presentation. Students could sing a song, draw a portrait, give a speech, there's so many options to choose from.

The entire summer project should be left up to the student. The topic, the presentation method, maybe even the due date as long as it's within a reasonable amount of time. It shouldn't feel like weight on a student's shoulders as it should be fun and exciting, as teachers should want it to be. If the assignment is given, it shouldn't be mandatory because not everyone has the luxury of free time over the sumer. Some students may travel a lot and others could be helping their parents or siblings with a family-run business. Teachers also had the entire nine months that we're in school for to assign the project, so they should not wait until our time off to give us something that might not even matter in the upcoming year. The idea of a summer project is just pointless as it's just used to keep studetns in ""school-mode"" for the entire year. It usually takes about a week or two for students to become re-acclimated with school after summer break is over so that can't even be a reason as to why the projects are given.       ",3,Summer projects,Independent
C3D8E8E8B942,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-desdigned or students-designed?

These summer projects should be student-designed for varies reasons such as, engagment, vaction, and lastly, confidence.

Students during the summer have many things to worry about like having a job, looking after siblings or even their mental health and the last thing on their mind is a techer-designed project. The projects given throughout the summer should be student-designed becuase it allows the student to be engaged. The student will be more engaged because it is a topic that they want to learn about and being engaged shows that the student is willing to learn and is very intrested in his or her own topic. Typically, when a teacher assigns a project to a student, the student isn't very pleased and with that being said, it could affect the amount of effort and the desire that the students puts into actually learning.

Secondly, these projects also need to be student-designed because of summer experiences. During the summer, alot of students grow. Vaction plays a big role in the students growth and development, as the students travel they pick up more and more knowledge, which expands their knowldege and could possibly change thier perception of things, making it easier for them to have better ideas and to do well on their summer projects.

Lastly, student-designed projects over break leads to confidence. Because the student has had the freedom of choosing what he or she wants to learn about, it just makes it easier for the students to showcase their work with pride. Pride meaning, showing that the student has learned and is more than comfortable to enlighten others. To have confidence about what you have put alot of time into and worked on is an important skill to develop because the student will surely use it some other time in their lifetime.

In conclusion, these summer projects should be student-designed because it will surely keep the student engaged in his or her own learning and add a little more excitement to the students vacation because the project is something they are eager to learn and work on. Lastly student-designed projects will help build the students confidence because they know what they are talking about.                                                    ",4,Summer projects,Independent
511ED4952D93,"Summer's here and you want to rest, tan at the beach, and shop with friends. However, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These assignments may be teacher-designed or student-designed, but there may be problems that could arise when the project is student-designed. Teacher-designed projects are more easy to understand and accurate.

Students don't always know the curriculum for the school year, which makes it a lot difficult for them to design an entire summer project. For example, let's say it was a project for math. The student may make a mistake on the assignment because they don't know what the correct answer was, which will also confuse the student who is working on the assignment, and give them the wrong information. It's also harder for the student to plan out which problems to place in the beginning or the end. However, for teachers, it's not a whole lot simpler, but it's still a lot easier for them try to figure things out. They should know at least a gist of what they would teach throughout the school year, and put problems on the project that'll help the students practice material. Teacher-designed projects more planned out in preparance for the school year.

Teacher-designed materials are more easily understood than student-designed assignments. Students aren't as experienced in formatting things as well as teachers are. Teachers have been teaching for a while so they know how they should word the questions in order to help their students understand the questions fully. Student-designers on the other hand, may have a bit of trouble wording. It's important for the student who is working on the project to be able to understand even just the question in order to solve it, but if the question is complicated, then just solving one problem could take more time than necessary than if the teacher had created the question instead in the first place.

In conclusion, teacher-designed projects are way more effective than student-designed ones. They are easy to understand, and more accurate than the projects students could've made. Teachers help format questions easily, and know how to create the project in the first place, to help prepare for the school year throughout the summer. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
BEB1900622E4,"During summer break a student is very likely to lose touch of their skills since they will not be attending school on a regular basis for a long period of time. That is why some schools are beginning to introduce a series of summer projects for students to keep their minds in check over summer break. There are many benefits to having these summer projects,but hence the question should these projects be designed by teachers or should students themselves design these projects. Although having a summer projected designed by a teacher would allow the teacher to grade the projects more efficiently as they would be on the same subject, having students design their own projects for summer break is better because students will turn in better quality projects and be more enthusiastic about completing them since they can choose a topic that interest them, teachers will enjoy receiving a variety of interesting projects to grade, and students choosing a summer project can use it to better benefit themselves as a whole.

To begin with, student should be able to choose their own summer projects because they will be more enthusiastic and turn in better quality projects since they can choose a topic that interest them. If a student were to be given an assignment during the regular school year they normally would not be able to choose the basis of it , but would be entrusted with turning in a quality project even if they did not enjoy doing it. Giving students the opportunity to choose a project that caters to the interest of them surely will be one of good quality. More likely than not a person whom is doing something that they enjoy will have an urge to do more of whatever they are doing, so translating that over to education doing more on a project will definitely make the quality better and they will surely be excited to complete it. For example, a student who enjoys fishing would turn in a much better project of much better quality on the amount of a striped walleye salmon in the Colombia river, rather than having to do a project on counting how many times the Yakima Washington fire department responds to a four alarm fire. To summarize, students should be able to choose their own summer projects because they will be more enthusiastic about completing them and turn in better quality projects.

Furthermore, having students choose their own summer projects is better because teachers will enjoy grading a variety of different topics. Giving one singular topic for every student to do a project on must be boring to grade for the teacher, but giving projects to students that they can choose can let the teacher learn more about their students. For example, if students in a 10th grade class were assigned a summer project of counting the average number of meadowlarks in an Oklahoma corn field before sundown by their teacher they surely would not enjoy sitting outside counting birds all day long. Now some people may like watching meadowlarks in a corn field, but if a group of students who played cricket could choose their own project they would choose the average number of pegs caught in a single game. Cricket is definitely an interesting sport to play and watch , so while grading the project the teacher could discover that some students in the school enjoy cricket and the teacher could start a cricket club. Now think, of all the different projects student could turn in if they could choose their own project. To summarize, allowing students to choose their own summer projects is better because teachers will enjoy grading a variety of interesting topics.

Finally, students should be allowed to choose their own summer projects because they can use the project to benefit themselves for the better. During the summers many students are either working at jobs like life guarding, or playing club sports like volleyball or soccer. Giving students the opportunity to choose their own project could also free up time for students to be able to get more done. If students were to be given a tedious project like measuring the amounts of bi phenol A in milk jugs or a project that required arduous labor, like making trails for a local boy scout camp they would have little time left in the day to work a shift at the pool or go to soccer practice. For example, if a student played soccer during the summers they could do their project on the average amount of times the soccer ball hits the crossbar in one hundred shots. This project would more than likely be enjoyed by the students, but also the student could use the project as a benefit and work on their shooting skills if they were to do a project based on soccer. To summarize, student should be allowed to choose their own summer projects because they can use the project to benefit themselves.

To conclude, giving students the opportunity to choose their own summer projects is better because they will be more willing to turn in a better quality project since they can choose something that interest them, teachers will enjoy reading about things that interest students from a variety of projects , and students can use these projects to benefit themselves and free up their summer schedule Doing a project that interests a student will surely be an interesting project to look at and definelty one to get a good grade. What do you say, if you were to be given a summer project choose something that will interest you not somethig generic and boring.   ",5,Summer projects,Independent
F21CBEE52702,"In certain schools they have a required summer project that is either teacher designed or student designed.

My position is the students should design these project because students have a bigger imagination, and if we create the project we're more likely to do it. I will get into more detail as i continue.

Some schools require a summer project, and my position states that students should design these projects because students have a bigger imagination than teachers. My reasoning for that statement is we're still young and we see stuff more different than adults. For example picture a little boy and a forty year old man the little boy imagination is something you wouldn't expect, and the old man imagination and creativity isn't really on point like the little boy. But the little boy has all these ideas that one day can save the world, my point is you expanding your mind just a little bit can produce one of the best ideas. Which is why i think students should design these projects because of our imagination which can expand into a different realm and create a great idea for a project which more students would want to do because a student created it and the creativity put into it will attract us students.

Therefor If students created this project we are going to more likely want to do it. Because the fact that the students created it that alone would push students to want to do it more. Seeing your peers create a project that you can relate too would also push you to do it. Us younger people use social media as a outlet to sell things etc... but if we put the project design on social media, and catch our peers attention and they like it. More and more students would complete or at least try because of the creativity and it was a peer telling you, not no commanding teacher.

I would choose students to create this summer project design. Because the fact that if a peer put it out there and is creating it we're more likely going to do it. We think differnet we reach into the non reality part of life and make it reality. I also agree with the fact that our imagination is way bigger then teachers because what were used to seeing on television etc.. anything could be possible from what we've seen so far in our life.",4,Summer projects,Independent
7AEBFE7B59D1,"Students around the country are forced to work on a summer project after school finishes. Most schools in the country assign summer projects so the students don't forget what they learned in the school year. But recently students are asking if they can design on how they do their summer project because they think it would be better for them. Although some may believe otherwise, Teachers know what the student needs to know for next year, Teachers have access to materials that students need, and Teachers can grade the summer project fairly prove that summer projects should be teacher-designed.

Teachers know what students need to know for next year. When a teacher assigns a summer project to a student it's so that the student is prepared for next year. If a student designed their own summer project they will not be prepared for next year. However, some students say that they will be more prepared if they design their summer project. But while making their summer project they could get stuck and their won't be any help on how to fix the problem.

Teachers have access to materials that students need. If a teacher gives a student a packet full of questions for their summer project. It's most likely a combination of questions from a teacher workbook. But some students will say that they can find their own workbook to use. However, teacher workbooks have more in-depth concepts while a regular workbook has the basic ideas.

Teachers can grade the summer project fairly if they assign it. Teachers that give out summer projects have a checklist of what the project should have on it. But if a student turns in a student-designed project. The teacher wouldn't know how to grade it because all the other student-designed projects will be different. But some students might say that they could follow a rough checklist. However, a rough checklist could miss a few details that could be important in what they are learning.

Teachers knows what information the student would need for next year. Also teachers have access to workbooks that students don't have access to. Finally teachers can grade the summer project fairly as well are reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student-designed.",3,Summer projects,Independent
89B939843B8D,"I think that student designed summer projects are more beneficial. It's easier for them to express themselves and their imagination. When making the project the student will find a topic that is interesting to them. By finding an interesting topic, themselves as students, make it a lot easier for them to express their ideas. If the topic and design of the project is chosen by the students, its more understood and well put for them.

When creating the projects the students really use their imagination. The fact of creating something themselves is exciting. Once they have found something interesting that they enjoy presenting about, it is easier for them to find the information needed. When students are interested in their projects, they more than likely do better. Because their imaginations are intrigued by the interesting information, students enjoy working on the projects they have chosen. More effort is put into projects when students fully understand the concept of the topic and design.

If students have a better understanding of what there doing, they are most likely to try harder. If something is not understood by a student they may loose interest in it and eventually give up. By designing their project and choosing their topic, the students will know what there project is on and how they need to present it. Some students feel the need to give up or just not even try, when they do not understand or like what their project is on.

Teachers should not design the students summer projects, because many students can feel pressured and stressed to meet a teachers goals and standards for their project. The students worry that they will not have the right information or even enough. Some students feel that there is just simply too much information that the teacher is asking for. That being said those students who think that would do the project, but would not complete it.

I think that student designed summer projects are better for the learning of students. It gives students room to learn. They are able to use their imagination to the fullest. When designing a project a student can express how they feel or think on a particular topic. Giving students this opportunity to design their own summer projects, is a great idea to help show them their responsibilities and their abilities. ",3,Summer projects,Independent
7BCFD0C9880F,"Summer Project: Student-designed or Teacher-designed?

Many schools across the country have been questioning whether or not they should be assigning their students summer projects. It is understood that many schools believe that it will be a way for the students to continue their learning throughout their break. While schools should not assign projects over breaks because it takes away from the break itself, if they must be assigned, students should be able to pick what they would wish to accomplish. If schools require students to complete summer projects they should be self-designed because students can be creative in what they would like to do, they can demonstrate something that interests them, and they can be self-paced.

If schools require students to complete summer projects they should be self-designed so that students can be creative in what they choose to do. If students are given a self- designed project then they would be able to create that project however they choose and it would be more beneficial to their learning if they were able to do what they chose. There are endless possibilities on projects ones could do to demonstrate a topic such as: a poster, a slide show, a song, a movie, and so many more. If one is able to be creative with the project then they would work harder on it regardless of the break.

If schools require students to complete summer projects they should be self-designed so that students can demonstrate something that interests them. If students are given the option of what to do the project on then they would be more likely to complete it if they could do whatever topic they wished. Not only that but when they are given the choice they will be able to educate something that interests them. Students could do anything that may interest them; a cause, something they did not learn in school, or a topic they wish to have further learning about. Giving students a project over the summer seems somewhat cruel, however, when given the choice, students could have endless possibilities on what to do for said project.

If schools require students to complete summer projects they should be self-designed so that the students have the opportunity to be self paced. Summer is supposed to be a break time to allow for rest and fun, so what child would want a project hanging over their head all summer. But if this project was able to be self-paced then it would allow for endless summer fun without the stress of deadlines. A self-paced project would allow for students to still enjoy summer because it is understood that vacations, traveling, work, and many other factors may get in the way. However with a self-paced project those factors would not get in the way. It is understood that some would argue that a deadline makes that child work, in some cases yes, however, most of the time it only allows for more unneeded stress that children do not need over the summer.

In conclusion if schools require students to complete summer projects they should be self-designed because students can be creative in what they would like to do, they can demonstrate something that interests them, and they can be self-paced. Not only would it allow for children to learn about something that they are interested in, but it also allows for good mental health over the summer due to the lack of extra unneeded stress. Having student-designed projects also allows for the students to have a voice in their school community and to feel heard if they are able to create a project for themselves. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
5.20E+11,"The summer projects should be student designed because it can give more freedom and creativity for what the projects could be and how they can be done. If the project were to be designed by a teacher, then the student may have more of a difficult time doing it and struggle with motivation for it. For example: I myself struggle with motivation, and if I were to be given a summer project that was designed by a teacher, it may make me want to do it less and can also create a more difficult challenge because I won't know how exactly they may want to see it done. I have also seen other students complain when a teacher gave them a summer project and they weren't allowed to choose what they can do it on. Not only that, but the other issue (as it was mentioned a few sentences ago) was also doing it only how the teacher wanted it and the students complained that they wanted to do something more creative and if they were given allowed to, they'd pick something that interested them more and it would've looked much better than what they were limited to.

Generally things like projects, especially summer ones, should allow the students to design them. Because that much freedom may allow the student to grow up with more creativity inside them. While it being teacher designed, the real creativity/freedom goes away, or at least that what it may end up feeling like. Overall, especially over the summer, students should be allowed to have more fun with things like that. And giving them that libirty ends up taking less of that summer fun and relaxation away. The prompts should still be checked by the teacher to see if what the student has chosen is school appropriate, but other than that, students should indeed be allowed to design said summer projects. ",3,Summer projects,Independent
31F4831C794D,"Student-designed summer projects would be more beneficial than teacher-designed because Students will have a wide variety of options to choose from,Freedom to expresss themselves and their resources will be known.

First reason is because of the different things studnets can do and they won't have teachers convincing them of what they want to see. Back then when I was in 4th grade almost every other weekend my aunt would take my cousin,brother and I to this frozen yougurt place in Generic_City. The place was called frozen frog or something like that and we would just try all of the flavors when we got a chance it was amazing but we only could fill up the cup plus the toppings that we wanted,so we went ahead and made our choices and we said we would try something new the next time we went to that shop. Just like students we had the choice to do what we wanted to pick and get it done without someone else telling me to do what they wanted us to do.

Furthermore because students choose what they want their project to be about they also know their limits. When I first started playing Mortal Kombat 11. I was so excited to try out all the new and old characters and see what new things they can do. I told myself I want to try and use different characters than the ones I use constantly. So I do so and realize that I never really play with Generic_Name or Generic_Name for some reason but then when I tried using them in a real fight it never really worked out. So I had convinced myself that it was all because I never learned their moves but then something hit me it wasn't that i haven't mastered their moves in such a small amont of time it was because their moves were just the same as Mortal Kombat X and I am not really good at working with close ranged fighters. My specialty was at fighting with those who can attack at any distance. Zoners were my best bet at winning any match. Also like students allowing people to see their limits can help others know what they are good at and what they aren't and they won't feel troubled because of a few minor things that were out of their control stop them from doing their job.

Final reason is because students are already limited on what they have to do in school,so why should they be limited on a project that the teacher has required them to do. Truthfully it is just another way to tell someone no to doing this or that or it is a continuation of limiting people on their creativity. Back in 6th grade most people had a problem with the art tecaher because she had such strict rules in a way it was either her way or the highway. No one could really understand why she had us doing things this way or that way. With that being said everyone was hoping that one day she would actually miss a day and one day she called out but then I looked around me everyone was having a fun time because they could express themselves through their art. All students need to be able to express themselves without having someone telling them that they are doing things wrong.

However I know that some people might say that is not true and if we allow students to do whatever they feel like doing then how are we suppose to make them do anything educational and how do you think it is going to help them in life. My answer to that is allow some type of creativity in their life because you cannot tell me that you expect students to be told later on in the future to do this and this tep by step. That is never gonna happen no one is ever gonna hold another persons hand all the days of their life thta is why they need a bit of freedom =now so they can have some experience with it when they get older.

In Conclusion,Allow studnets to have freedom in their life without having to be forced to do things,Students will have a wide variety of options and their limits are know through their experiences.    ",4,Summer projects,Independent
BCF931098966,"Students are in school for almost ten months of year. They are constantly doing work that has been assigned by teachers, even if they do not enjoy doing it. Students have no desire to do these assignments because the assignments were designed by teachers and are not of interest to the students. They do not have any motivation to complete a boring project for school. When students get assigned a project to do over the summer, they are burnt out from all the work they have done for the past ten months; furthermore, when the teacher designs the project for them, many students refuse to do it. This leads to students not learning at all over their break. Summer projects should be student designed because students will be able to have a better learning experience, have more free time and fun with the project, and do what they enjoy over the summer.

Many students find it difficult to learn from projects and assignments that are given by teachers. Students are not able to remain focused because they are struggling to understand the project and its purpose. Designing their own projects would help students understand what they are learning and give them a better learning experience. In the television show Phineas and Ferb, the two boys are not good learners in school. They struggle to learn from worksheets and tests; however, they are the smartest kids in their neighborhood during the summer. They design their own projects and learn from what they are doing. They learn from the hands on experience and doing the type of activities and projects that they want to do over the summer. Phineas and Ferb have worked on many projects, and their learning environment and learning experience is improved because they get to work on what they want. Many students will be able to benefit like this because learning will be easier when they design their own projects.

During the summer, students want to go on vacation, hang out with their friends, and enjoy their break away from school. When the teacher assigns a project, a lot of their free time gets taken away. Instead of having fun and being with friends, they are stuck indoors because they have to finish the project. If students get to design the project for themselves, they will be able to plan it according to their summer schedule. They will know the exact time it will take them to complete the project, so they will be able to spend more time doing what they enjoy. The projects will be less confusing and challenging to the student, which will give them the free time they deserve so they can have fun during their summer. My freshman year of high school, my biology class teacher assigned me a project and a partner for my Scientific Research Project. It took me about two months to complete the project and I had lost my whole break because of it. I did not enjoy doing it at all; therefore, I did not learn much from the project and did not get a good grade on it. The next year, my sophomore year of high school, my chemistry teacher allowed us to design our projects and select our partners for the same type of project. This time I enjoyed working on the project because I got to design it all with my partner. We were able to finish this project in less than a week because we enjoyed what we were doing and wanted to learn from it. I gained a lot more knowledge from this project and ,therefore, got a better grade than before. Giving students more freedom on their projects improves their learning and allows them to have more free time over the summer.

Teachers may say that teacher generated projects are better because they have more learning content and make it more fair when grading them, but this is not fair to the students who have to spend their summer doing a project. Students should be able to pick what they enjoy doing and learning. They should be allowed to generate their own projects so they can enjoy themselves over the summer and still be learning. In the movie Lemonade Mouth, the teachers and principal tell the group of students that they can not do what they enjoy. They try to make them learn sports and learn things that they are not good at. This causes them to struggle in school. When one teacher allows the group to form a band and do what they love and enjoy, they start to thrive in school. Their grades improve, they become more popular, and they are doing what they love. This happens because a teacher allowed them to do what they enjoy, instead of telling them the exact way to work on a project. The teacher let them choose what they wanted to do, and because of it they learned how to succeed and how to enjoy school.

A majority of a students' year is spent in school. Summer break is very short, so they do not get much time at home. Teachers, however, still decide to assign projects and work that students will not enjoy doing over the summer. Teachers want their students to keep learning over the summer, and because of this, they take away students freedoms outside of school. Summer projects are not fun for students because they want to be enjoying their summer with their friends, not working on schoolwork; however, summer projects could be improved if schools allowed them to be generated by the students. Summer work should be created by students because it will allow them to enjoy what they work on, improve the quality of learning, and give them more time for themselves and friends. Students make plans over the summer to be with friends and family. Schools should respect students plans and free time by allowing summer projects to be student designed.",6,Summer projects,Independent
DEEB40F3A79D,"Dear Generic_Name,

I hope this letter finds you and the school staff members okay. The reason I'm writing this letter to you and our school staff members its because I would like our summer projects to be designed by the students. I believe summer projects should be students-designed because that helps students to have the opportunity to express their opinions and ideas about their previous school year. Most students travel out of the country or state. The 30% of the students stay home and prefer to spend time with family and friends.

Students have the opportunity to express their thoughts about their previous year. For example during my summer break I love to write about my previous school year experience and think about what were the wrong decisions I made during that year that helps me to set a goal to do it better the next school year.

Most students travel out of the state or country. For example my cousins, they love to draw and describe what they see in each state or country every time they travel, they love to talk about their experience in each state which is a good things because they are really communicative with school and the community.

The 30% of the students stay at home during their summer break and they prefer to spend time with family and friends. For example my brother stays home most of the time during the summer break and most he invites his friends to come over, they spend time playing with their PS4 but also they like to write letter to members of their family like grandparents etc: also they love to do animal researches so based on that they are able to take notes, make observations and make comments about animals in the forest.

Thank you for taking the time to read my suggestions and I hope I did convience you that summer projects should be student-designed.

937519C972A0,"Some schools throughout the world believe in learning year-round. They think that learning is vital, not only in the 9-10 months there is school, but in the summer as well. To overcome the blockade of learning that is the 2-3 months that students are not in school, schools require students to complete summer projects to insure that they continue their learning during their breaks. Although some people may argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed to ensure that students will be motivated to do their work, summer projects that would be completed over break should be student-designed because students would feel more motivated to accomplish them and their creativity would be increased with their unique ideas being expressed.

Students would be more motivated to accomplish something if they have created it and are interested in the subject. People in general are more inclined to doing an activity that is interesting to them than doing a boring task that they have no interest in whatsoever. For example, students who are very interested in music and participate in band at school would be more motivated to perform well in band than a gym class, where their interest does not lie. Many times, schools do not offer the opportunity for students to create something in class that genuinely interests them, so they are less inclined to do their best on the assignments they receive. If given the chance to do a project in a way that they are good at while researching something that is interesting to them, most, if not all, students would take that opportunity over an assignment they have to do a teacher's way. Also, it is not fair to students to assign large projects over the summer that will effect their grades. If schools want students to continue learning over their breaks, it is necessary that it is done in a way where students do not feel as if their time is being wasted or that they dread doing a teacher-designed assignment. This can be easily avoided by allowing students to design their own projects to motivate them.

Students learn better when they are stimulated mentally and actively engaged in the activity at hand because their creativity is flowing. Some schools may argue that if teachers are not designing their projects, students might create something inappropriate or too abstract, and outside of school's strict guidelines. In reality, if given proper guidelines from a teacher, students will follow these, but will be given the chance to create something unique to them. They will more likely be engaged in their work, which will accomplish a school's goal of students learning in the summer.

The counterargument to the idea that students should design their own projects is the notion that teachers should have the responsibility of designing summer break projects. Although some schools may want this because it ensures that all students are doing the same topic and main idea under a teachers' control, it is more beneficial to have students come up with their own ideas. An example of when student-designed projects are more beneficial to students and peers is in a science fair. In a science fair, each student receives the same general guidelines while designing their projects, but their ideas are creative and unique. Students are able to create and execute their own interesting ideas, but they are still in the boundaries of what a teacher wants them to be learning from the experience.

Although many people do not think about summer projects often, they are a topic that should be carefully discussed in schools. To accomplish their goals of having students be engaged academically throughout the year, it is beneficial for schools to have students create their own projects. This would allow students to express more creativity, be proud of what they have created, and not dread doing their summer assignments. Through designing their own summer assignments and projects, students will be learning and stimulating their minds in ways that would not be possible if forced to complete projects designed by their teachers. ",6,Summer projects,Independent
D02E77657183,"Students should have teacher-designed projects over the summer, over student-designed projects, because if it is a student-designed project there is a high chance that it won't get done. Also teacher-designed projects give the student more information on how they would want the project,and student-designed projects take more work to complete.

If it is a student-designed project it most likely won't be done or it will be rushed. When I was in middle school I always used to get student-designed projects assigned to me by my teachers. Every time I got them I never started the day that it was given out because since it was student-designed I thought I had all the time in the world to do it,so I waited until the night before it was due to start it and I thought it was always decent to pass with. But i was wrong I failed most of them or got a low passing grad, because i didn't take all the time i was given to talk to my teacher,get a good planning going or have time to go over the project. Students shouldn't make there own projects because that gives them a good chance to stall on doing it.

Also student-designed projects makes the student have to start from scratch because your teacher wants you to make the directions and then make the project. That makes the student thinks more over the summer that makes him/her not want to do it because summer is the time when they want to relax and just enjoy there selves .Last week i had a project to do for my computer class, I had to give direction on how i had to manage my money in an power point. I was exhausted after because I had other classes I had to do work and the project had me up late at night trying to do parts at a time. Student-designed projects shouldn't be making students exhausted just by starting from scratch.

Another thing teacher-designed projects are easier, because they already have the direction that tells the students how they would want them to do it by giving clear information and telling them how to complete it and get a good grade. My 9th grade year we had a book report project it was easy because the teacher that wrote it gave all the information on how to make a great book report and it wasn't difficult, it gave clear information for us to read a book then write about what it was about then if we liked the book or not. It was easy and quick instruction rather then trying to get us to make a book. Teacher-designed projects actually are a good way for students to get a good grade on any kind of project.

Schools should require students to have teacher-designed projects to give the student good instructions and not be difficult with the assignment.             ",4,Summer projects,Independent
C977338F6A53,"It has been proven, that schools that have summer projects verse schools that don't have on average a 15% higher testing average on finnal exams. All schools, except year around schools, have a nine week period where students are given a break from school and enjoy doing other activitys. During the summer many student take a break from school and explore more intrest, or get a summer job, or some even travel, ect. While summer can be a great experience for students, many students tend to lose valuable information that they learn the year prior. This causes teacher to have to review material from the previous year for the first couple of weeks during the new school year. To compact this issue many schools have started assigning summer projects, that helps students retain some of valuable information and make the transiton back to school easier. Most summer projects are teacher- designed , which mean that teacher come up with the concept of the project and have set expectations for that project. Althought some may believe otherwise my experience, the experience of friends, and the experience of classmates helps prove that summer projects should be student-desighned.

Based on my personal experience, summer projects should be student-designed. Last year I was assigned to write an essay based on shadowing experience of a career of your chosing. This was a student-designed project because students got the option to write about whatever particular career fasinated them. At first it was dificult to decide what career I wanted to chose, but in the end I ended up shadowing at a veterinary clinic. This was one of the best decisions I made, because it not only helped show me a potential career I might want to pursue, but also a major I might want to study in college. If this project was teacher designed and I was forced to write about a partiular subect I had no intrest in, then I might have never found out about my passion for helping for animals. While some may argue that teacher-designed project are more useful for the subject course, my student- designed project was more important because it helped me discover some new intrest, and it is important that schools help students discover what intrest them.

The experience of my friends Generic_Name and Generic_Name help prove that summer projects should be student-designed. Generic_Name summer project require her to complete a question and answer packet based on the first four chapters of the text book. Generic_Name project was to come up with a unique way of presenting the first four chapter to the class, so that they better understood the material. In the end, Generic_Name waited untill the last three days of summer to complet her packet, and ended up not full understanding the concept of the textbook. On the other hand, Generic_Names project required more work and time, which ment that she needed to not only start sooner, but also come up with a schedual that allowed her to finish before the project was due. This project helped Generic_Name develope better time management skills, and she ended up better understanding the concept as well. Some may arugue that the amount of work and time ashely spent on the project verses Generic_Name simple packet that didnt take as much time or effort wasnt as vauluable, but Generic_Name grades ended up suffered the first quarter due to her poor understanding of the material, and poor time mangement skills.

My classmate Generic_Name helps show the importance of student-directed projects. Generic_Names summer assignment was to present a worldly issue that impacts a country of his chosing to the class. This was a student-directed project because Generic_Name got to decide how he was not only going to direct the project, but what topic and country he would do. At first Generic_Name found this tasks quite dificult, and decided to gather a few of his friends to help eachother with the project. Generic_Name and his friends decided to do the same worldly impact but for diffrent counties. Without the colaboration of him and his friends, Generic_Name wouldn't have been able to excute the project as well as he did. Working together is always better than working alone, because it allows for people to show diffrent perspectives that you alone might not have taught of. Generic_Name also stated ""if it was not for the help of my group I would have give up on the project' which helps show the importance of a support system. Although some may want to state that a teacher-directed projects are more insightful, working together increases a student responsibility skill and willingness to do the project because they have a duty to your group to finish the project.",5,Summer projects,Independent
E0FEF743B354,"Some schools assign projects to students for their summer so that they continue learning over break. These projects should be designed by the students because they would make it easier than their teacher would, they would make it more interesting for themselves, and they would be able to complete more projects faster.

The first reason students should design their summer projects is because they would make the project easier for themselves than their teacher would. Some may think that easier projects are bad but thats not the case, if the projects were easier for them then they would be more likely to complete it. The students wouldnt want to make a project thats hard for them to complete so they would make it easy while still making a good project. This is fair because they already have to do projects on there summer break so they might as well be easy.

The second reason students should design their own projects is because they would make the project more interesting for themselves if they were to design it. Students know what they are interested in; therefore, each project would be personalized. This is good because everyone's interests are different. If the students designed their projects with their own interests in mind they would also be more inclined to complete the project since it relates to them and its about what makes them happy.

The third and last reason that students should design their own summer projects is because if they did so, they would be able to complete more projects at a faster rate. If the student designed his or her own project, they would make it easier to complete for themselves and they would find it more interesting in turn being able to finish a project faster than if their teacher were to make it. If a student finished their projects faster than they could fit do more projects and learn more over summer; also, if they were to complete more projects over summer, they could do multiple different projects over multiple different topics therefore they would be able remembering more of what they learned the past year.

In conclusion, it would be better for students and their education if they were to design and create their own school summer projects. This would be better because the students would make them easier for themselves, they would make them more based off of their own interests, and they would be able to complete more projects over the span of their break. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
4B9F8C01BFA1,"Summer projects are usually used to keep students engaged in the learning mindset while being out of school for a long period of time(Summer). It is a way for teachers and schools to remind students what they are expected to come to grips with, once the summer comes to an end. Students often times dread the idea of a summer assignment, but then find it to have been beneficial in the long run. It is only right that these summer projects are teacher-designed, because of how knowledgeable teachers are about the curriculum, what is expected to be learned in the upcoming school year, and what could happen if summer projects were student-based.

Firstly, teachers have already been taught the subject they are teaching, years before new students are coming into class to learn it. The variety of struggles and questions that students ask are usually very common and become consistent as the years go by. Teachers pick up on these things and automatically frame the school year around those struggles as well as ones that are shown among the new class. For example, as a student there are times where a question needs to be asked to the teacher. In a typical scenario the teacher will answer and the student will trust them with the answer they give them. This same trust should be used when given these summer assignments as teachers are more knowledgeable than a typical student is.

Secondly, to elaborate, many students have heard teachers say something along the lines of, ""We will have a test on this when everyone gets back,"" or ""This stuff will be very important for the upcoming year."" Teachers say these things because they know what they have to teach students and know what is to be learned by the end of the year. It is best to keep students engaged in the subject while creating a headstart of the quarter. There is an entire outline of what is supposed to be taught to students by each quarterly deadline as well as the school year deadline. Everything is laid out in the best way possible and for more experienced teachers, have been used for years. With that being the case, what is usually confused by students and what is crucial to know, is already known by teachers before the year starts.

Lastly, if projects in the summer were just student-designed, the whole idea of a summer assignment wouldn't be as productive. Students would still do the assignment, but they would design the project to be more beneficial to them. For example, everyone has studied one time in their life, and know how much effort has to go into it in order to get a great grade on a test. What students now tend to do, is only study the things that they feel most comfortable in. This is a way to feel content and confident in the subject because of the known portion in that unit. With this inquiry being the case, it is only reasonable to say that there will be a similar outcome if summer projects were student- designed. Instead of doing something new, they will make the project based on something that is already known.

To conclude, summer projects should be teacher-designed because of what the entire purpose of what a summer assignment is suppose to accomplish. Schools should have teacher-based summer projects because of the knowledge teachers consist of about the curriculum, what they already expect to be learned in the upcoming school year, and what is most likely to happen if student projects were student-based.",5,Summer projects,Independent
A76DEAA44D9C,"Projects is like supreme pizza. Each project consists of many details and ideas, which combines as one big main idea. Not all projects are boring though; coloring and drawing plays a huge role in how the project is represented. My science fair project involved bright colorful headings with colored pictures on a poster board displaying how gravity affects light fragile objects. Summer projects should be student-designed because it requires students to challenge themselves, it allows students to be creative, and it helps teachers receive feedback.

One reason summer projects should be student-designed is because it pushes students to face a big challenge. For instance, last year my English teacher assigned a project to complete based on the book

Animal Farm by George Orwell. She explained we needed to design the format and organization of the main idea without going off topic. I struggled to think of a theme for my own for days. After planning for a while, I decided to illustrate pigs on their hind legs with ribbons, a horse, a sheep, a cow, and several guard dogs for the pigs. This project required me to think outside the box and was the most difficult one I was assigned.

Another reason students should design summer projects is because it allows students to be creative. For example, my Spanish teacher always assigns chapter projects, and the most recent I did was about the train station. I was allowed to make the project in anyway as long as I used the right grammar and all of the vocabulary stated in the chapter. First, I wrote a dialogue between an employee and customer with a variety of colored pens. Next, I illustrated small pictures for the vocabulary. Then, I glued the dialogue and pictures onto light yellow construction paper. Lastly, I designed the title with bubble letters and a blue colored pencil.

In addition, summer projects should be designed by students because it helps teachers analyze the students idea and theme of the project. For instance, I was given a project on trade routes in my advanced placement history class. My teacher addressed me to design the project in anyway about one out three trade routes. I chose the Trans-Saharan trade route and made a pamphlet that tourists would use to travel. I explained what food was there, what the climate was like, what they mainly traded, what was most interesting about the Trans-Saharan, what transportation thats provided, and what to avoid while traveling there. Once she graded my project she had a meeting with me about the way I expressed the trade route. She told me the idea was extremely creative and the information I used was excellent. However, she said the pamphlet would be more neat if I organized it and added pictures for examples.

Some students argue teacher-designed projects are more of a learning experience. However, student-designed projects teaches students how to be independent and responsible. For example, this year I was assigned a project on

Julius Caesar , and I was to compare two different characters by using my own theme. I came up with three different sections for the project on my own without help; I made two slogans and wrote one speech in the positive character's point of view. I had a week to complete the project and present it in class. The deadline and the whole project taught me how to manage my time more consistently, it taught me how to work alone, and it taught me how to be responsible for my own grades.

Moreover, summer projects should be student-designed to help students have a more knowledgeable education. I propose students write a letter to their principle about why students should design their own summer projects. As a student I would like to receive the best education so I am more likely to succeed in the near future. Designing my own summer project helps keep my mind fresh and helps me grow more wise as a person. Having to face a challenge myself, to be able to be creative, and to help my teachers receive feedback are reasons summer projects need to be designed by students. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
614FF07AA1FC,"In school these days, summer projects are assigned in order to keep work ethic up, but, they should be student designed. There is an ongoing debate on whether summer projects should be student or teacher designed. Those who disagree with student designed summer projects say that teachers will make more rigorous projects and since they are teachers they know best; however, this is wrong. Student designed projects are best because they are more creative, will use new technology, and in the end students are the ones completing the projects.

There are a multitude of reasons why students should be able to design their own projects; such as, they have to do the project. Since students will be the ones even doing summer projects, they will design something with their capabilities. Unlike teachers, who may disregard ability and force students to do something extravagant and time consuming, students know what they can and can not do, allowing for projects that do not cause too much stress. Student designed projects will also generally be more enjoyable. Completing a project that one designed them self is far more rewarding than doing the same boring project. Along with this, projects can be tailored more to them. Many teacher projects are a one size fits all and don't take into account different schedules and interests. Students can design projects with their schedule so they are cramming to do it, and can be inspired by their own interests so they are more inclined to do it. On top of all of this, students designed projects will just be easier. Summer break is a vacation and many student will not want to be thinking or doing an enormous project, so summer projects should be easier than school year projects. Teachers would not take this factor into account and stress their students out when they are supposed to be relaxing.

Some other reasons that students should be able to design their own projects are that students can come up with new ideas that are modern. For instance, students know how to utilize new technology and can use it to help them develop projects that are new. Technology can also be more accessible if students are on vacation, so they can work on it from anywhere. Teachers tend to neglect this, and reuse the same project from years ago that do not acknowledge the new capabilities technology has, this makes projects outdated and boring. Student designed projects will also be more creative. Teachers make projects nigh a hundred times, they will use the same method yielding the same kind of structure. Fresh ideas will avoid the drag of doing something that students have done also nigh a hundred times, making projects more compelling. New ideas to the table will as well add variance. It is almost with certainly that teachers get bored grading the same project year after year, well, students can prevent that with new, creative projects. Another reason is that designing a project help builds life skills needed for the work force. Making a project rubric and guidelines are not easy, it will require coming up with a solution. Decisions can be hard to make, giving students a chance to experience something they will as an adult. Taking charge and maintaining the energy through out the project is also good for building experience. Even if a student does not want to do a project, they still have to be able to power through it, which is a feeling most people with jobs feel.

Student designed projects for the summer are better than teacher designed projects for many reasons. They are better because students can be more creative, they know their capabilities more, and can utilize new technology. Those will disagree say that teacher designed summer projects are better because they will create harder, more rigorous projects and they know best as teachers, but this is just simply not true. This is important topic because every summer students are subjected to projects with no student input, and this should change.",5,Summer projects,Independent
A932B6A489DE,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects over break to assure they continue to learn during break. These summer projects should be student designed because the project will give students a chance to explore their desires, enhance creativity, and to learn responsibility. However, if the assignment was designed by the teacher the project could be sculpted to fit the students needs and strengthen areas of weakness.

To begin, student designed projects gives the opportunity to explore their desires. These projects can help with finding a career that suits them or with finding out ways to enjoy certain activities. For example, when I had science fair I had to come up with my own project. At first the whole situation was scary and i didnt know how or what i was going to do so, i waited till suddenly i had and amazing idea about researching certain buildings and how they were built. Many of the structures I saw on my laptop screen were mesmerizing. This incredible idea led to me eventually led to me studying researching to become an architect. For Example, currently i am taking culinary arts as one of my classes at Patrick Henry High School. In the beginning i was not sure if i had any skills related to this trade but, after being in the class for a week my instructor told me that i should strive to work towards becoming a chef. So I took his advice an now i have found something that truly interest me.

Secondly, student designed projects can enhance creativity. Student designed projects can enhance creativity by making one think outside the box. For example, in my neighborhood my friend lives a couple doors down from me. He came to me asking for help with finding a way to make his idea for a way to make his cat energetic. We came up with a variety of ideas but many of them failed. After almost all of our ideas were trashed for failing we had to think outside the norm. As we were thinking a great idea came to my friend and the idea actually was the solution we needed the whole time.

Thirdly, student designed projects can teach someone to be responsible. When someone has to come up with an idea on their own, they have to be able to manage time and be able to execute their plan. When doing the project by your self you learn to acquire a sense of responsibility. Being more responsible can be useful because it will follow you throughout your whole life. For example, when I did science fair i slacked off almost all of my time and wasnt being responsible. Since I wasnt being responsible I could have gotten a bad grade in my science class and humiliated myself in front of everyone.

In conclusion, student designed projects have many benefits that can help them succeed in life and improve oneself. These benefits can help at work, school, and in everyday situations. Do you believe that projects should be student designed or teacher designed?",5,Summer projects,Independent
68C31A543A83,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects, so the students continue to learn during their break. Critics might say that these summer projects should be designed by students because they understand what the students will be doing during summer break. These summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers know what the students will be learning after their summer break is over, teachers have more knowledge than students, and students will make the project as easy as possible.

Teachers should be designing these summer projects because they know what the students will be learning after summer break. This will be more beneficial for the students because the teacher can design the project that mainly focuses on material that will be crucial for the students when summer break ends. For example, if a student needs to know the fundamentals of Algebra 1, the teacher can add Algebra 1 basics onto the project that way after the break, the students know the material and the teacher will not have to spend a lot of class time reviewing. This not only helps the students, but also helps the teachers too since they can spend more time on new material rather than reviewing old material. The teacher could also include problems from next years course to give the students a little taste of what is to come.

The next reason as to why the summer projects should be designed by teachers is because the teachers have more knowledge than the students. The teachers having more knowledge about their subject and life in general is super helpful for the students when it comes to designing the project. If a student were to design the project it could possibly be a huge mess compared to if a teacher designed it because the teacher has done many projects before they became a teacher. This is very important because the teacher knows what kinds of projects are successful and which ones are a complete mess. The teacher can design it so it is easy to read and easy to do for the student.

Lastly, it would be better for a teacher to design the project because the students would try to make it as easy as possible. Since students want to have as little work as possible during their break, they will try to make the project very easy to do; however, if a teacher were to make the project they would make sure that it is not too easy, but also not too hard for the student. This is important because if it was too easy the student would not learn much over the break. For example, a student who got a student-designed project that was super easy might struggle when they come back from break because they did not learn anything since it was too easy. However, a student that got a teacher-designed project that was a bit challenging would have a much easier time when they come back from break compared to the one that got the easy student-designed project.

In conclusion, a teacher-designed project is more beneficial than a student designed project because teachers know what the students will be learning after their summer break ends, teachers have more knowledge than students, and students will try to make the project as easy as possible.",4,Summer projects,Independent
AA9CF617C348,"Do you think if Students designed their own projects they would benefit from them? Would they even do them? How would credited? How would it enhance the students learning more efficiently than a teacher would?

Teacher designed projects are a lot more efficient to student learning because students' maturity levels may not allow them to fully take advantage of the designed projects, the teachers have the degree experience to assign proper projects to enhance the students' learning, and also future consequences for a students' education is important.

Students are often not the most mature people and are big procrastinators. Students are not mature enough to do or even make projects for themselves. There would be no correct balance or challenge because all students like to find easier ways to avoid hard tasks. So having students make the designed projects over the summer would not increase their learning.

Considering experience; Teachers not only have degree, but teaching and assigning a proper designed assignment for to a student to complete is what they work and get paid to do. Teachers have the mind set and the capability to help students achieve and expand their knowledge so that they are progressing. Teachers also always knows what is best for a students' learning and what they should and should not be doing.

When students are assigned an a assignment they might procrastinate but they often realize that laziness and not enhancing your learning to better yourself can affect you in the future. Their decisions can put them at a disadvantage to get into colleges. So having a teacher who designs the projects will help the students progress on their learning for the future because future consequences count. Jobs or even universities would not take a student seriously if their projects were designed by themselves. Teacher designed projects fit curriculum standards that are credible to the learning process of a student, and thats what matters.

In regards, every student should have the opportunity to learn the right way. Learning student to student is not the right way. Teachers design projects because they know students are not mature enough to do it themselves, or have the experience that they have, or even realize how important their future is. Thats why there is not only school but also tutors and extra help offered at every county to better students in their learning. As said before it's not that students aren't capable of designing their own projects but, Teachers are put into place to better the learning of students.",4,Summer projects,Independent
2A6941A106EB,"Summer vacation is a magical time of the year for students all over the world; Without it, students would not be able to function in school throughout the year. Students and Teacher need summer vacation to rest and be able to spend time with family and friends. It is yet still very important for students to continue learning in order to ensure their successes for the fallowing school year. Learning during the summer will cause many students to be successful in school; As long as they are learning by project that the designed to help themselves. The projects that students have to complete during the summer should be student-designed because it allows for students to improve their creativity skills, it causes them less stress during the summer, and it ensures that they are learning about what they need.

In this century, students do not have many chances to improve their creative abilities. Almost all students in America can choose their courses from middle school to college; by having the power to choose classes, they might only take classes to benefit their knowledge, yet it does not help their creativity. Today, teenagers are more interested in becoming a lawyer, doctor, or a business owner; which they do not realize also requires creativity. Becoming a doctor is a dream for many people of all ages, even though it is a long process that takes a lot of knowledge and hard work; the ability to be creative and work around the problem is very vital for this job. If teachers design the projects that the students have to complete during the summer, it will limit and weaken the creativity skills of students. It is known that every skill needs practice to so there can be improvement, without practice the skill might disappear. In order to be successful in life, people need variety of skills. If a person does not have any skills, they will find that it is very hard to find a job and they might find it hard to be successful in school. Learning may be a very stressful task for some children, teens, and even adults: The projects that need to be completed in the summer should be student-designed project, in order to reduce stress on the students doing them.

It is obvious that every person in this world faces stress; stress is an emotion that can cause many conflicts in one's life. Student's can easily have stress, possibly due to their school, home, or work environment. The stress students face can greatly impact their mental health in a bad manner; therefore it is very important for schools to try to create a stress-free environment to help students. To help reduce the stress on students, the school should allow them to design their summer projects themselves, so they are able to complete tasks based on their ability and without difficulties to maximize their successes. At the pediatrics office, teens and young adults are asked about their stress level; which showcases the importance of having low to no stress in their lives. Stress can lead to many mental health problems, which can create physical health problems; therefore it is vital that schools do what they can to reduce the stress they put on students. Allowing the projects to be student-designed will help decrease the amount of stress the students have during the summer, so students can better enjoy their vacation and as well work at their own pace to complete what needs to be completed. Student-designed projects will as well help students learn about topics that they lack knowledge on or topics they need to improve on.

Clearly, there is always room for improvement; Whether it is on a specific topic or a special skill, there is always something new one can learn. In school, teachers cover many topics with their students to verify that their students have knowledge on what they are tested on. Teachers may not completely know what their students do not understand, because many students study very hard for a test, yet not understand the material completely. If a student has an upcoming math test that they do not understand, they are likely to memorize their notes to achieve a good grade without fully understanding the topic. If the students could design their summer projects themselves, than they can relearn and having a better understanding of topics that they do not understand. The students can be more successful in their studies if given the chance to earn knowledge about what they need. It may be true that teacher-designed projects can be more effective in teaching students a specific subject or topic, but teacher-designed projects can be too hard, they can cause stress, and they may further confuse students. Teacher-designed projects can be very complex, therefore students may have a very difficult time trying to understand the project especially during the summer, where they are distracted. As well, the projects given by the teacher can confuse the students about the topic because the students lack of understanding, causing them an increase in their stress level.

Conclusively, the summer projects given to students should be student-designed. The students having the ability to design their summer projects will improve their creativity, reduce their stress, and most importantly ensure that the students are learning about the subjects that they need. The education system in America is known as the best education system in the world; yet it causes many students stress and causes them to be lose some skills by learning new ones. Allowing summer projects to be student-design will be a step in the correct direction to better the education system. It is important to reform the system and try to make it perfect, so the upcoming generations can have the best education possible and a better future. Students, parents, teachers, and even the common man can petition to better the system: By petitioning, people can create a brighter future for themselves, their children, grandchildren, and even their country as a whole. ",6,Summer projects,Independent
B796909E583C,"Students go into the summer break each year without any assignments to assure that students are still learning because students do not agree with the idea of having assignments during their summer break. However, assigning summer projects for students is a better idea than assigning summer projects to teachers. Although some may believe summer projects should be teacher-designed because it helps teachers become better at teaching, summer projects should be student-designed because it helps students better understand what they are learning, have a fresh memory, and mature better.

To begin with, summer projects for students can help them better understand what is taught throughout the year. Students having projects over the summer can help them have more time to study what they do not understand. Students having the benefit to study over the summer can help them improve on tests, classwork, homework, and other assignments. Some students have other classes and do not have the time to study for each individual class, so assigning summer projects can benefit students to having more time to study and understand what they do not know. Also, if teachers assign enjoyable summer projects for students to complete, students will be more enthusiastic to put effort into the assignment and have a better mindset into understanding topics. Students should have summer projects to complete because it helps them have a better understanding of what they have learned.

In addition, summer projects for students can benefit them in remembering what they have learned. Students go to school and forget what they have learned last year or even at the beginning of the school year. The majority of students struggle to remember everything they learn in each class because students have multiple classes they have to remember different topics in. Also, some students tend to take tests and/or quizzes and not become comfortable with the grade they have scored because students get nervous during the test/quiz and forget what they have learned. Therefore, assigning summer projects for students will benefit students into being more organized and always having a fresh mindset of what they have learned.

Furthermore, teachers should assign summer projects for students to complete because it helps students mature better. Students already have a big responsibility going to school everyday and receiving homework, classwork, and tests and quizzes, but having an assignment over the summer is a bigger responsibility. Having assignments over the summer is a big responsibility because students are taking up their personal time to complete an assignment over their summer break. Students that are able to complete a summer project shows that they have responsibility and maturity. To conclude, teachers should assign students summer projects because it helps them grow maturity and take responsibility for things students should be doing.

In conclusion, teachers should assign students to summer projects because it helps students better understand what they are learning, have a fresh memory, and mature better. The worst outcome that could happen into students having summer projects to complete, is students forgetting about the summer project they were assigned to and not complete it. The positive outcome to students having summer projects to complete, is having a better school year the following year.

A1E09E155EF6,"After two tiring semesters of school, summer allows for students and teachers to finally take a break. Though this break is crucial to a students' success in the following year, it allows for them to lose vital information learned that school year. Through different assignments, such as projects, schools have found creative ways to combat this information lost, enabling students to retain and possibly learn new things during the duration of the summer. It is crucial, though, that these projects are teacher-designed. Teacher-designed projects will not only allow for the students to learn correct information, but they will also hold the students accountable for their work and enable a consistency in knowledge amongst the students' return.

Through teacher-designed projects, students will learn the correct information. With set rubrics and key points the students have to achieve, they are set on a clear, uninterrupted path to finishing their projects with precision and accuracy, aiding them in their retaining and learning of the correct information. Though many students are capable in designing their own projects, teacher-designed projects will simply enforce and guaranteed that the information learned and researched about is correct.

Teacher-designed projects will hold students accountable in their finishing by the deadline. By simply subtracting the component of the creation of the project idea, students are left with one less immense task in their finishing of their projects, aiding them in their immediate commencement. By making these projects teacher-designed, there will be no excuses, and or confusion, which will help in the students' completion of their summer projects on time. As opposed to a student-designed project, many students could be misled through not knowing and confused on what to do for a project, thereby leading many to be unable to reach the end-of-summer deadline.

By requiring the students to complete a teacher-designed project, there will be a consistency in learning among them. Having a set topic, given by a teacher, to all of the students will allow for the equality and consistency in knowledge once they return to school from summer. Unlike teacher-designed projects, student-designed projects will lead the students many different ways, creating an imbalance in knowledge between each and every student. This will make it very difficult for teachers to plan their classes for the year due to the unknowing in what a student revised and retained during the summer.

In all, teacher-designed projects are significantly more effective and sufficient than student-designed projects. Teacher-designed projects will not only aid in a students' learning of accurate information, but will allow for the students to be equal in their knowledge in a certain area of study. Projects designed by teachers will also aid in a students' accountability of their work, leaving them with set, coherent guidelines and topics to follow. By the use of projects, designed by teachers, during the summer it will allow for a more effective and efficient school year. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
92017C74CF22,"Should summer projects be teacher or student designed? Students should have full access to make their own summer packets. Who else knows what kids struggle with in school than the students their selves. They should have the right to make their own summer packet because they will make it fun for them, they know what they need help in the most, and it will be much easier on the teachers.

Firstly, letting students be in charge of making their summer packets will be the best thing ever. Students will loose interest in a summer packet if its just work page after page. For example, I once had a teacher that was very boring, her name was Generic_Name. Kids will do everything in their power to get out of her class, but they always failed to do so. Generic_Name would make the thickest packets ever, filled with reading passages that didn't have questions. When you returned to school after the summer, she'll give you a big exam on them. Of course students always failed because they didn't want to read them.

If a student was put in charge, they will add fun and creative things in the packet, which would keep the students attention. This way the students would keep their eyes on the packet to complete it.

Secondly, most of the time teachers often tend to put what they want to put in a packet, rather than what the students need. Putting students in charge will be perfect because they know their strengths and weaknesses. Lets say a student is struggling in Scientific Notation, giving a student packets on fractions and multiplication isn't going to help them on what they really need help on. Students sometimes feel overwhelmed when teachers put a lot of work on them. Students being in charge of making their summer packets will be more calm and stable.

Thirdly, giving students the honor of conducting their own summer packets will be more time consuming. Teachers always complain on how they never have time to do certain things. This will be time to take a break and have less to worry about. Most of the time teachers will give you work on a lot of materials you have already mastered and none of what you are struggling on. Giving students authority over summer packets will be like giving Kobe Bryant a basketball. It will bw a easy score. Students know their working limits, for they can only work so much before loosing focus on a certain subject.

Many people will disagree with this idea because they think kids are immature and can't handle it. Teachers love to be in control over everything. However thats not the case, many kids are very bright and intelligent. I've seen kids handle way more than the average teacher and it's quite eye catching. Students know what they need and how to catch their attention.

In Conclusion, students should be allowed to design their own summer packet. In fact, they chances of them completing something the are interested in are extremely high. Students should have full access to make their own summer packet because they will make it fun for them, they know what they need help in the most, and it will be much easier on the teachers.",5,Summer projects,Independent
10BE8DD83F81,"Summer is the season where students like to have nothing but fun and relaxation. During this time, expanding your learning capability in subjects like reading, science, history, and math is never a bad thing. Some schools in the United States are now requiring that students complete summer projects during the break to ensure that students are not getting far behind. But this raises the question of if students should design their program, or if the teachers should design the program. Teachers should design any and all programs designated for students because students are not always trustworthy, teachers have better insight in knowing what each student needs to achieve, and if a student chooses, whose to say they have not picked something they have already completed prior to summer.

One factor in why teachers should design the program is that students are not always trustworthy. When teachers designate programs in the summer, they set up programs that are for educational purposes. To most students ""educational learning"" is playing Fortnite all day until they win a battle. Or calculating how many miles it takes them to drive from work, home, a party, and back. For example, a young man by the name of ""Generic_Name"" was well known in the Generic_School community. He was a football, basketball, and lacrosse player who was class president the first three years in high school. As president, one of his major duties were to plan the student summer program, and he knew that the summer program was meant to be educational. The teacher sponsor of class council decided to show up at one of the program meetings one summer day before senior year, and to his surprise, he found out that Generic_Name ""summer program"" was a summer long improve tournament.

What some students fail to understand, is that teachers know exactly what they are doing and what each student needs to achieve. As everyone knows, not all students are the same. Whether that is in the way they learn, look, speak, or comprehend. Another student that was popular in the Generic_School district named ""Generic_Name"", was always strong in most subjects except science. So during his time at his summer program, the teachers always gave him science stuff to work on, while also adding his strongest studies here and there. Generic_Name friend Generic_Name was a strange case. Generic_Name was smarter than Generic_Name by a landslide, and that is saying a lot being that Generic_Name was a genius. Generic_Name pretty much passed any test you threw his way, but Generic_Name, his AP Spanish teacher, felt that he could be better in Spanish, even though he finished with a ""B"". He had to give up his swimming camp with Michael Phelps, just to spend the summer practicing Spanish with Generic_Name. As a result, he got a perfect score on his AP test, and came to college with six credits just from that class.

Being a kid, you are born into a terrible skill of being sneaky and sometimes getting away with it. If students were able to design programs during the summer, how could it be known that it is not a program they have already completed? Generic_Name was the first third and fourth grader to complete all 12 multiplication tables in under a minute at Woodbrook Elementary School. Because of this, he needed to do something different for his summer program, but because he was able to choose what students had to do, he completed the same 12 multiplication tables year after year. He even had the nerve to put on his college application that he has been in charge of and participated in math camp for nine years. And of course, the Business school of Generic_School accepted him.

Now what is not always true is that every kid are not capable of designing their own summer program. In fact, there is a great amount that would not only help themselves, but also help others in excelling in their learning capabilities. But facts are the facts, not every child can be trusted. And what hassle is it to have a teacher be in charge of designing when they already get paid to teach? Some people will not understand, while others will, but in reality, the help from an adult can go a long way!",6,Summer projects,Independent
D7D66E258830,"Summer projects have been a task asked of students since the beginning of school. There is an ongoing debate about whether summer projects should be issued by teachers or if students should be the ones to design the project. Those who oppose this state that students designing the project would make it easier and more fun but this is not the case. Although some may disagree, projects issued out by teachers would be very beneficial.

Summer projects designed by teachers will erase a huge struggle in students summer projects. Since students already know the topic it will be easier to complete. Meaning students will be able to complete the projects in less time with better results. Students have been learning the curriculum the whole year and teachers will base the project off of the same curriculum. Students will also have a clear rubric to follow for the project. This will make it less stressful for students since teachers will include a rubric on what has to be on the project. Since all of the projects will be the same students can work together. This is beneficial so students can complete the task faster and revise with their peers, leading to students having overall better projects and better grades.

In addition, teacher designed projects will help students in the upcoming year. Teachers will be using the same curriculum. This ensures that students are learning things that will benefit them in the future. Instead of just being busy work to ruin their summers. Teacher designed projects will be helpful for the next year as well. Since the student will be doing this project during the summer they will retain the information for the next school year. Teacher created projects will also give students a head start in the class. Since students will already know the basics of what they will be learning. Resulting in less students being behind and more time to focus on learning.

Although some may disagree, projects issued out by teachers would be very beneficial. This is the case due to projects being helpful for the next year, learning the correct curriculum, and giving you a head start in the class. Those who oppose this state students will be more obligated to complete a task they designed and students will have more fun if they created it, but this is not true. Teacher created prompts will be very helpful in aiding students during gruesome summer projects.",4,Summer projects,Independent
C46CDD7E69A4,"In High School, many classes have summer projects, although mostly science classes. These projects, since the dawn of time, have been created by teachers to keep the project focused on exactly what the teacher wants, and to ensure the assignment is a rigorous and difficult experience. While teacher-designed projects have been the primary way for a long time, student-designed projects are a much more engaging and enriching experience for students to experience.

The actual designing of said project can be an enriching process for the students. When students are allotted time at the end of the previous year to create it, there is an opportunity for teachers to review the project. The primary issue with student-base projects over the summer is the ideology that students may not hold themselves to the standards teachers traditionally would. This time before summer starts would allow teachers to see what students want to do, and guide them towards the standards expected by the teaching, but in a way in which the student can hold the assignment at their skill level. In the current system, students may be handed an assignment to do over the summer that is not at their level of education, but the student-created projects give students an opportunity to create something they know will be challenging. With these projects tailored to the student's learning level requirements, and meeting teacher expectations, students know what to expect in their project. Nothing is a surprise, making goals very simple to set. Students could set a reasonable, obtainable, calender that would bring them to where the teacher wants by the end of the summer. This whole process of making an engaging and educating assignment will likely be a new experience for many students. It has long since been believed by human that 'the best way to learn something is to teach it'. Being both the teacher and the student in these projects gives students the opportunity to learn more than they ever could from a traditional teacher-designed project.

A few years ago, summer projects were banned from Generic_City. Parents were complaining about too much work over the summer. This was most likely caused by the project not fitting them, an issue with the system of teacher-designed projects. Under the concept of student-created projects, students could design their project to be feasible within their busy summer schedules. If a student is going to the beach, and they need a project for biology, they could keep a log of all animals and signs of animals on the beach, with pictures, and explain the significance. Under the previous system, they may have been expected to go into the woods and do something similar, which would not be possible to accommodate under their schedule. Other classes, like math, may expect students to complete a giant packet covering all material. Because this is an impersonal packet designed to challenge everyone, some students may whiz through large portions of the packet, or get bored on the simple, more tedious, math. Other students may find parts of the packet beyond their skill, or find themselves in need of someone to ask for help, who may not be readily available. If students were to design their own packet, they could focus it on areas they know to struggle in, and pick the skill level required for each problem. Students who bore easily could create fantastical problems that engage the student to want to find the answer.

During the freshman year of high school, the school attempted to utilize a system called personalized learning. The idea behind this system was to have assignments tailored to the expectations of teachers and students, and be as engaging for that specific student. It failed spectacularly. Many students skipped significant portions of the day, because teachers didn't create many assignments. Others sat on their phone in class, pretending to work. The problem was the amount of work expected from the teachers. The teacher was expected to know exactly what level each person was at, and to create something unique for each student. That is an unbelievable amount of work to put on a single adult. With the system of student-designed projects, however, students would know their own level. Students would know where they struggle, and where they thrive. Students would know how to create something that meets their expectations, and it would be quite simple for the teacher to confirm that this assignment is up to their standards as well. While asking each student to create an entire year's worth of content would be asking a lot of the student, running into the issues discovered in the personalized learning fiasco, this system would ask them to make one assignment, a much more manageable task.

Teacher designed summer projects is a very simple system, and is asking no more from the teacher than what they are already doing. This system, though, is ineffective, and disliked by students and parents alike due to the inflexible nature, during the time spent away from school schedule. Student designed assignments over the summer would allow students to prepare themselves for the next year, in what they need reviewing of. Not what their classmate needs reviewing of, but what this individual student needs to learn. ",6,Summer projects,Independent
118E2E7C9C73,"I believe that these projects should be teacher designed because it would be easier to understand, there will be a good amount of information needed, and the directions that would be given from the teachers would be put in the right order so the student knows what he/she is doing.

The reason I believe that projects should be teacher designed because it would be easier to understand. Students would rather have a project to do on their own, but still need the assistance or guide for them to know what to do in what way and how to do it. That is why there would be a list of instructions a teacher would give to their student so they can understand what they're doing on the project and how to get the right information. Some students lose most of their knowledge during the summer because they don't go to school over break which is a long period of time. To prevent that from happening, teachers assign work for the students to do over the break.

I also believe that because there will be a good amount of information given from the teacher. If the students don't have a clue of what to do on the project, they will not be able to do the project. Although, if the teacher can give a good amount of information, along with the project, then the student will understand what to do, where to get more information about the subject, and will gain more knowledge over the remaining time during the summer.

Also, I believe that the teachers should give the students a list of directions so they know what to do and in what order, such as a syllabus. If they don't know what they're looking for, then they won't be able to give the right information on the project. The teacher could give the students sources to get their information from, require them to read books on that subject, or assist them and tell them where to get the remaining information from and what to put. They will be lost and won't understand what to do and how to do the project because of the fact that there is no instructions, no syllabus, and no help to be given. So therefore, the students won't be able to do anything on the project because they'd be confused and won't know what to do.

I also happen to disagree that the project shouldn't be student designed because they are doing whatever on the project and don't know what the project is about, there isn't instructions, and they can't request for help.

Students are allowed to let their imagination roam free, especially on a school project, but they need to know what they're dealing with and how to do so. Without instructions to help them, they won't be able to do the project right and it will be even harder for them to do simply because of the fact that there aren't any directions to guide the students and to give them the information they need to complete the project.

And to add on, any school project should come with directions to assist the student and to help him/her so they won't be confused during the completion of the project. If there is no instructions given, then the project will be harder to complete and harder to understand. The students would be confused on what the project is about, how to complete the project, and where to get the best information form. Every student needs a guide or instructions to do homework or projects, but of course they need support on doing so. They will be questioning themselves on what to do and how to do it.

Finally, students can try to ask for help, but everyone else will be just as confused. If there are no instructions and no way of telling how to do the project or what it is about, then getting assistance will be even harder than doing there project. The reason why it will be harder is because the people you ask for help will question themselves on what the project is about, where to get the information, and why there isn't any given instructions on how to do the summer assignment. If the students ask their parent or guardian, they'll either try to help, even though they are just as confused as the student, or they'll question where the directions are and if there isn't any, why?

I believe that these projects should be teacher designed because it would be easier to understand and it would rather help them understand than being confused, there will be a good amount of information needed and they'll know what to do on the project, and the directions that would be given from the teachers would be put in the right order so the student knows what he/she is doing. I also disagree that the project shouldn't be student designed because they are doing whatever on the project and don't know what the project is about which will cause confusion and lead to the project being incomplete, there isn't instructions which will lead to the student not doing any work simply because he/she doesn't know what to do, and they can't request for help because no one else, besides the teacher, knows what the project is about and how to complete it. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
09E2F282EC82,"Teachers have worked endlessly throughout the school year to provide the best assignments they could to their students, so why not give them a break over summer? Some schools require there to be summer projects to continue students' education, even during their break. Throughout the summer, there is plenty of time for students to learn by themselves and create their own project, with help from a teacher if needed. A student-designed summer project is a better option, over a teacher-designed project, because students can base their project around a topic interesting to them; plan it around any personal limitations; and give them a taste on how it is to plan as a teacher.

Students should be able to create their own project on something they're interested in. It's harder for students to maintain focus on a topic they're not as interested in. Student's will tend to do poorly or not turn in work that they do not think will be helpful, so why continue that cycle? Having them create their own project allows them to research a future career or even a topic they deemed interesting. By doing this, students would be more attentive to their project and more likely to complete it with great detail. The Middle Years Program project, found in Generic_School, is a good precedent to follow by. Students were given the liberty to chose the topic they wanted to use in their project and, with some help of teachers, planned their time frame and resources. Students were interested in their topics and weren't as hesitant to do the tasks they needed to do. Some even did more than asked, interviewing people and making online surveys. This student-based project was a great example of letting students think on their own, rather than following a basic assignment given. Students would be more likely to invest themselves in their project with less amount of dread than a normal project given.

Students know their limit as to what they can or can't complete on time. This allows students to base their project around their time frame. It would benefit the student by allowing them to complete their project, even if they're in a different circumstance than most. For example, if a student is traveling to another country, the student has the option to base their project around their environment, resources, and available time. The student would then have a plan and no excuse as to why they didn't complete their project. The Middle Years Program project is a good example to how students can plan around their own events. They had the liberty to use their time in their own manner. This made it so students could have their out of school events and work on their project by managing their time correctly. Students would be able to balance their school work with their personal life even more, if they're given the option to design their own summer project,

Although teachers have many years of wisdom and expertise, allowing students to plan and create a project would force students to think like a teacher. They would create an outline, a time frame, and a final product by themselves. A lot of this work is what a teacher would already have done beforehand. By having students create their own projects, they would get a taste of the whole process, not just the completion section. It would not only be beneficial for students to witness the process, but also beneficial to teachers. Every student would create a different plan which could inspire teachers for their future assignments. Teachers would gain insight on how their students work best and use that information to alter their way of teaching to benefit their students once school is back in session.

Teachers have worked all school year long to provide the best assignments to their students, so why not allow students to create their own? Having a student-designed project would allow students to continue their education and creativity over the summer. Teachers would see their students process and use that to better their own curriculum. Both students and teachers would benefit from student-designed projects. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
F52F99CDFF23,"Students say that summer assignments or projects made by teachers are hard. But, why do teachers give us such hard and lengthy summer projects? Teachers believe that summer assignments will help us retain our knowledge during summer vacation. Students think that it is a waste of time and takes majority of their summer vacation away, but it actually helps them get ready for there upcoming year. I believe that students should come out of their comfort zone and try something new or something that is helpful for their upcoming year. The summer assignments or projects should be designed by teachers because then they're more efficient, challenging, and help you learn.

Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because they're more efficient. By being more efficient, students would be able to do well in their upcoming year. One of my friends was given a project by her teacher, her task was to teach the class, so she was basically the teacher. She had to make a slide of notes for one of the units that she was assigned and present it to the class. The presentation that she was making had to be efficient in order for her classmates to do well on their quiz or test. She was very hesitant and scared to present in front of the class. After she presented, the teacher explained to her how she did; she didn't get a perfect score, but still got a decent grade. My friend could do well on tests or quizzes, but when it comes to do a teachers job it's very difficult. This brings out the fact that teachers have the prior knowledge and the confidence to teach, make tests or quizzes, and summer assignments so they can be more efficient for students.

Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because they're more challenging. Last year, my friend had a summer assignment, she didn't like it and was complaining to me about it. I told her that she should at least try it out and see how it is. She did try it; a couple days later she told me that the assignment was so much fun and was kind of hard but it was a challenge for her. My friend and I are the type of people who love a challenge. To me, summer assignments are seen as a puzzle piece, when given by a teacher. If any assignment is made by a student it's more confusing than easy.

Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because it will help you learn better. Last summer, I got a summer assignment; I looked at the paper and found it a little tricky to do, but I tried my best to finish it. When I started my school year, as a junior, I went to my classes for a whole week, and noticed that in the class where I had my summer assignment, was very easy. All the things that were being taught in class, I already knew because of the summer assignment. This states that the teacher did a good job of making the summer assignment and helping us learn better in class.

Some might say summer assignments or projects by students are better because they are easier to do; however, summer assignments by teachers are the best because they provide more knowledge for the students. Teachers have prior knowledge and know how to teach in a way where students find it best. Teachers want their students to compete with one another to learn and find new ways to understand the material. With a teachers assignment, it would help you learn better and prepare you for what's next. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
