According to the National Safety Council reports cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. 390,000 injuries occurred caused by cell phone use and driving. Nearly 6,000 pedestrians are killed because of this as well. Phones should not be used while driving not only because the dangers that occur but also because the people that are harmed or killed, and it could've been prevented.

It's rare that the driver ever gets hurt. It's always the person they hit or they've caused a lot of damage. Cell phones are a huge distraction while driving a vehicle. Your not paying attention to the road in front of you because something has caught your eye below the dashboard. Something that could've waited until you arrived at your destination. Sometimes you have to ask yourself is it really that important?

2018 an estimate of 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. Cell phone use while driving resulted in 3,000 to 6,000 people getting killed or injured each year. All because someone couldn't leave their phone leave for awhile. Now they have to deal with people's lawyers and insurance company. Just everything that could've been avoided. Creating unnecessary problems for yourself.

May 29, 2019 a new law was created. It prohibits people driving to not use their cell phones. If a person was to disregard this law. The result would be paying a $50 fine for first offense. That's one way to avoid the dangers and consequences of texting and driving. Another one is to make a mental note for yourself, that the text can wait. The message doesn't have to be answered right way. If it's that important pull over.

You shouldn't text and drive or use your cellular device while behind the wheel. Doing so will result in someone being injured or killed, paying a $50 ticket, or even worse. Don't use your phone while di=riving, it can wait.               ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

In today's day and age, technology has drastically increased. People now days seem to rely on their devices more than anything. People surely can't get their eyes off the devices for more than at least a minute. They look at the phone while walking, eating at a dinner table, or even in class while their supposed to be learning. But the main problem that is occurring is people texting on their phone while driving an automobile. This brings up the question if drivers should or shouldn't be able to use their cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

In my perspective, I believe drivers shouldn't be able to use their cellphones while driving. For starters, you're taking your eyes off the road. This is extremely dangerous because it only takes five seconds (minimal amount) of your time taken away from the road for an extreme accident to occur. For example, if u is driving at 55mph while texting or looking at your phone; within them seconds you could have easily got into a car accident with major injuries. This reason is only one reason you shouldn't be able to use your cellphone while driving.

Another reason that you shouldn't be able to use your cellphone while driving is it puts your life at risk and put other innocent lives at risk. When you make the decision to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives of those around you and your life as well. That simple action of ""answering a quick text"" or even glancing at a text means that you are selfishly putting other people's lives in danger. It is one thing to put your own life in danger, but it is unfair and unnecessary to risk the lives of others. These innocent people; young children, friends in your car, pedestrians, and fellow drivers, did absolutely nothing wrong and are forced to have their lives at risk solely due to a poor decision that you made.

The last and final reason is that it's illegal. Regardless of the all the harm caused by texting and driving, it is also illegal in many states. Fines and punishments for texting and driving range greatly depending on the state that you live in; for some states, the fine is merely $20, however, in others, it can be up to $500. And, if the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals, you can actually end up in jail, depending on the severity of the injury. This right here is just the icing on the cake as to why you should stop texting and driving!

In conclusion, people shouldn't be able to operate a cellphone while driving a vehicle because it is very dangerous and also illegal. Taking your eyes off the road for one text can take a life. So please keep your eyes on the road and don't pick up the phone.    ",4,Phones and driving,Independent
E34D7384EE70,"Today, there are many controversial conversations on people using their phones while driving. Some People may think that phones should be allowed to be used for certain reasons such as GPS and other emergency uses while others believe that phones should not be used at all due to accidents and law violations. If people were able to use their phones and be a responsible driver at once, just maybe there would not be a problem with it nowadays.

Even though phones have caused a lot of accidents and deaths, I believe that certain uses of the phones should be allowed while driving. Sometimes, people get emergency phone calls and emergency text that they need to see in order to try and fix the situation if it is a fixable situation. Some people also have their phone for uses of GPS and other informational services. Not all people use their phones as a distraction while driving. Some people just need it at the time.

Even though i believe that using your phone while driving is a good idea, there are many cons to this idea. A lot of car accidents had to do with the involvement of teens and adults using their cellular device. Phones have cause a lot of deaths, not just in America but across the world. I believe there should be more laws made that does not ban phones but put restrictions on them like time restrictions. Example: A law that prevents you from using your phone after 8:00 pm or a law that prevents you from using your phone on certain streets.

All in all, i do believe using your phone while driving is not that bad of an idea as long as people can use it responsible while driving.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

If you have kids in the car and you texting while driving and you do not pay attention to the road and your coming on to a traffic light and it's red a car is in front of you, and then you hit the car you could kill you and your kids just from that one big detraction on the road.

Texting and driving is something common a lot of people do now a day. There are so many problems with cellphone usage while driving. Many people think it's okay to use their phones while driving, but I personally think it is not okay for people to text and drive. Some people rather risk their life's than to be careful about their surrounding and how one car accident can cause so much damage all because that one person wanted to be on their phone. It doesn't just have to be texting it can be in general by just being on your phone. People get way too distracted by cellphone usage.

Cellphones make a big impact on people, who knew that cellphones can be that addicting. It doesn't matter where you are you turn your head and you see someone on their phone because it is so addicting. It almost like having a coffee addiction. When you see people crossing a cross walk you insatiately see a phone in someone's hands and half of the time there not looking at where there going they just walk and walk until they run into somethings. Cellphones are a huge addiction in today's society for everyone including teenagers. You see cellphones almost everywhere you going. You will be shocked about how many people use their phones a day.

When you're driving and you're on your cellphone is really risky. It can cause many problems as in you cashing into someone else or you can go off the road and get in an accident. There have been many different accidents because people want to be on their phone and not focus on the road. Texting and driving can many deaths as well. People die of being in car accidents when the driver is texting. People don't look on the outside of how many tragic thinks can happen in a blink of an eye. It can be life changing too because you never know what can happen or go wrong. Many people don't know how much damage can happen. People die, vision lost, no arm, no leg, an arm, etc. none of this is replaceable but every material thing can be. That's what people don't understand. People need to be careful of their surroundings and, be careful who you have in the car.

People have habits of looking at their phones once they hear a ring. They right away have to go see what it was or who it was. That's where the distraction comes from and that were people get into trouble with officers or car accidents etc. because they get distracted by the ring of a phone. There is always pros and cons about things people being on the phone. Some of the pros are if you have the sound on it is always good for important in the case of an emergency. You always have something on the side or if someone else calls you and it is an emergency. Some of the cons is that people use it for other purposes which is to text, snapchat, twitter, Instagram etc. and they think they can multi task but some people can't. That's why it's better to put the phone down and let social media wait before there is an accident.

It's better to save your life and some else's.

Being safe is one on the most important things. A text message or video call, snapchat, Instagram is not worth you in bad conditions or you causing a death to yourself or to someone else. Phone are becoming to be more addicting by the day and you would be shocked about how much technology has gone up. Keep all eyes on the road never look down and stay focus.

326B272D36A0,"Do you feel that it is safe for someone to have their phone while driving? I believe that that there are reasons why you should and shouldn't be able to have your phone while driving. For example one of the reasons i believe that driving and being on your phone is dangerous is that many accidents can be caused. By that i mean when being on your phone you have no time to pay attention to the road. When driving your attention should be focused on the road at all times when looking down on your phone you can't tell who or what is coming at you, which is a easier way to cause you and or someone else to be injured.

Another reason i believe that it is dangerous for you to be on your phone and driving is because this is now another way to get arrested. By this i mean now if you're riding with your phone in sight the police is liable to arrest you. By doing this you're risking your freedom. Not only are you risking your freedom you're also putting others in harms way. By this i mean what if someone is walking in the cross walk and you happen to be on your phone and accidentally hit someone then not only is that more charges but that's also you injuring an innocent bystander.

There are also good reasons why you should be able to have your phone while driving. For example when going to a place and not knowing the directions your phone has a built in navigation system to help you get there. You don't always have to have your phone in your hand you can buy the stand where your phone can sit on that way you can see both your phone and the road.

So it isn't always bad having your phone while driving.

Another good reason to have your phone while driving is because what if there is an emergency and that is the only way someone can contact you, you don't have to hold your phone you can always get Bluetooth and or wireless headphones. By doing this you are preventing accidents from happening and your also preventing yourself and or anyone else from being in danger. Not only that but you are also able to focus on both the road and the situation that may be happening.

These are the reasons why i believe that having your phone while driving is both a good and bad thing. There are many more reasons why but these are my main three. By stating these i hope that people take caution while using there phones while driving. Now that reasons are listed i hope that people look out for themselves as well as others.

With such an important impact that helps what people do in all fields of work, it is no surprise that people use phones wherever they go. Another important inclusion in a person's everyday life is a car, which is also used by people everyday, though cars have proven to be a lot more dangerous than a phone if a person is not paying attention to the road. Many accidents have happened as a result of people not paying attention to the road and this is exactly where a phone comes into play. As previously mentioned, phones are a part of a person's everyday life, and with that much involvement with a phone it often tends to follow people to them while they are driving their car. When people are on their phone while driving, their chances of getting into an accident greatly increase. Though it may seem harmless at first, operating a phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle is dangerous and should not be allowed.

""Car crashes happen every minute of the day"", according to the National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA). According to Teensafe, ""Distracted driving accounts for approximately is 25% of all motor vehicle crash fatalities...58% being teens."" Ironically, teens use phones more than adults as they are more involved with social media websites and apps. Teens, unlike adults, are also more inexperienced at driving, making the act of them using phones even more dangerous than adults. With all the things that people have to pay attention to on the road, it is almost impossible to do both at the same time.

""Sending or reading a text causes drivers, on average, to take their eyes off the road for five seconds,"" according to Teenlife. Anything can happen in one second when a person's eyes are not on the road, imagine what could happen in five. Whenever a person uses their phone, their chance of being in a crash increases by twenty-three. There are three types of distracted driving and texting fits all three types which is visual, manual, and cognitive. Using a phone causes a person to take their eyes of the road, take their hands off the wheel, and to take their mind off of the road. Because texting can become all three types of distractions, it's arguably the most dangerous action to participate in while driving.

Once again, phones have become a major part of the human life, and as a result, people constantly use their phones. Whether it is to check a text or watch a quick video, it is very dangerous to even attempt this while in a car. Operating a phone or any brand or size should not be allowed while operating a vehicle. Using a phone while not driving is not safe and has proven to be deadly. Hopefully, people will learn not to text and drive and be safer on the road.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Today, the majority of humans in the world own and use cell phones everyday, however no person should be allowed to use their cellular device while operating a vehicle. These vehicles include trucks, sedans, vans, heavy machinery vehicles, bikes, etc. The use of a cellular device while operating a vehicle serves as a major distraction to the driver; even if the driver only looked at the phone just a second could call for a fatal result. Thousands of people die every year due to cell phone use while operating a vehicle, however fatalities, as such, could easily be avoided if drivers would wait until they're no longer driving to check their phones. Texting and driving can be as dangerous as driving intoxicated, driving under the influence, for you reaction time is weakened due to the distraction of your phone. A good reason to not text while driving would be that it takes only a few seconds to park your car, if looking at your phone is that important. With how today's cellphones are made to draw the user in, it is imperative that drivers make the smart decision to just wait to use their phones.

When texting while driving, you are more likely to end up in a wreck rather than going about your day. According to https://www. netsafeutah. org/teens/staysafe/distracted_driving. html , ""Drivers on the phone have worse reaction times than many drunk drivers."" this is important because when you look at your phone while driving is like the equivalent to driving with a blind fold on, and the time it takes the driver to look back at the road from looking at their phone is the same amount of time that it would take to take the ""blindfold"" off. According to https://www. nhtsa. gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving,

""Texting is the most alarming distraction. Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds. At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed."" It only take five seconds of a distraction mistake to result in something that can catastrophically change your life forever, and not in a good way! In all consideration, as a driver, if there is a high need to be on the phone just pull the car over. Although it only takes five seconds of distraction to end in a crash, it takes just a few seconds to pull over safely.

Why risk the consequences of using a phone while driving to begin with? Although the results of using a phone while driving may very, the odds still are not in your favor! As the driver you not only risk your own life, but you also put other lives in your vicinity at risk. According to Jim Forsyth, a Reuters reporter, ""The typical reaction time without texting was between one and two seconds, but while texting it increased to three to four seconds, regardless of whether the driver was typing or reading a text."" (https://www. abc. net. au/science/articles/2011/10/06/3333955. htm). When it comes to driving reacting and timing is everything, but when a driver gets distracted it is almost inevitable for something bad to happen. When driving there is already so much happening on the road, so much that there's not much room for error, that those two seconds of reaction time are key to preventing a car crash. There are so many rules and laws to driving a motor vehicle, however the easiest, of all the rules and laws, is to not text while driving. In fact if a driver always follow this rule, they could be considered a superhero for all the lives they save by not putting others at risk because they did not text and drive.

Is texting and driving at the same time dangerous? One must not have a brain to think there are no risks to texting and driving. Sure, everyone has done it, so why not? Everytime a person texts and drives, they put themselves and others on the road in danger of ending in a car accident or worse death. Don't text and drive, because doing this you will save lives!

While using a phone and driving is common, it can also be very dangerous. That is why people should not be allowed to use their phones while driving. There are other reasons why phone usage should not be permitted while a person is driving.

One of the reasons a person should not be allowed to use their phone while driving is that the risk of getting into a car crash is raised. Those who text and drive are 23% more likely to be in a car crash than those who do not text and drive. In 2016, 3,450 people were killed in distraction-related crashes. Many states ban the use of phones behind the wheel for this reason. If people did not use their phone behind the wheel, the number of deaths and injuries would drop drastically.

The states that prohibit cell phone usage behind the wheel are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia. In Georgia, drivers are not allowed to touch any kind of electronic device with any part of their body. This law has been put into effect because of the more than 1,500 deaths from distracted driving in Georgia in 2016.

People should not be able to use their phones while driving. The use of phones behind the wheel puts many lives at risk. Many states have already banned the use of phones behind the wheel.

Phone use is one of the reasons of car crashes occurring.

Answering a text takes at least 5 seconds of your attention away. That can be enough time for you to collide into another car or a car colliding into you. Even answering a call could take most of your distraction away from you seeing where you are driving. It would be safer to use the cell phone when you come to a complete stop or when you have reached your destination.

Teens are a big percent more likely than adults to get into a car crash or almost crashing into another car or anything that is in your path due to talking or texting on the cell phone.

While using your phone anywhere sounds like a fun idea, it may not be the brightest idea... while driving. Technology is definitely a stepping-stone for all entertainment as a whole. Back then, in a not so distant past, people had to find things that entertained them, like objects around the room. There honestly was not much to do. Then came the commercial distribution of the home television. Eventually, almost every home in the country had at least one television. At that point, people could watch films and shows from the comfort of their home, instead of getting dirty or injured outside. Many years later came the technological advancement of telephones, known more modernly as smartphones. Smartphones were definitely a huge step in technology, because now you can take your entertainment with you. However... it may not have been the best thing.

Obviously, with this sort of convenience, people developed a way to multitask while using their smartphones. However, when something requires your utmost attention, like driving, that would be when you should probably put the phone down. However, using Bluetooth to answer calls is highly acceptable. The main problem at hand is looking at your phone while driving; it is a safety hazard. Now, there are pros, just as there are cons.

Texting while driving is now just as illegal as not wearing your seatbelt in Georgia. That does not mean you cannot use your phone for other things though. Cell phones have many different tools that can help you. Like a compass, or a clock, or especially a GPS. Obviously, you will not need a compass unless you are following a map in your car. The GPS, however, is a perfectly good example as to why using your phone while driving is a good thing. All you do is enter the address/coordinates and you just follow the route, while occasionally checking your screen to see if you are on track. Perfect for multitasking in the car.

Now onto the cons. There are excessively too many cons for you to even consider using your phone while operating a vehicle. The amount of distractions and casualties the problem creates should be more than enough to convince you to put your phone down while driving. Not only are you putting yourself at risk by doing this, but also anyone else who's near you on the road. So many people are injured and/or killed every year because of someone's poor decision to multitask, when their hand should be on the wheel.

To sum it all up, it can be both a blessing and a curse. You benefit from using phones and driving in some ways, but also risk harming others in the process. Texting while driving is not worth more than your well-being. If you are going to bring your phone, at least be smart about it. If not, you might end up like every ""texting while driving"" story; dead or severely injured. Just... think about it.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Should you be permitted to drive a vehicle while using a device? In this case you shouldn't because it comes with many risks while you're on the road. You put yourself in danger while putting other drivers in danger as well. You risk your life with others on the line too!!!!

To begin with it's a big distraction on the road. When you choose to text and drive, you're threatening every single driver around you and placing more value on that text message than yourself and your fellow drivers. You tend to check your phone so much which can cause you to crash with someone else. But also take the focus of your surroundings while driving. It takes your focus away from safe driving. One single text can make a blink of an eye change your life of someone else's life. Also when you're engulfed in a texting conversation, it's easy to forget you're sharing the road with other people. It also takes your hands off the steering wheel to answer one single text.

Another reason that driving while using a device should be allowed is because it is illegal. You get pulled over and get a ticket. But also if caught many times can cause those digits tickets to go up which means big money tickets. It can also rise in auto insurance rates. It can lead up to prison time as well .Is it worth risking your freedom?

More so, is it worth the emotional damage a car accident causes to everyone involved?

Also it leads to getting your license suspended. The consequences you'll face for texting and driving are similar to those you'd get for another one of the most serious driving offenses which is a DUI.

A third reason that using a device while driving shouldn't be allowed is because it can have huge risks. Sending or replying to a text requires that you remove at least one hand from the steering wheel so that you can grip your phone and thumb in a reply. So not only are you multitasking and not focusing your eyes from the road, but you're also trying to deftly use your phone with one hand while at the same time steer your vehicle. So not only do you risk crashing with other vehicles but also losing the steering wheel which is the control of driving the vehicle.

Being able to use a device while operating a vehicle shouldn't be allowed. It brings too many risks and changes to the environment of driving. There would be a lot of accidents on the highway due to having access to a device while driving. Would you want a family member or friend to be on the road with someone so oblivious to the traffic around them? Remember, every time you get behind the wheel, you're entering a shared experience with mothers, fathers, friends, and children. It is every driver's responsibility to always be careful and attentive, ensuring everyone can safely get from Point A to Point B. Which is why driving with a device on your hand shouldn't be allowed.                  ",5,Phones and driving,Independent
AC71A062B952,"Today, majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. There is a new law called ""hands free"" where people that own a cell phone cannot operate it while driving. This has effected people that own motor vehicles in many ways. People need their phones to direct their self's places or answer emergency texts or calls.

The new ""hands free"" law is a law where no one can hold their phone while driving. This has effected people with older cars and even newer cars to this day. As this law is in set, people have to connect their phone to Bluetooth to be able to talk on the phone. For example, if you're driving and someone calls, you have to have your phone connected to Bluetooth to be able to talk. In some cases this can be bad for the driver and other people driving on the road also. If your phone isn't connected to Bluetooth while you're driving, there can be a high risk of a crash when you're connecting your phone to Bluetooth. In some cases, there could also be an emergency call you have to answer, and people that don't have Bluetooth in their car can be effected by this law. The ""hands free"" law shouldn't be a law.

Although the government thinks the hands free law is going to help the risk of crashes, the hands free law could be much less safe than using your hands. ""Incredibly, they also spent less time watching the road, even when they were texting by voice."" Stated in the Text Free is No Safer to use while driving. The Texas A&M Transportation institute studied people driving a closed course under three conditions: while texting by hand, while texting by voice, and by not texting at all. It seems as if texting by voice should be safer than looking at your phone, but studies show that texting by voice and by looking at your phone, the reaction time is still the same.

The hands free law can affect you in a positive or negative way. Yes, talking on the phone while your driving is a dangerous distraction. ""Many studies have shown that the level of distraction has more to do with the intensity of the conversation"" Stated in the ""Total bans may be impractical"" debate. Studies show, an in depth conversation that requires a good deal of thought causes a higher level of distraction than a relatively short. The time and the length of the phone call is what is dangerous.

Even though the hands free law can help with the risk of car accidents and keep people off their phones while driving, studies have shown that wether your texting by voice or looking at your phone the risk of crashing is the same. The hands free law should not be in play.                  ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Texting and driving is a big distraction putting people in harm's way because people cannot do two things at once and most accidents occur because of texting and driving.

Cell phones can be a big distraction in the world. Most people get addicted to their phones that they can't live without them. People need to have their phones on them all the time. When they get notifications they have to look no matter what they're doing. When they get a notification while driving they get distracted so now they're not focused on the road that puts them and other people in danger. Cell phones distract people from the road which may lead to an accident. Some people think they can multitask by driving and texting but that's not the case.

Multitasking is a hard thing for human beings. Even if you think you are multitasking the human brain can only process things one at a time. While people are texting and driving they are only focus on one thing so they can crash at any moment because they're not focused on the road. This puts everyone in danger. This is why states have put strict laws so that people wouldn't text while driving. This is why texting while driving is a leading cause for car accidents.

When it comes to car accidents, most of them occur because the driver was distracted.

Most likely they were using their phones. It was reported that, "" A distracted driver is a motorist that diverts his or her attention from the road, usually to talk on the cell phone, send a text message or eat food."" As it states most accidents are because of cell phone distraction this is why they made laws to try and stop texting while driving. Right now this is the leading cause for car accidents and we have to try and prevent it from continuing.

Texting and driving should not be permitted anywhere as it distracts the driver putting everyone in danger. All this causes people to die or get severely injured this is why people need to put their phones down for a while and focus on the road. This way we have a safer environment for everyone.

The issue of driving while the person is on the cell phone and is a major issue in Georgia and all the other states of America. Many accidents are happening daily, and people are losing their lives. This way many fatal accidents happened, and even small kids lose their lives. The Law has been made in Georgia that requires hands free driving, that means people can drive and talk on the phone without touching the phone. The Law is still not as helpful as expected because many people ignore law, many people's mind is still distracted, and many people still use their hands for navigation. The first reason is many people are still ignoring the Law because the charges are very low, if they get caught the insurance rates are nit going to hike much for them. Auto correct mishaps are hiking, and people are texting, even if it is not legal. It is more dangerous than drinking and driving. The Law must be strict and have a penalty that must be $1000 dollars or get arrested. Just in case of emergency, driver should pull over and talk on the side if the road. The second reason is many people have stressful jobs and they attend a conference call or any stressful situations in the family front while driving. This can distract their mind from driving and even the hands-free driving Law can't be helpful to prevent car wrecks. In this situation, the law should be made very strictly that person can talk hands free for only few minutes and eliminates other conversations while driving, only important conversations should be allowed. This law can save so many pedestrians too, who runs into a car wreck daily. One example is of an old lady in Atlanta she was run over by a driver in the evening and he didn't even stop after words two weeks ago, according to the news. The lady ended up dying on the street right on the spot. The third reason I have is people do not talk over the phone always, but people can use their phone for navigation, music and apps. So those things are also distracting. The law should be made by the government that they can tract the minimum usage while driving and even if they must set up the navigation, they can pull over and do it. So, they can pull over to the side to use the phone and should be made on the interstate and the street. In conclusion, the usage of the cell phone in the car can't be eliminated totally, because cellphones are for emergency use. By only communicating important things and concentrate on driving it can turn into a car wreck and pedestrians can get into an accident.

3D1C987B7AB2,"On the contrary car crashes due to cell phone use goes up each year. People lose their lives daily by trying to do something that may be so simple to them. Maybe trying to change a song, text someone back, take a picture, etc. People do not realize that anything can happen in the blink of an eye. Just like that loved one of yours could be dead or severely injured. You should never be on the phone by any means while driving.

For this reason, I think you should always be hands-free while driving no matter what.

Think about ""Even at 60km/h, your car is travelling at more than 16 metres per second, so in those few moments your eyes were on a screen rather than the road you moved far enough to not see a motorcycle, a pedestrian, or someone braking suddenly in front of you.""You being on your phone while driving you put your life potentially at risk and other drivers. Causing us to have accidents that could have been avoided but now is a serious problem because someone may be hurt. A text message or skipping a song is worth more than your life or someones else. Therefore will driving always keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.

In addition, being on the phone while driving causes a two-second distraction. Increasing the chances of you being in a car crash. For instance, ""mobile phone use while driving increases your risk of accident by up to 400 per cent, points out that, in 2016 alone, police in NSW charged 39,000 people for doing so (100 drivers a day are busted for it in NSW and VIC)."" Just put your phones down and focus on the road. You don't want to be the person who may have killed someone loved one. You never know at the time if it may be more then one person was in the car at the time of the accident and someone may have gotten injured. Now you have to take responsibility in that situation when it all could have been avoided if you have chosen not to use your phone while driving.

Generally speaking, everyone knows right from wrong. Doing anything, in general, that may distract you even in less of a second is just something you shouldn't do. Innocent people have been killed or severely injured due to these kinds of things. Now someone may have just taken their last breath of fresh air, someone may have taken their last steps and is now paralyzed. This has been something that has been a problem for a while and should have been put a stop to it.

In the end, we all make our own decisions but deep down we know which one is right. No one wants to live with that guilt in their mind for the rest of their life knowing they were the reason someone's family or friend passed away. Don't be the reason, be the person who does the right thing and making it safer on the road for people.

The use of cell phones while operating a vehicle should not be allowed. Today in society people do not realize how much cellphones have affected the way people drive. It is and it has been a danger for a while now. There are many dangers due to the use of cell phones most people do not realize that they really are.

To begin with, the majority of car accidents that happen everyday are usually caused by people who are using their cell phones while driving. They tend to use their cell phone while being on the road thinking they can multitask when in reality they can't. People do not realize the kind of accident they can cause by replying back to a text or just reading one. That one simple reply can take someone else's life in a blink of an eye. Once it happens there is no going back, it's not like a message where you can delete or go back to that one specific text.

In fact, using your cell phone is a bad choice to do while driving on the road. There are people with kids in their car trying to get back home or on their way to spend time with some family. Most of these people do not make it back home or to their destination due to either a car accident caused by people who are distracted on their phone. There are children who do not know that a simple phone they use to watch videos on is a bad thing for them. Not only is it a bad thing but it can cause serious outcomes to anybody who is just driving and going on with their life.

To tell the truth, the use of cellphones while driving is illegal in most places. People can get a ticket and get fined for doing so. There are many penalties that people can receive from getting a ticket. For example, some may pay the fine and get demerit points to your license. These demerit points provide a balance and check anyone's driving; they are either added or subtracted from your license. These point vary based on the type of convictions you get. If you go over the number of demerit points based on the type of license you have your license may be suspended. People need to know that you will get a consequence for using your cellphone while driving. It may not seem like a big deal but in the real life it is.

As a final point, the use of any type of cell phone should not be allowed by anyone who is driving. No one really knows the kind of danger cell phones be putting people in. Yes it's a small device almost as big as the size of your hand but it can cause a serious accident. Cell phones may not seem like a big deal to people nowadays but in reality they can be deadly.         ",5,Phones and driving,Independent

Technology has brought us together and it is still developing for even more. We have electricity that fuels the car, we have cellphones that control TV's, and we have a computer that does things humans have hard time doing. When technologies combine, they make our lives easier; likewise, using a cellphone while driving is okay.

People may argue that using a cellphone while driving is dangerous but any technology, if used wrong, can be deadly to not only ourselves, but lives around us. Therefore, people should be able to use cellphone while driving, but in a manner that is reasonable. Using GPS (Global Positioning System), to guide your way or to listen to music is a good example of using cellphones safely.

Using a GPS system on your phone while driving helps us to get to our destination easier and lets us focus on the road better. If we did not have a GPS and we were to look for signs to go anywhere, we would be very much likely to get distracted or get tired quickly. Yes, it is true that we can replace our phone's GPS with a GPS device, but again, if the driver is not misusing cellphones, it is essentially getting the same job done. Also, because smartphones are easier to control and easier to interact quick than a GPS device, it will reduce the frustration of the driver.

Listening to music can help the driver focus better. It can also wake up a tired driver up by blasting some music. However, a GPS device cannot do that; with its monotone robotic voice, it would make the driver get even more bored. Another reason why a smartphone cannot be replaced by GPS device or why we should be able to use our cellphone is that, in the case of an emergency. Drivers can easily access a smartphone and call for help while if you had a GPS device, not so much.

In conclusion, I think that we all should be able to use a cellphone while operating a vehicle. Of course, not in a way that they will be completely distracted by it, but by limiting the applications that we can access. Again, anything can go wrong if used incorrectly, so I do not see the reason why we should ban a cellphone from using it as a tool to help us drive better. However, the punishment for misusing such a device should be punished heavily. It is truly sad to see how many people are getting distracted by a small device and killing lives after lives. Cellphone usage while operating a vehicle should be monitored, and managed, by the government or the police, with a strong action, however, banning of a usage of smartphones will cost just as same amount of lives as if it was not.

So everybody knows the question should drivers be allowed to use their cell phone while driving? Now depending on who you are this answer might be different. However, for me it's a no. Drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving because the use of cell phone is distracting.

Driving is a privilege and can be taking away so it's best to just put away distractions.

Now you and I both know cellphones are distracting as I mentions in my first paragraph, but how are they distracting? Well they are distracting by sending e-mails, texts, or pictures. Driver think that if they get a text that they can just respond really fast. However, those three seconds you take to respond can be the cause of a huge accident. Drivers just need to be aware that text can wait because you do not want to put yourself and others in harm over a text.

Finally let's get on to the facts. Statics show that about 1.6million crashes happen each year due to cellphone usage. They also show that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to car accidents and 9 of those deaths are due to distracted drivers. But car accidents can be costly in other like increased insurance and fixing cars hurt you financially or you can break a bone and be hurt physically and financially because you have to pay for medication. These can also lead to other very stressful situations.

So to conclude if you are driving do not use your cellphone. The text or e-mail can wait until you have reached your destination. If you do you can harm yourself and others. Overall using a cellphone while driving cannot only be deadly but costly.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent
4C69F84BA485,"Cellphones are mere distractions from focusing on the road, there have been nearly 400,000 accidents from one device.

The only appropriate way to use cellphones are using them as map directions, Teenagers and adults should be restricted using their phones while going out driving. Motorcycles are no different from cars, they are more difficult to control driving with one hand on the handles. Parents should only let teenagers drive if they are trustworthy from using their phones.

Parents should also buy a safe and advanced car to provide GPS and hand-free calls. Vehicles nowadays have screens installed which have cameras on the back to see what is in the way, the vehicles have Bluetooth for your phone without distracting you from using it and rely on the car for your safety.

This year have been 586 accident that did not end well. When driving, make sure all passengers have seatbelts on and be aware of the passenger's condition and position due to the airbag that could possibly hurt a child in the front seat. Do not consume any alcohol or harmful chemicals that influence your driving   ",2,Phones and driving,Independent

Their prevalence in today's society is undeniable and has become one of the world's most widespread tools. Their knack-like size employs their use at almost all times, allowing their beholder to multitask while using the device. This one small trait is the very essence of people's disagreement with them. Many people stand against using cellphones and driving as this creates a problem for all drivers near and far. Cellphones should not be used while driving if you wish to be able to use it again.

The age of cellphones started, what seems like, yesterday and they had already grabbed the public's eye. They allowed people to stay in touch even when the ones they wish to touch aren't near by. This very reason is what created the epidemic and addiction to cellphone, connection. The connection across all boundaries is what's gotten so many people glued to their cellphones. People nowadays can't go 10 minutes without checking their phones. Almost everywhere you go, phones-phones-phones, their everywhere, in people's hands, to people's ears, in their pockets, their unavoidable. It's even gone so far that many professionals have begun questioning if cellphone addiction is real.

Another major part of the problem is teenagers. As teenagers began to transition into the real world, some the first things they get are cellphones and their driver's license. The phone almost always becomes an attachment. Along with the freedom to drive, this creates problematic gaps in society. Many teens are not the most focused individuals. They are often guided by impulse rather than intellect, and the simple beep of a text message is just the right impulse. A simple ""L.O.L."" is all it takes to ruin their young lives. A few short words could potentially take the premature life of someone all because there hasn't been any real steps taken to not allow this.

In conclusion, cellphones' grasps on the world is one that is hard to deny or shake. Many individuals have even become addicted to their devices. This addiction has caused a grave number of problems for the world such as accidents, car wrecks and even death in some cases. These tragedies have heavily impacted our youth as they are some of the most at risk an afflicted. These young people are our next generation and we should try our best to protect and guide their lives to the greatness they can achieve. Therefore, cellphones should not be used while driving.

BD75DE5E2312,"The use of cellphones while driving should not be allowed at all. People put themselves and others at risk, safety should always go first. Throughout the years cell phone use has increased a lot. People use cell phones daily, sometimes when walking you don't notice where you're going and bump into someone. That's something minor but let's say you're driving while using you're device that's major, a car accident may be caused.

I believe cell phones should not be used while driving because it's a big distraction. Car wrecks would be avoided, which decreases the amounts of deaths. Also the person that was distracted is most likely the one to put at fault this may lead to lawsuits. Even if texting while driving were to be legal that does not mean it is safe. We should avoid all types of distractions while driving.

Another reason is because if you are caught using you're phone while driving by a cop or because of an accident. You're car insurance will be affected, if you were already paying a lot it's most likely that the payment will now be doubled. That could be easily avoided, another reason is that you shouldn't put at risk your passengers. It is better be safe than sorry.

There is a lot of reasons this should not be allowed. Safety should be taken serious. Car accidents, lawsuits, being hospitalized is not a joke, people die due to others being distracted when they're on their phones while driving. We should avoid any type of distraction while driving to avoid bad consequences.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent

Cell phones are essential tools in society that humans use to perform day-to-day operations such as communicating with others, checking the weather, and researching random topics on the Internet, however there is a time and a place for everything and cell phones should not be used by drivers in any capacity while operating a moving vehicle. Cell phones are helpful in many different forms, however they also distract you from what is in front of you. To use a cell phone you need to look at it which diverts your attention from what is physically happening around you. It is dangerous to not pay attention to what is happening around you when you were driving because it puts you and others at risk for danger. If a driver is not allowed to use their phone while operating a vehicle, then you eliminate the possibility of a car accident caused by the distraction of a cellular device.

Cons of a having a cell phone in a car

When driving, you need to pay attention to the road in order to get from your starting destination to your final destination safely. You can put yourself in harm's way when you are not paying attention to what you are doing. When using a cell phone in a car you are worried about what is happening on your phone and not worrying about what is happening in the world. You then have to switch back-and-forth really quickly to know what is going on in the road and what is happening on your phone. You can cause a major car accident which can result in the loss of life and you will become a murderer by law if you were distracted while driving. Drivers who cause accidents due to them being distracted by their cellular devices, are liable to those who were negatively affected in the accident and can be fine for using their cell phones in many different state. This reinforces the dangers that using a cell phone while driving hats.

Laws for distracted driving. In order to prevent car accidents, Government officials have put laws in place to lower the use of cellular devices while driving. Government officials have concluded that many distractions do exist while driving however cellular devices are one of the major distractions that cause the most accidents across many different states. Officials have tried to come back to this distraction by making cards with hands-free technology built into the dashboards and states have made laws prohibiting cell phone use while driving. To lower car accident rates Even further, employers put pants on the use of both hands free devices and cellular devices. Ever since state and employees have placed restrictions on cell phone use while driving, statistic show that car accidents have been on a decrease every single year.

The confident driver. A lot of drivers will argue that since they have been driving for X amount of time or because they perform so well on their drivers test, then they should be able to use their cell phones because they do not believe that they will cause any accidents. The science says differently. Science says there are many distractions on the road well a person is driving. People cause these accidents have been driving for various different amounts of years. Some of these drivers have been driving for 10+ years and others a few months. Win drivers who are using their phones at the time of the accident report there side of the story they always say that they did not see the other persons in some way, shape, form, or fashion. That is because the average reaction time of a distracted driver is 1.5 seconds. Accident reconstruction specialist also found that the average driver reaction Breaktime was to be 2.3 seconds. And with most driving accidents, a person has between about 0.7 to three seconds to react in avoid crashing. This reaction time of a human being is greatly slow with the distraction of a cell phone which leads virtually no time for the distracted driver to correct themselves.

Driving with phones

Driving with the phone is very dangerous to do. Cellular devices can and will cause drivers to divert their attention from the things surrounding them. Studies show that using cellular devices while driving increases the amount of car accidents. Using a cell phone while driving will slow down your reaction time when you are put in danger while on the road. In many different states, using your phone while driving is illegal. This is why drivers should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

1AEA362DB4A3,"Cell phones are an inescapable part of modern life, providing information and connection that has become an expected part of everyone's routine. However, this becomes complicated the moment your phone and car meet. On one hand, the GPS is an essential tool for any road trip, on the other, distracted driving is dangerous, and sometimes fatal. A balance needs to be struck, one where you can drive without distractions, and still get where you need to go.

For many people, the use of their phone is non-negotiable. Either for location, or for podcasts and music that break the monotony of a daily commute. At the same time using one's phone has a notable impact on one's performance driving. In many states, the solution proposed is to make it illegal to touch one's phone while driving. This allows a GPS to give directions, or for a person to dictate calls or voice commands while reducing the amount of time spent looking away from the road.

With hands free driving, someone can still interact with their cellular device, give commands, find directions, and communicate with others while still looking at the road. With smartphones offering voice assistants, it's no longer necessary for people to directly interface with their phones, meaning people are no longer spending as much time looking down at their phones and away from the road.

If people were no longer allowed to use their phones on the road, while crashes may decrease, people would be cut off from a world where doing so is becoming increasingly detrimental. It would be foolish to walk away from such increasing connectivity for an extreme solution such as banning cellphones in cars. Such a ban would be an overly drastic solution to a more nuanced problem, leaving people greatly inconvenienced for the sake of a heavy handed solution.

If a proper balance is able to be found between reducing the distractions phones provide to drivers and maximizing the amount of benefit still available to them, it would be greatly preferable to an all out ban on the devices in cars, and would reduce road fatalities and crashes while still maintaining the accessibility and convenience smartphones provide on a daily basis. So no, phones should not be banned on roads, but they should not be unregulated either, as with many issues, it is not black and white, and to approach it as such would be to ignore the vastly superior solutions hiding in the swatches of grey between the two extremes.

Is it hard for you to put your phone down while driving? Hopefully it isn't because there are so many things that could be prevented.

Most of the time, people who text and drive think they can do both things at once.

Previous studies have shown,""In the United States,3328 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes that involved distracted driving in 2012 alone..."". This shows that it's become very common which is absolutely wrong,your keeping you eyes off the road each time you glance over at your phone. As we know, anything could happen during that time you kept your eyes off for a few seconds.

Also a main reason why you shouldn't operate both things at once, is simply because it's illegal in some states. You don't want to be paying a fine much less do jail time. It's definitely not worth you being on your phone. And most definitely not worth your life or the life of others. For example,""A Minnesota woman sent and received 240 texts while driving one morning, before hitting and killing a motorcyclist on a highway exit ramp. she was acquitted of felony criminal vehicular homicide and instead convicted of careless driving,which carries a penalty of a month in jail and $50,000 in restitution"". It's very common for officers to check how long ago you were on your phone before the accident to see if that was what lead to it.

These accidents could be easily avoided, considering the fact that companies have built bluetooth in cars so that if you get a call you can pick up through the car. Or as plain and simple as it sounds just don't pick up the phone at all.

6D2AD3027292,"No Texting On the Road: Eliminating Distractions on the Roads

In today's society, everyone is forced to find ways to be the most productive they can possibly be in order to complete their daily tasks.

Commutes to work are longer and the accessibility of cell phones has never been so handy, but also so life-threatening.

People spend so much time in their cars, multitasking, especially in terms of checking messages and emails while in the car, is becoming a norm in society (Teen Driver Source).

But texting and checking messages, unfortunately, is not as harmless as people assume it to be when they are checking their social media feeds during standstill traffic or at a stoplight.

Just in 2013 alone, there were more than 1.2 million car crashes in America and of those 1.2 million, nearly 341,000 of those were caused solely by texting (Teen Driver Source).

Cell phones in the car are more than just a distraction, but a danger to the driver of the vehicle as well as everyone else on the road.

Some states within the United States of America have banned using their cell phones while driving, such as Illinois, but not every state has yet.

When one is distracted on the road, their attention to detail decreases, their reaction time slows, and they are more susceptible to accidents than they were before picking up their phones.

When it comes to driving on the roads, the use of cell phones while driving should not be legal around the country because it increases dangers on the road, increases driver stress, and it damages our brain health over time.

The first and most obvious reason as to why using cell phones on the road comes down to the fact that being distracted leads to potentially more accidents.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration conducts surveys every single year.

During 2017, 3,166 people died due to distracted driving (Federal Communications Commission).

Distracted driving entails more than just texting, but when further studies were conducted as to the specific causes of the deaths and/or accidents on the roads, more information supports the dangers of cell phone use.

Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) performed a study that found the average amount of time a person takes their eyes off the road when receiving a text is 4.6 seconds, and a lot can happen in that short amount of time (It Still Works).

The person in front of the driver could brake suddenly and if the driver is not alert and paying attention, they could end up rear ending the person ahead of them.

If the numbers regarding deaths on the road in relation to cell phone use are not as shocking as one might think them to be, it's important to analyze the total number of accidents instead to provide more clarity on the subject matter.

Just in a single day alone, according to the Federal Communications Commission, 9 people die in accidents and nearly 1,000 people are injured every single day as a result of distracted drivers (Federal Communications Commission).

Over the total year, that's nearly 365,000 injuries and over 3,000 deaths because of people becoming distracted on the road.

If that's not telling of the dangers of texting or checking phones while behind the wheel, then taking a look at how it can impact a single driver is significant to this argument as well.

With distractions, the level of stress drivers may feel on the roads increase.

When it comes to new drivers, this is a very serious issue, as they are both new to the roads and inexperienced in the typical driving routine.

New drivers have a lot to worry about, and adding the stress of text messages or phone notifications makes it more difficult to be safe and present when behind the wheel.

For new drivers and parents alike, there are several recommendations that the Teen Driver Source makes: complete calls or texts prior to getting into the car, get directions and figure out how to get to your destination beforehand, and check in with friends or family only after arrival (Teen Driver Source).

All of these are great tips for new drivers to remain safe while behind the wheel, but texting poses a threat to their attention on the roads, as well as the added stress placed upon them, on top of remembering all the other new skills they are learning as new drivers.

42% of high school students, in a recent study on Teen Driver Source conducted in 2015, admitted that they texted within the last 30 days (Teen Driver Source).

Multitasking promotes more stress, as told by many studies accumulated by organizations studying drivers and their habits while on the road, and for new drivers, attention to detail is imperative (It Still Works).

If high school students admitted to driving and texting at the same time, many of them also admitted that they forgot to wear their seatbelt while driving, which further would increase their risk of injury, or in the worst case scenario, death (Teen Driver Source).

Those under the age of 20 years old are more prone to distracted driving, so it is important to take matters into their own hands (It Still Works).

Teens and all drivers alike are encouraged to not only put their phone away and take care of tasks before turning the key in the ignition, but to also put their phone on Do Not Disturb, a feature available from nearly every phone today (Teen Driver Source).

Eliminating stress and being entirely present in the activity of driving is a must, and for new drivers and experienced drivers alike, if everyone can be mindful of their habits on the roads, stress will decrease, as well as optimal brain usage.

In terms of health, using cell phones while driving is not a great decision for anyone.

Cell phone use while driving has been said to reduce brain activity by about 36% while on the roads, which contributes to a greater risk of injury and/or death and accidents (Teen Driver Source).

Over time, however, this habit could contribute to other areas of life.

Using cell phones while driving could translate to other aspects of a person's life, leading to what could be perceived as an addiction to technology.

Without constant connection to cellular devices, it could not only impact someone's attention on the roads, someone's brain health and optimization, but also what could become of someone's productivity.

This is not just a matter of driving, but a matter of quality of life.

Would it be productive or even healthy for someone to spend their entire lives glued to their phone, inattentive to the world around them?

When it comes to driving on the roads, the answer is clear: using cell phones while driving leads to less productivity and alertness, and the consequences are immediately present.

If society does not take accountability for one's deliberate attention to detail while on the road, there's more at risk than just one missed text or a late work assignment.

People's lives and health are at stake, as well as the quality of their daily routine.

Alas, cell phones are a great part of the world today, but they do not need to hold a great place of importance when behind the wheel.

It's more than just health and brain related issues or even the amount of stress drivers of all experiences face, but it's about danger.

Is it worth the risk to send that text to a friend while on the way to one's destination?

There's advertisements, stories, news articles, and movies about the topic floating around, but some people don't take it as seriously as it needs to be.

It's not about collective action, or rather many people doing the same thing at once, but about many people deciding to take action on their own accord.

So, it is up the individual: take action and be safe, or increase the risk for not only one person, but the lives of the many people one might face on their daily commute.

It's all a choice, but either way, the future will show the consequences of what society decides to make of this information.

Phones and driving has been a big issue in the past and there have been many arguments on should we have phones while driving. I don't think it's the phones in this problem or case, I think it's the teens they are not responsible enough to stay off their phones while on the road. There have been many car crashes and 70% of them are teens on their cell phones. Adults are also on their phone while on the road. There are a lot of lives being took In fatal car accidents, cars are not anything to be played with you only get one life. It was a law passed that you can't talk while driving but that's not the case because you can always use speaker phone.

In 2018 there was a law passed that the driver can't have a cellphone in his or her hand while driving but that law was senseless because of speakerphone. Phones can be very destracing while drivng because of people texting you and replying back to a message. It should be an outstanding ticket for those who are caught texting while driving. In 2016 there were 365 people killed in Georgia that means every day at least one person was killed that year. It has to be an end to these fatal car accidents.

I think there should be a law passed in every state that phones shouldn't be picked up in a vehicle by the driver at all unless of emergency. It's only fair to the community that a no cell phone policy should be passed because innocent citizens are dying. Car accidents are not just tied around phones because most accidents are people under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the United Sates. Eliminating cell phones would be just reduce accidents and keeping family and friends safe. Nobody wants to loose their life in a car from someone texting and not paying attention to the road.

Phones are mainly for entertainment purposes, when you are on the road you have to keep your eyes up and stay focused. When you are getting your driving license you should have to sign a paper saying you won't use your cellphone while on the road or you will be fined and loss of driving privileges. There has been to many people took from their family behind a car. Cars are more dangerous from the looks and airbags don't always save you. Often times the airbags hurt you.

In the future I wish to see a new law passed regarding cellphones while on the road. I feel like if they pass that new law the % of car accidents will reduce. It's going to be that one person to save our following citizens , and pass that law to help us as a whole. If this law do pass it will be a significant change in the deaths per year. Cellphones should be banned while on the road because the high death rate.

For instance, say you are on vacation and you were looking for a restaurant on your phone and fell in the water. But, if you're easily distracted while walking, imagine how much more distracting you'd be in a car. There's a right time for your phone, the car is not one.

When you're driving, you not only have to be aware of yourself, but your surroundings. Including construction, other drivers, and pedestrians. Already as a driver it's hard to stay focused when you have passengers and/or playing music. Now picture you're driving down the road and see a man on his phone hit a kid on a bike and speed off afterwards. There are many safety hazards while driving and adding a phone into the equation, only adds more. Georgia has just now recently added the ""Hands Free"" rule to where it's illegal to be on your phone as you're driving. There are over 1.5 million car crashes a year caused from phones and over 385,000 injuries a year. So, the no phone rule is very a good addition and one of the best laws I've ever heard of.

On the other hand, some people argue that it shouldn't be a rule. They give pointless points like GPS, or ""Important Phone Calls"". There are easy fixes to these. If you are worried about getting an important call, connect your phone to your Bluetooth on your car. If your car doesn't have Bluetooth, whenever someone calls, you could just put it on speaker. For the GPS part, all you have to do it get a device that'll hold your phone for you. It allows you to see any calls, messages, or the GPS. There are many fixes for why not to have this law, but no good reason on why it shouldn't be a law.

In conclusion, drivers should not be allowed to hold their phone personally in their hand while driving. If that means zero access in some places, then so be it. It's not worth someone losing their life because you wanted to text someone back or talk to your significant other. But, if have a device that holds it for you is allowed, that they be a win-win for everyone. There's a right time for your phone, the car is not one.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Do you believe texting and drive is bad and can cause car accidents or any terrible thing to happen? Honestly doing any like that can lead to no common sense especially when you have someone in the car with you. Over thousands of people die from a car accident situation which unlikely happy for love one's. I feel like more of this comes from young adults and teens because there still in that developing stage where this and that needs to be learned. Even though, car accidents happen you shouldn't be scared to drive or stop you from driving.

You should just be a lot safer than other with driving. But, if you happen to get a crash and it manage to be your fault you shouldn't take it all into that one mistake to.

There are a lot of things you need to realize with driving and texting. First of all if you do it you need to be cautious and smart about it. Because one if you need to text someone because it's an emergency do it at a red light or if you need to tell someone important then just stop somewhere . If you don't do none of the sort you can lead to accident or dealing with the cops. And, you can get in a lot of trouble with dealing with the cops. If you feel like driving and texting is ok then maybe it is to you only if you know what your doing and being safe with those actions. The statistics are very high for teens almost 11 die everyday texting and over 80% of people own cell phones.

Some people would say is sending that 1 small text important that causing your life or that other person life. Is it worth it because bad things happen everyday even if we don't want them too. Also , you can pull a ride with anyone and if there on the phone and you feel unsafe let them know that but if your scared you risking everything cause you never know what's gonna happen. The only thing you can really do is pray for the best to happen and keep living your life. I feel like every driver should be at least 17+ driving because at the age i feel like a little more common sense it should know by now what the rules are.

In, conclusion we know that texting and driving both don't get along or work out for people at the end of the day. Teens are the main people who get distracted because either there texting or playing with there friends in the car which seems to be a very bad idea knowing they are so very young. People always make excuses as soon as an accident happens with them. They try to say they were getting something that fell or telling one of there passengers in the back to stop knowing all they have to say is i was texting.

I feel like we should have this thing in the future where we get in the car our phones automatically turn off so then there would be no problem with anything. I say this because it's better than doing that one stupid thing then risking however many lives are in thart car.

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.

Many people today think using cell phones while driving are good ideas. When phones are being used in the process of driving you have a higher chance of causing an accident in the road. Some may also say that having your phone out helps you multitask things at once in a car so it would be a good thing. They would say you could send documents off if your late to work, if you need to order a gift for a person or even call someone to pick up something for you at home. Using a cell phone is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashing. Many people argue and say driving while using a hands-free device is not safer than using a handheld phone. In the U.S. the amount of car crashes due to distracted driving is increasing. Today I will be talking about how it is not a good idea to drive and text.

In this paragraph I will be discussing why it is bad to text and drive. When driving sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road. Using a phone while driving decreases the awareness on the road which leads to more car crashes. People will notice when you are on your phone and try to drive ahead of you just in case something might end up happening. Having kids in the car and you are on the phone talking is a big risk to you and the kids. The drivers on their phones will be paying more attention the person their talking or texting instead of the road.

When driving you have three distinct groups. The first one is visual distraction it involves taking your eyes off the road even if your looking at a GPS system or trying to check a child's seatbelt. The next one would be manual distraction it involves you taking your hands off the wheel. It happens when you are searching for something in a bag or trying to eat something. The last is cognitive distractions it happens when you are not mentally focused on the purpose of driving and instead everything else is important to you and the road is not.

There are associations that work towards getting people to drive more safer on the road. The AAA (American Automobile Association) says that the older they are the less likely they are to get in a crash. However, those drivers under the ager of 24 are in a higher risk of an accident because their minds are still being developed into the adult stage. Parents are losing their children because of phones being used on the road. Save a child's life and stop the use of texting while driving.

In this conclusion having a phone while driving is dangerous and reckless. Always worry about your life first before you even think about touching your phone.

First, we will talk about how it can hurt or harm loved ones.

There are numerous accounts of people who harm their family or friends by being on their phone while driving.

Also, some have to pay a generous amount of money for fines and violations of the law. Let's move on to lifetime injuries.

Some people obtain lifetime injuries from texting and driving if they don't die. Each year 390,000 injuries occur from accidents caused by texting while driving.

CELL PHONES AND DRIVING: A DANGEROUS COMBINATION

By now, most of us should know that cell phones and drive simply don't mix. But despite the well-publicized dangers of cell phones and driving, the use of mobile phones while driving continues to rise. Cell phones make our lives more convenient. But when they are used while driving, texting is considered to be one of the riskiest driving behaviors because it requires the driver to become visually, manually and mentally distracted. To view and send texts, drivers are forced to take their eyes off the road, their hands off the wheel and their minds away from driving decisions-limiting their ability to react and respond to road conditions and other vehicles.

LEARN - Become educated about why it's important to avoid the use of all electronic devices while driving.

People say that using cell phones while driving is a hazard and that is affects everything you do. I believe that using a cell phone to text or do anything that requires you to look away from the road is hazardous. However, I believe that using your phone to call is not hazardous because you are not focused on the screen, therefore it does not obstruct your view of the road. This is not a bad rule to be able to speak on your phone.

They rate of fatalities in driving incidents have skyrocketed over the years because of cell phones but I believe only looking at your phone causes the accidents. If you were on the phone, on a call, and not looking at your phone then you wouldn't be in as much danger. Stats show that at least nine people are killed every day because of distracted drivers, but it doesn't tell what they were doing on their phones. The distracted driver was most likely looking at their phone, due to texting or social media. If you're talking on your phone and not looking at it then I believe there would be fewer accidents.

In 2015, most teens admitted to texting while driving. When people started to see the dangers of it, using phones while driving slowed down. However, there are still a lot of things that people do that help the cause accidents. The crashes that happen now are made out of ignorance and not caring for what they are doing, but its harming people.

In conclusion the texting while driving scene is bad and we should stop doping it and we should allow phone calls because they are less dangerous and it still allows conversations and work to be done.            ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Thanks to technological advancements, here in the twenty-first century we have instant access to other humans, modern healthcare and even quick transportation. So what happens when those advancements are used in negligent ways that can put other people in danger? Take cell phones, for example. These are devices that modern humans use on a daily basis to communicate with each other. What happens when a cell phone is combined with the use of a car. It can be not only dangerous for the passengers of the cars but other people around the car as well. According to the United States, Highway Traffic Safety Administration Distracted driving involving phones took over three thousand four hundred and fifty lives in 2016 alone. Statistics and research clearly show why people shouldn't use a phone in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle.

First of all, due to recent legislative laws passed in various states, accidents involving cell phone use have been greatly reduced. Since the evolution of phones, going from corded phones to cordless, to flip phones and touch screen, phone use while driving has become more common with each advancement. Texting and driving became sensationalized in the mid two thousand, which caused bills like House Bill 1965 to be passed in Oklahoma, which made texting while driving illegal in the state. After passing that bill, fatalities in Oklahoma dropped a whopping thirty percent. The law also helped lower injury crashes by twenty-two percent, and it showed a twelve percent overall decrease in car crashes. This data showed the impact that phone use while driving was indeed dangerous. In over forty-seven U.S states, texting and driving are considered illegal. While in over twenty U.S states its completely prohibited to use your phone while driving. These precautions were taken because texting while driving was extremely common, as well as dangerous, and not taken as seriously. The mixture of negligence and convenience caused injuries, fatalities, and crashes.

Secondly, cell phone use while driving is recognized as dangerous by many Americans.

According to an anonymous poll from the United States Highway Traffic Safety Administration ninety-four percent of drivers realize the dangers of texting while driving. But of that ninety-four percent, thirty-five percent admit to still doing it. Many people choose to use modern advancements in a way that places themselves, and others in harm, knowingly. One out of every four car accidents in the united states is caused by texting and driving. Texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident, compared to drunk driving.

Phone use causes a four hundred percent increase in attention off the road, which will most likely result in a crash.

Many people would argue that you can't stop people from using phones while driving, here are some ways we can eliminate the use of cellphones while driving. Things like ads, laws and even outside prevention can help stop distracted driving involving phone use. Phone company AT&T launched A campaign to inform consumers about the dangers of using phones while driving. After that campaign ""24.5 million consumers pledged to not to drive distracted on its site, itcanwait. com."" Stats like that can show us how raising awareness via even everyday ads, can help prevent more tragedies.

In 2017 AT&T launched drive mode, a driving app designed to keep users from using their phones while driving. When the app is turned on, it uses the phones navigation sense to track if the phone is going over twenty-five miles an hour. Once that speed limit is triggered, the app can send out automatic responses to incoming text messages which keep the driver focusing on the road. The app has over 250 million downloads in over one hundred countries. This shows people are willing to take precautions if informed, and given options.

In conclusion, phones should not be used in any capacity while driving. Stats show that phone use while driving can cause distractions, which may lead to fatalities. By implementing laws such as house bill 1965 in Oklahoma, we can help prevent distracted driving. Data shows us that by passing laws and using consumer awareness tactics, we can successively decrease phone use while driving. No phones equal fewer distractions which reduce car accidents and preserves our lives.               ",6,Phones and driving,Independent
BA9227119C87,"Should people be able to use phones while driving?

Cell phones should not be allowed while driving. Using a phone while driving should not be allowed because they cause car accidents, deaths, and insurance to rise. Studies show that a cell phone can put drivers at a greater risk of a car accident. Even though it still is dangerous, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. People think that it is safe to drive hands free, looking down because they can drive without them. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

People who have jobs that depend on phones say that they always have to be available to answer the phone even while they are driving. Because of these habits they can create a dangerous environment for them ad people around them and can cause collisions. Business related jobs can also be stressful ad cause emotional stress that can lead to a bad tragedy. The conversation can possibly cause the person to be upset and can lower their driving ability, which can lead them to losing control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

People driving hands free is also another thing that can be dangerous because they think that they are very skilled drivers who know what they are doing. There are devices that people can be safe, but that is not always the case. Hands-free devices do not take away the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. According to some studies, they show that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. That means that people can possibly miss a stop sign, hear a horn or siren, not paying attention to traffic lights, and looking out for their surroundings. This is a huge problems because more and more people can die or be extremely injured from this because some drivers make very poor decisions.

People say that phones can be useful in emergency situations. While that can be true, there are also some cons behind it. If a person were to get into an accident, they would have trouble finding their phone because they cannot reach it or it is nowhere to be found. People should not rely on their phones especially when it comes to emergency situations. It's not going to always help to use a phone when it is out of sight to where you cannot see it. There are services that people can use to get help through these kinds of situations. In case there is an emergency, you can have the service contacted through a device that is equipped to your car knowing your exact location. This will better your situation more than using your phone.

If people do not change their ways on driving with phones, more and more accidents will happen overtime. Phones are never that important to be on while driving because you can always call or text that person back when you are done driving. There should not be any more accidental deaths of pedestrians or children that want to cross the street and get hit by a person making poor decisions. Any person who is caught texting ad driving should be fined for people their life and others in danger. The world needs to be very aware of this serious situation and make a change.

The use of cellular phones has spread like wildfire in the last ten years. It has become a part of everyday life for many American citizens, and a good number of people depend on them to carry out daily operations. Unfortunately, many of these daily operations occur while the individual is driving. As a result, many accidents have taken place in the last ten years due to the use of cellular phones while on the road.

This leads me to believe that if people can't concentrate on the road while talking on a cell phone, they shouldn't talk at all while driving. Rather than restricting access, the goal should be to provide in-vehicle information systems and safer means of using your cellular phone while driving. I understand that restricting cell phone usage while driving altogether isn't the best means for solving the problem.

I do, however, believe that more safety precautions need to be taken for individuals who will be talking on their phones while driving. Phones are being created by Erricson, Motorolla, and Nokia today in which offer a hands-free cell phone so that you can keep both hands on the wheel while driving and talking. Some of these come in the form of headsets and give the user a voice-activated sequence, which allows you to talk into the speaker, and the number will instantly be dialed. Already this has eliminated the chance of your hands being off the wheel and having to do the act of dialing the phone. Both which allow you to keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.

Even hands-free devices that allow us to talk on the phone while driving with both hands on the wheel are still a hazard. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a lot of its energy into the conversation. This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction.

Whatever it is can almost always wait until you get where you are going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be as convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many teenage lives to Tweets or texts if they know their license could be taken if they do look.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use.

Cell phones have become a grave concern and a major cause of road accidents. Drivers using cell phones are not able to give their complete attention on roads exposing not only themselves but also other people on the road.

The use of phones on the road is a hazard to everyone even near the deadly driver. How many mor lives must we have to lose before giving more than a ticket is the only punishment.

To continue, the number of deaths that are done by a car is insurmountable. Distracted drivers are the main concern for pedestrians crossing the road. Approximately four thousand people were killed in the year 2015 due to drivers not looking at the road. Having a phone in the car with you is very important but only for emergencies. Now phones are used to text, play music on their phone,make phone calls,etc. Using a phone while driving is a safety hazard and should be punishable by a huge fine or even imprisonment. Vehicular homicide is a real thing and affects thousands of Americans each year. According to the department of transportation in 2018 3,477 died due to texting on the road.

Furthermore. the people being hit are not the only ones in danger when drivers use cell phones on the road. Drivers are killed because of their own negligence. On many occasions distracted drivers will hit trees,buildings,homes,etc. When drivers hit massive objects they cause more problems than expected. Drivers who use cell phones while driving can create thousands of dollars worth of damage,and could possibly ruin small businesses. All of this can be averted if only people stop putting their cell phone as a first priority. Let's stop trying to multitask. Any conversation worth risking our lives for is one not worth taking/

3F400A7BC136,"Do you use your cell phone while driving? More than half of car accidents that occur are caused by drivers who use their cell phone while driving. Maybe you should think twice about using it while you are driving. Drivers that put a hand on a cell phone while driving can cause them to get distracted and cause an accident. The car accident can lead up to taking a human's life. Even if the accident is not big it still could have been prevented by not using your cell phone.

Car accidents are one of the main things that are caused by drivers who use their cell phones but it's not the only things that gets caused by using your phone while you're driving. Sometimes you might pull your phone out at a red light but you don't realize the light has turned green which means you're causing traffic. Traffic is something mostly every driver hates. What if the person behind you has somewhere important to be but thanks to you you're holding them back because you got distracted with your phone? If someone is calling you and you have your phone in your purse or somewhere else in the car you're going to get distracted trying to pull it out of where you have it. If you have Bluetooth on your car you should connect it so it's easier to answer the call without having to try pull your phone out of where it's at. If you do not have Bluetooth, you should try putting your phone on do not disturb so that way you won't have the temptation to want to pull it out. Maybe even fully shut it down or just turn the sound off.

Every day, every hour, every minute as we continue with our life's a car accident occurs due to someone using their phone. Using your cell phone while driving is a big no. Phone calls are not the only thing that get you distracted while driving but you got to remember your social medias are blowing up which means you're getting a notification every here and there. Just knowing your friends texted you or someone posted / sent you something you'll most likely want to take a quick little glance at your phone but then that's going to want to make you use it for even longer which gets you distracted. Maybe you don't like what's on the radio so you want to use your aux to you can put a song you actually like if this does occur just wait till you're at red light but as soon as you're done doing that put it away you don't want to cause traffic. All of these things are ways your cell phone can get you distracted.

Stop using your cell phones while the car is on drive. Think about the people who are walking around you and driving around you. What if there's a baby in the car? Let's say you get in an accident you just hit someone's family think about what if that was your family who just got injured because you decided to pull out your phone, because you got distracted liking someone's new Instagram post, because you just had to take a selfie for snapchat. All of that could have waited till you got to your destination. Stop letting these little things get to you. Now think about it was pulling your phone really worth it now you just hurt not only the family but yourself, your car is all distorted. Everything that just happened could have been stopped if you only would have waited and not let your phone distract you.

Some people never realize how much a cell phone can actually cause. This because some people never stop and think about their actions. Yes, your cell phone might be small but the impacts it can cause are huge. Next time you want to pull your cell phone out wait till you get to your destination because a phone call or message is not more important than your own life. If someone important is calling your or texting just tell them, you were driving and they should be able to understand that.

A picture, song, video, etc. is not worth you getting yourself hurt or hurting someone else is not worth or even making some have a bad because you made them get stuck in traffic. Maybe you didn't even hurt yourself but you did hurt someone else just because you're ok doesn't mean you couldn't have hurt someone else bad. You need to get use to not having the urge to pull out your phone every time you get a notification. If you an emergency and you just have to use your phone pull over and park somewhere just don't pull it out and think you can multitask we you know you got to pay 100% attention to the road.

8003F62C4A0C,"Today, many humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. The introduction of the modern-day cell phone has made life easier. The cell phone has improved communication between individuals despite the distance. Cell phones have also made receiving information easier for the user when lacking understanding on a certain subject. In other words, the invention has made life more convenient, which resulted in dependence on the object. However, there must be a limitation to the usage of the object, especially when using the cell phone at that time can be life threatening. One of the many times that a cell phone should not be operated is while driving. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because the action is extremely dangerous for every person on the road.

According to the studies conducted by the National Safety Council, it was shown that using a cell phone while driving has led to 1.6 million crashes each year with 390,000 of them resulting in injuries. The reasoning behind this is when the driver takes their attention away from the road, the dangerousness of the situation increases by 400%. During the time the driver looks down at their phone to check a message, read the GPS, or receive a phone call, an accident can occur. Therefore, to prevent any accidents, all distractions must be eliminated, such as cellular devices. Moreover, by eliminating all distractions, the safety of everyone on the road is increased

After the realization of how dangerous the operation of a cellular device is while driving, more states started to amend laws against the action. As stated by the Governors Highway Safety Association, 47 out of 50 states and the District of Columbia have outlawed texting and driving.

As a consequence, violating the law can result in a large fine and even facing prison time depending on the state. The laws showed some form of effectiveness as the rate of traffic deaths among adults decreased.

Some may argue that using a cellular device should be allowed on the pretense that the driver is using the device as a GPS. This, however, is not true. Even though the driver is using the device for navigation, the probability of an accident occurring when distracted is still 400%. The GPS defense will also be used as a justification for operating a phone while operating a vehicle. Through the form of loopholes, drivers will use the GPS excuse against police officers to avoid the ticket.

The different sides of texting and driving, whether to allow it or not, is an irrational debate. The debate between the sides is a debate between what is right and safe versus what is fun yet dangerous. Many laws and economic consequences have been set into place to avoid the death and destruction of using a cell phone while operating a vehicle that can take place. In addition, cell phone providers have also run campaigns against the lethal act. One example of a campaign from a cell phone provider is the It Can Wait campaign by AT&T where surveys were conducted among teenage users. During the AT&T It Can Wait campaign, a survey about the teenager's views on texting and driving was conducted. Even though 97% of the teens that took the survey were aware that the usage of the device while driving was dangerous, 43% of them admitted to texting and driving despite that. While ignorance is bliss and most drivers highly doubt the possibility of an accident because of using a phone while driving, there is still a 400% chance of crashes occurring due to being distracted. Laws being passed to establish security among citizens are in vain due to the ignorance of people that do not care about the risks. They do not only put themselves in danger, but the driver is also responsible for the passengers, pedestrians, and the other people on the road.

Common enough for individuals to believe it's appropriate to be on their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Unfortunately, cell phones have overall become a huge distraction, especially while operating a vehicle. Driving should not be able to use cell phones under no circumstance due to innocent lives being put at risk, setting a bad example for children, and a higher chance of having a high insurance bill.

To begin with, when making the decision of being on your phone while driving not only are you putting yourself at risk your also putting other innocent lives at risk. Putting only yourself in danger is one thing but outing other in danger is another. As little as just glancing at one text you're selfishly putting an innocent individual in danger. Which demonstrates why one peek off the road can cause such a distraction. However, while making these bad decisions children around you are slowly picking up to your actions.

Secondly, driving and texting can set a bad example for the children watching. Now and days young ones are very observing, which cause them to catch on to things fast and think it's okay to do certain things. Very often you could be driving with younger individuals. While driving with these individuals your most likely older, meaning you should be a role model to them. Portraying that driving and being on your phone is wrong and shouldn't be done, so if you won't drive and be on your phone then younger ones will pick up on that and also won't.

Last but not least, driving and being on your phone has a possibility of increasing your car insurance. Since the hands free law has been strongly enforced so many individuals have been complaining about high insurance knowing they have been pulled over for being on their phone. Of course nobody likes high insurance if you haven't heard it from your mother yet. In fact, high insurance rates can be prevented simply by just waiting to answer that call or text. To help others out there is a driving mode that you can put on your phone to prevent you from being distracted from the rode.

All in all, driving while occupying a vehicle should not be allowed to prevent putting innocent individuals at risk, setting a horrible example for the minors around you, and to prevent high insurance rates. Overall driving and being on a cellular device is a huge distraction in our society as of today. Just one simple glance off the rode can suddenly change your life in a horrific way. Just taking a phone call is dangerous enough, so imagine texting. Take time in your day and remember if that text or call is worth your life before picking up your phone behind the wheel.               ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Now in days, many people know how to use a cell phone and even own a cell phone. Many people tend to use their cell phone while driving and many states have placed in a law that has prohibited cell phone use while operating a vehicle. Yet regardless of the law, many still question if this law should be in place.

I feel that people shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while behind the wheel because it's dangerous overall. Studies have shown that more than 3,000 people have been killed and 416,000 have been seriously injured because of a distracted driver. It has also been proven that cell phones distract a person by 37% while driving, meaning that you aren't as focused on driving and you are more likely to be holding a device with one hand. This limits the maneuverability of your other hand while driving. In 2006 a study was released by the university of utah which said the drivers that use their phones while driving are as dangerous as drunk drivers.

Many states have made a law that bans phone use while driving due to the increased danger. For example, in georgia it's prohibited to even hold a phone while driving. If caught, you could be given a primary offense. But then again, it depends by state and in fact, your insurance can go up if you get a ticket. It ranges from 4 to 30%. Many states like Florida, Tennessee, and 19 other states have a similar law in place. Currently, cell phone tickets don't go down as a dmv point but that might change on January 2021.

There are many stories of horrible accident that happened while using a cell phone and driving. For example, in minnesota a 17 year-old killed a 10 year-old and her father when she ran a red light because she was texting. She is expected to serve 4 years of probation and over 200 hours of community hours. In kansas state university, a 19 year-old died because of a one letter text. And now her older sister educates teenagers on the risks and dangers of texting and driving. In reality, these drivers aren't just putting their life in danger but they are putting others in danger too.

With all this information, I stick with my decision that people shouldn't be able to use their phone and drive. It's just a very dangerous decision. And even though there's a law in place to help improve this problem, people still tend to ignore it. They're putting everyone, including themselves, in danger. Innocent people shouldn't be in danger and it's not just grown ups but little children. Nobody should be in danger over something that can wait.

Williams was not wearing a seatbelt and was ejected from the car after crashing. Two days later sadly succumb Sydnee to her injuries and passed away.

Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. Drivers should not be able to use their cellphones while driving, for the reason that the use of a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle is exceedingly hazardous for the driver, as well as others who are traveling along the same road. The use of mobile devices while on the road leads to distracted driving which means that the driver is less likely to notice road and safety signals, Pedestrians and the signals coming from other vehicles. Failure to heed these signals has led to injuries and death that could have been prevented had the driver not been using a mobile device while on the wheel. In the U.S., there are laws banning the use of mobile devices or the act of texting while someone is on the wheel.

The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics"").

The penalties for texting while driving could include hefty fines, license suspension, a rise in auto insurance rates, and prison time. The consequences you'll face for texting and driving are similar to those you'd get for another of the most serious driving offenses.

Texting while driving is bad because it can bring fatal damages towards life. It may ruin the lives of others or worse might cause your life to end. Texting is a huge distraction to all drivers. Numerous drivers do not take this life threatening habit seriously and try to argue that these are an exception to these rules.

Texting may be useful, but the use of it can also be very bad. You can not keep both hands on the wheel so accidents may occur. It may put you at greater risk because you fail to see important road signs and signals. Sometimes a stressful text can provoke anger, which might affect your driving behavior. Texting while driving is a horrible idea because you need to look at the phone as you type and read incoming text messages. The vehicle might run over hole or wrong rails which might lead to car accidents. Texting while driving is dangerous and does kill, and has many times. Using a cell phone particularly texting while driving requires the driver to turn his mental attention to the device manipulate it with his hand to look at it.

Texting and driving should be banned because it is a hazard, and is an alert that needs to be reduced. The first reason for texting or using a cell phone while driving is very hazardous to yourself and the people surrounding you.

Cell phones during reduces the mental capacity of drivers as they fail to concentrate on minor or major activities happening around them. Focus of the driver is not on the road or traffic and it becomes difficult to handle the phone and the vehicle at one time. The understanding, vision, general awareness, and concentration of the driver are impacted while communicating on the cell phone during driving. Especially during horrible weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation pay less attention to the areas increasing risk of fatal accidents.

The main advantage to avoid using cell phones on the road is guaranteed safety of a driver. By making conversation , writing messages , or just playing with a cell phone increases the chances of accidents. The awareness of events happening around vehicle has a huge impact on driving.

Just imagine that one is driving to work to rush during hour traffic and one notices that there is a backlog of cars approaching the exit. Two cars and a police car are positioned near the exit. It looks like an accident occur and one can assume that the use of a cell-phone probably was involved. Sadly enough, most of the accidents today can be attributed to the use of cell-phones as the root cause. Drivers should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause accidents that could be avoided.

To begin, some people have a tendency to engage in behaviors that are not good- smoking, swimming in shark infested waters, drugs eating excessively- and using a cell-phone while driving is also one of those behaviors. Cell-phones should not be used while driving because even a two-second distraction increases the risk of crashing. Even though it has been noted that drivers who use a cell-phone drive an average of two miles slower, there is still a risk crashing due to being distracted.

Also, driving while using a cell-phone can be compared to drunk driving because in both cases, a person does not have enough focus to carry out a task. However, distracted driving is harder to prove and report compared to drunk driving. Tools like a breathalyzer and simple walking tests allow officers to determine if someone has been drinking.

Even though everyone can agree that using a cell-phone while driving is dangerous, one of the major reasons that people use cell-phones is so that they don't get bored while driving and many people get to keep in touch with friends and family while driving.

Finally, someone who is stupid enough to text and drive increases their risk of dying by 100 percent. That statistic alone should make one not use a cell-phone while operating a vehicle.

Not everyone, however, know how to control their urge to check his or her notifications every few seconds. When on the road, this lack of attention has made texting and driving one of the number one driving related accidents in the country.

Most know that if he or she crashes their car, there will be repercussions. For teens, it's the fear of their parents anger that stops them from texting and driving. For adults, it's the thought of not being able to go to work, due to a totaled car. However, both groups face a similar enemy when it comes to texting a driving, the insurance. Unknown by most teens, every crash that is his or her fault will cause their insurance prices to rise phenomenally. Should this happen, the driver may not be able to pay for the insurance, resulting it a car that can't be driven. For working teens and adults, this is not an option.

When thinking about texting and driving, there is a common thought, ""It won't be me."" This, however, can easily turn into a false statement. It only takes a moment of having ones eyes off of the road for things to turn sour. While a individual is looking down at his phone, a car could pull out in front of him without him realizing it. At high speeds a crash between the two cars could be deadly. No text or social media notification is worth the loss of a human life.

Those who text and drive will always claim that they great at multitasking, and so believe that they can easily text and drive on the road. However the brain cannot, in fact, multitask.

Instead, the brain switches between two actions, in this case it would be between texting and looking at the road. The same happens when individuals try to work on multiple projects at one. He or she will actually be switching between documents and slowly working on each. When driving, the eyes see progress in a text-to-text conversation as well as how far he or she has traveled on the road and assume that both were done at the same time.

No one, be they adult or teen, should text and drive. He or she could rear end another car or run off of the road, both of which would be very costly, and possibly deadly, The brain cannot focus on both actions, and will always prioritize either texting and driving, the former of which should be very dangerous, It only takes a few seconds for things to go awry, and the driver will be the one paying for it.

To begin with, today I am going to be talking about texting & driving some people do it anyways. That is why I am going to be talking about it and try to prevent it from happening. Many people die from what they do while driving and do not come out alive. Now that they got a law where you cannot drive and have the phone in your hand if you do then you will get a ticket.

However, should drivers be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Answer is no they should not be able to use one while driving. Because Studies show that driving while talking on a cell phone is extremely dangerous and puts drivers at a four times greater risk of a crash. Talking on a cell phone may be less distracting than some other activities people may engage in while driving. Other figures suggest that someone stupid enough to text and drive at the same time is increasing their risk of dying by almost 900 per cent.

One the other hand, and despite those dangers, how often do people do it? Using sensor data from more than 3 million drivers and 5.6 billion miles of trips, driving analytics company Zen drive found drivers are using their phones on 88 percent of their journeys. People still consider drunk driving as more dangerous than texting while driving. Yet the likelihood of an accident while using the mobile phone is six times bigger than the likelihood of DUI accidents. More than 25% of car accidents in the United States are due to texting while driving.

Therefore, so how dangerous is texting and driving? Texting and driving is a combination that has produced numerous accidents on the road, with a frightening number resulting to fatalities. There are Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk. So don't text and drive.

In conclusion, despite the laws forbidding texting and driving, many people still feel as if they have the right to text and drive. However, I feel everyone has the responsibility to put down the phone and keep your eyes on the road and drive safely. I strongly agree that texting and driving is the most dangerous thing that drivers can do on the road and people are injuring innocent people and we lose lives every day because of careless drivers.

Use of a telephone to any extent while driving has been prohibited in Georgia. Rightfully so, considering the overwhelming number of car accidents caused by a person using a cell phone behind the wheel. Drivers should not be allowed to use a cell phone while operating a motorized vehicle.

No human is able to multitask and do each task to the best of their ability. So why should people be allowed to do two tasks that require a vast amount of focus to complete at the same time?

According to The National Safety Council, use of a cell phone while driving caused 1.6 million car crashes each year. That means 1 in 4 car accidents were caused by texting and driving.

This has seen a tremendous decline in car accidents since the passing of this law. This only further proves that texting and driving is deadly and leads to immense amounts of casualties.

Texting and driving is very dangerous cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year and 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by driving and texting almost every accident in the world happens from texting while driving. There are three types of distractions while driving and they are manual, cognitive, and visual. Manual distractions is when the drivers hands is taken off the wheel in front of them and cause them to pay more attention to text message then the steering wheel. The next one is cognitive, cognitive redirects a driver's focus onto the conversation they are in and taking your mind off driving. After that the next one is visual this is different from the two because visual is the most important if your eyes goes off the road you automatically lose focus of the road ahead.

Now the only way to prevent all of these things from happening is to make texting while driving illegal.

82E9EDB64D5C,"The essay i am writing i will be talking about phones and driving and how it has become such a big problem. And how common it is now days for people to be on there phones while driving and mainly texting. Even doe we have came out with hands free law people still continuously text and talk on the phone which means they are not obeying the laws even if that hands free law is out. People still do it like if they don't care. That's a problem because there are more accidents being caused and the death rate is increasing.

In my opinion i say drivers should not be allowed to use cellphones while driving. Maybe if there using the gps but other then that they shouldn't pick up their phones while driving. If its an emergency call they should pull over somewhere. It's not right to cause accidents because someone decided to text while driving you always gotta think who your surroundings and how it will affect them. It's not right for someone else's mistake to take someones life away. So no there shouldn't be no permission to touch your phone while driving like ive seen before on previous signs ""it's better to be unread than dead"" .

Most death rates have gone up mostly caused by teen drivers because i see i all the time they are always talking on the phone taking pictures they just don't get how it's dangerous to do all that. And that in a minute you could crash or take someone else life away. In my point of view i think parents should have talks with these young teens on texting and driving and tell them not to do it because it's starting to get out of control and leading to bad things it has to come to a stop. The messages will always be there, there's no rush to open that message. So there has to be a couple of changes made because things aren't going the way there supposed to be and thats not good because people should obey the law just like they would to any other laws.

In all of my opinion i really don't agree with people texting it's just that they made that law to protect us from using our phones because they saw the whole death rate and accidents happening and just things going wrong. Why? Because due to the use of phones police are trying to do everything to get people to stop but it seems like there still doing it like it doesn't get to them. While driving you always have to be 100% focused in your driving always you can't be distracted because you never know what will happen next. That's why you always have to be focused to be prepared for whatever happens and be aware of what is going on while driving.

This is what my essay is about on how i agree with texting and driving if you put it in a way to think about how if this is something safe to do what would you think or say. I don't think it would sound safe to you ethier. So people have to start doing the right things and make a change for the right reason and not do the negative cause that won't get you nowhere.         ",3,Phones and driving,Independent

They could be watching tv and be scrolling down instagram, or they could be doing a simple task and their phone is in their hand. People have become so dependent with their phone that sometimes they take it to the extreme and drive while they are on their phone.

This is a major problem because drivers need to be aware of their surroundings. One of the main problems are texting and driving. This has led to many car accidents and many deaths. About 1.6 million car crashes occur every year (Teen Safe). In several states it's illegal to have your phone in your hand(Angela West, PCWorld). They have done this because the United States of America have called this an epidemic (Teen Safe). This is a epidemic because people are dying or getting hurt due to distracted driving.

If someone is conducting a vehicle their phone should be out of reach. People should consider pedestrians walking on the streets or the passengers in the car. Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day (Association for Safe International Road Travel). These death causes are preventable, because it's not a disease or an illness. Texting and driving makes you twenty-three percent more likely to be involved in an accident (Driving Test).

To conclude, people should drive vehicles without their phone. This could prevent thousands to millions of deaths. When driving a vehicle people should be aware of who is in the car or their surroundings.

Despite the suggestion , hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. Therefore , hands free devices wouldn't be a better alternative and would ultimately still lead to car accidents.

Opposition say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call-in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepared to help you in an accident.

Keep your eyes out for police.

Driving is our main way of transportation so we need to keep ourselves safe and everyone else safe. the best way to do that is to keep our phones away keeping your phone is smart while driving because texting and driving is a big no-no in everyone else's eyes. The only reason why I think people need to follow this is because I've driven with people who have sat at the light because they were stuck on their phones and I had to tell them to drive so, to be honest, we need to limit ourselves to do it only when are stopped in traffic or we just parked up somewhere.

I don't drive yet but everyone should just know this rule or just follow it at all times watch for police, police are like enemies they protect the streets and I respect them for that but honestly, they should always be avoided I'm not saying avoid them at any means necessary but just keep seat belts on and don't text and drive that's the easiest way a cop will catch you so make sure to get wherever you need to go and just move on try not to get in any trouble.

And to conclude phones are really convenient devices that make millions of things easier for us day to day humans but we need to limit ourselves to just using it when not driving and only when it is really needed many cars nowadays come with their own little carphone technology that will speak to you and do stuff for you.

Apps like Waze make driving feel much safer and cars like teslas and the other cars I spoke about before can be great substitutes for phones while driving.       ",3,Phones and driving,Independent

Though, they have also caused trouble in several ways as well. One of said ways is the severe amount of people who are distracted by them while driving.

As phones innovate more and more overtime, so does the amount of people who use them. Phones themselves are not a bad thing, the problem is how people often use them. There are a lot of people who will make text and calls, or even watch videos on their phone while they are driving. Doing this pulls the focus away from driving and causes danger for those who are distracted, and their fellow drivers on the road. On countless occasions people have gotten into accidents and wrecks all because they wanted to text a friend. Often these wrecks are fatal. Something needs to change.

Thankfully, more and more people are also realizing this anger will only grow if nothing is don't, so they helped to make changes. Here recently laws have been passed that make it illegal to be on your phone at all if you are driving a vehicle. Hopefully this will open more people's eyes to the severe danger we face every day without even realizing it.

Today, the majority of adults own and operate cell phones on a daily basis, such as, texting, calling, and being on social media communicating to one another. But while using a cell phone while driving in the other hand is utterly dangerous. First of all, you're not supposed to have your cell phone out when driving in the first place! This increases the risks of an accident, and worst case scenario, death. Anything can happen if you look away even just for one second off the road.

To begin with, let's talk about our senses really quick. We use our eyes to see, ears to hear, hands to touch, tongue to taste, and nose to smell. When we are driving we mainly use our eyes, ears, hands, and feet. We use our eyes to see the road, as well as other cars. For our hands we use the steering wheel to maneuver the vehicle, and our feet we use the pedals to determine the speed. Lastly, we use our ears to hear our surroundings. For example, if we were going to make a call/text on the cell phone, you will lose all of those abilities, because you are distracted doing two or more things at once.

In addition, the Hands Free Georgia Law states, ""all drivers operating a motor vehicle on any highway of this state are prohibited from: Holding or supporting, with any part of the body, a wireless telecommunications device or stand-alone electronic device."" This emphasizes that the driver is not allowed to write, send or read any text-based communication, including a text message, instant message, e-mail or internet data, according to the Georgia Department of Driver Services.

Lastly, this goes for the same as drinking and driving. Any alcohol consumed inside your body will greatly be affected in your driving ability. The Alcohol Rehab Guide claimed that, you'll have a ""slow reaction time, lack of coordination, reduce concentration, decrease vision, and inhibit judgment."" These are ways alcohol influences you, and your driving capabilities. On to the dangers of using cellphones while driving. The General Cell Phone Statistics reports, ""that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving."" These are numbers people need to start realizing that your life is more important than being on your phone communicating to someone else when driving.

In conclusion, using your phones while driving is prohibited. Based from these reports, there were evident factors to the point that cell phone use while driving does cause accidents. Therefore, that's why we have laws to prevent these irresponsible acts. Together we can end these numbers if we just take more control in ourselves.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Some say that hands-free set is safe because people can drive using both their hands. But, hands-free devices don't exclude the threat of causing an accident and may even be worse. Researches show that using a headset or ear/headphones can be as hazardous as holding a phone because the conversations sidetracks drivers from concentrating on the road. The problem is when a car swerves suddenly or a pedestrian step into the road, and the brain lacks the processing power to respond in time.

I am going to show my opinion about Texting or being on the phone while driving and, I show some you'll what could happened when you decide to be on the phone while driving. An I hope when you are reading this, I hope you chance your mind about texting while driving and I should thank all my reader for taking the time up to reading this essay.

When you are driving a car you hear a text pop up on your phone and you want to get it so bad and you do but, when you do you stop paying attention to the road for just a minute then a car behind you hunks because you aren't driving right and that make you jump so you start driving right. The driver was just lucky that he just got hunk at or it could've binned much worst like a car accident, and someone could have got hurt. In my opinion people shouldn't not be texting while driving because it only takes a simple mistake, and someone could get hurt. I think that it was a good idea that modern cars develop cars that you can call people and talk to people on the phone while driving plus they have their full attention. When you are texting while driving you looking up and down while driving and I would suggest people should put that do not disturb on your phone or you can put it in the glove department, so you won't be interrupted while driving.

My conclusion to all this is drive safe because I don't want to look on the news and see anybody getting hurt because of you are on your phone. If you don't care do it to save the other people from driving and I see why they are pushing this to be outlaws so there could be less accident on the road. I hope and thank you for reading my essays.          ",2,Phones and driving,Independent

People shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while driving. Driving while on your cell phone is dangerous and can cause a car crash, you to become distracted, and cause you to get a ticket.

Most car accidents are cause by drivers being on their phones. People are so focus on checking their message and texting that it causes them to lose focus and loose control of their car.

Banning cell phones while driving is a good solution and will reduced the number of car accidents.

Cell phones are distracting devices. If you are driving and your cell phone get a text notification, and it is distracting you, you are basically driving drunk. Your reactions are way slower than normal, and you are inattentive towards the road. Many teens and young adults are involved in wrecks because of their cell phones. Driving while distracted is a factor in 25% of police reported crashes. People are not aware when contact anything affects their ability to concentrate.

The use of your cell phones while driving can cause you a ticket. If you are on the phone while driving and you get stop by a police officer, you are most likely to get a ticket. In Georgia, there is a hands-free law which bans people from being on their cell phones while driving. No one wants to get a ticket for being on their phone, it will cause them money that they have to spend to pay the ticket. It's just safer to driving without any distraction.

To sum it up, people shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while driving. It is very dangerous to do so. It can cause people to get into car accidents, become distracted, and to get a ticket. The way to go about putting a stop to people driving while on their phones is to make a law banning the use of cell phones while driving in all the states in the US.

C1AD06518697,"The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads one point six million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from texting and driving. Texting while driving is something that people have done in the past, they are doing it today, and are still going to do it in the future. No matter how people are injured or have lost their lives to this people are still going to do it. Some of the main reasons that you should not text while driving is because; you can cause serious accidents that way, you are more likely to be blamed for causing the accident and it is illegal to be on the phone in some states.

According to a new study talking on the phone is hugely dangerous even if you are on hands free. There are thousands of people who get into accidents everyday because they were not paying attention to the road. They were to busy looking down at their phones to notice what was going on around them. If you are paying attention to what you are doing you can only injure yourself but you can also injure another person as well.

Most likely if you are texting while driving and end up getting into an accident then you are most likely to get blamed than the other person. There is a high chance of it being your fault because you were not paying attention to the road. Yow will also probably get charged by your insurance company and have to pay more if the other person decides to file a lawsuit against you. Being distracted for even one minute can change a whole lot and make a big difference.

Even though it may not be illegal in Georgia right now, one day it could become illegal for people to drive and talk on the phone. In the state of Missouri people under the age of 21 can not talk and drive at the same time. It is against the law because they are not of age to be trusted to talk and text while driving. They are at a high risk more than anyone else to get into an accident because they are underage teenagers who do not know how to stay off their phone.

Most car accidents are caused by people who think that they can drive and pay attention to the road while also doing something else. The main people who think that they can do that are the main ones that get into the most accidents and get the most tickets. Texting while driving is dangerous for you and for the people around you. That is why sometimes people say you have to drive for the people around you. You never know what someone is doing in there car and whether they are paying attention or not. They also have to do the same for you if you are not paying attention to the road and what you are doing.      ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

The use of phones while driving has escalated over the years and it is getting more prevalent and actions must be taken to not have drivers to be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle .

One reason as to why people should not be able to use their phone while driving is because the risk of death is so high . The use of cell phones while driving now has taken place as the leading cause of death in the United States . The leading cause before that was drinking while driving . Statistically ,1 in 4 car crashes in the United States are caused by the use of cell phones while driving . 391,000 people were injured due to that in 2017 which doesn't even compare itself to the low number of 39,773 gun deaths in 2017 . Both of these are horrible situations to ever be in but a lot of people are ignorant to the toll driving while using your cell phone is . Though the numbers are generally associated with teenagers , these statistics could be any ones' life .

Not could self phone use while driving be the cause of your own death , it can also be the cause of death of those around you as well . Some people view it was selfish that one person would risk sending a text knowing that it has the potential to kill an innocent person or peoples . A text can always wait when others' lives are on the line . Its an over-estimation of one's personal confidence when driving . Noone that texts and drives really thinks and analyzes the hard that they are doing or can do to all the people in the cars around them . In the cars are innocent mothers , fathers, children , veterans , teachers ect . It goes without saying that they don't deserve to die due to someone thinking that because they've texted and driven before , noone will die .

The actions that can be taken now to prevent so much fatalities currently is to lead by example . Even if at a red light , don't be a selfish person and respond to a text .

Our current culture has become too dependent on technology and we must learn to resist the temptation and impulse . We must realize that life is too precious and too valuable to let it be taken away due to a text message . Once we and other people realize how deadly and dangerous texting and driving is , we can prevent the statistics to grow even more for future generations .

Phones and driving is where one person is conducting a motored vehicle while on a cellular device. This has got to the point where the government has taken major action into making it illegal. This has caused a lot of accidents, deaths and tragedies in everyday places. People who are driving a motored vehicle shouldn't be able to text while driving its dangerous and irresponsible. Driving and texting is very dangerous and could lead to very bad punishments.

Texting and driving is mostly seen by around teenager and adult age groups. Adults from the age 18-33 admit they text while the drive. Texting and driving shouldn't be done by anybody it could lead to tragedies and even more. Teenagers from the age 13-17 admit they text at least once a month while driving in a motored vehicle. Texting while driving is a life-threating norm to families and other people on the road.

Texting while driving on the road is a very dangerous risk not only to the person behind the wheel but also the people on the road such as families. Phones, while having any cellular device while conducting a motored vehicle can be very dangerous. It could cause accidents and deaths, tragedies. Not only could you risk your own life but you would be risking the life of other innocent's people and families.

Texting and driving comes with many consequences with every action there is always a consequence depending on a good one or a bad one. There could be fines from $20-$500 depending in which state you are living in or the accident happens in. The worst there could be in consequence form, it could be life in prison, jail time, community service, and maybe death penalty. Texting and driving is something serious and not something to be taken as a joke.

In conclusion, texting and driving is just another way of making a tragedy or taking someone else's life's with just sending a text. Texting and driving can come with many consequences it could give you jail time, life in prison and even community service. Using a cellular device while operating a motored vehicle can do so much in just seconds, it needs to stop. Texting and driving is not a game and needs to be taken into serious action.                                                         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent
8D1FBE225540,"The Dangers of Cell Phone Usage while Driving

Over the years cell phones have been a key part in most people's daily lives. Cell phones can be used as means of communication, internet surfing, work, etc. While cell phones can be very beneficial in people's daily lives, they can cause much harm when used at the wrong time, such as when driving. Everyday people are dying in car accidents due to using their cell phones. Driving while using a cell phone is among the leading factors of car accidents, which can be fatal. Despite the danger, people still use cellphones while driving. Truthfully, cell phone usage while driving should be made illegal because it serves as a major distraction and can cause harm to others as well as the driver.

Numerous studies have shown that people who are distracted by their cellphones while driving are more likely to cause or be involved in accidents. The CDC estimates cell phone usage while driving causes one-thousand injuries and nine deaths a day. The reason is clear- the driver is not fully focused because they are distracted by their cell phones. This is extremely dangerous because the driver has their eyes off the road. A study from NHTSA revealed taking your eyes off the road for five seconds at fifty-five mph is equivalent to driving an entire length of a football field with your eyes closed. While looking at a phone while driving causes one to not have their eyes on the road, the use of a cell phone also decreases the driver's reaction time. A psychologist by the name of David Strayer once stated the reaction time of a 20-year-old using a cell phone while driving has the same reaction time of a 70-year-old driver who is not using a cell phone. It is clear cell phone usage while driving decreases one's reaction time greatly, while also prohibiting the driver from being fully focused on the road. This information should not sound new, people are quite aware of the dangers, yet it still takes place.

As mentioned, people know the dangers of cell phone usage while driving, especially teenagers. The dangers of distracted driving is fresh in the mind of new teenagers on the roads because they have just finished driver's education. Although teenagers know the dangers of distracted driving, 21% of teenage drivers are killed annually due to cell phone usage while driving. This makes me wonder why the number of crashes involving teenagers using cell phones are so high? The clearest answer is their parents. As teenagers ride with parents, legal guardians or adults who use their cell phones while driving, it makes the concept seem a bit more normal and okay. Personally I feel the reason many adults use their cell phones while driving is because they feel very experienced. People who have been driving for over twenty years are without a doubt typically more experienced than new drivers. While they do have more experience than new drivers, it does not mean they have mastered the task of driving while being distracted by their cell phone. This false idea many adults have leads to teenagers picking up on these habits. Differences could be made if adults did not text and drive, especially with children in the car. It could decrease the number of teen drivers who use their cell phones while driving. While adults not using their cell phones while driving with children would possibly decrease the number of young people driving with cell phones, it also makes the roads safer! That enough should make adults want to stop using their phones while driving. Everyone, teenager or adult, should want to put their phone down while driving to make the roads. This simple act can save thousands of lives per year.

It should not be a hotly debated issue whether or not cell phone usage while driving should be illegal or not. It should clearly be illegal. Consider the thousands of victims killed by distracted drivers each year. Cell phones can be great and helpful but, people need to learn to put them down! If people were not be distracted by their cell phones while driving, the roads would be so much safer. No notification one receives while driving should ever be more important than keeping yourself and others safe.      ",6,Phones and driving,Independent

There is a growing debate on whether or not people should use phones while driving. Most states have deemed it illegal for people to use phones whilst operating a motorized vehicle. Yet, people still continue to use phones to play games, check twitter, post social media updates, take snapchat videos, and even make video calls. I believe that drivers should not be able to use cellphones while operating any motorized vehicle no matter the circumstance and no matter the person.

Lately people using their phones while driving has become an increasing problem in today's society. Even with all the laws against it, road signs advising against it, and signs showing how many people have lost their lives due to phone usage, that still doesn't seem to deter drivers from using them. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. In the year 2017 alone there were more than 35,000 car related fatalities, most of which were due to drivers being distracted.

People don't seem to realize that a car or any sort of vehicle weighs at least 2 tons. Anything that is 2 tons can and should be considered a deadly weapon that can easily hurt or kill someone if not operated properly. Driving is already a difficult task, and anything that can take your mind off that for even a second could cause pain and grief. Not only will you and the people in your vehicle feel the pain and grief.

Anyone that is near you in another vehicle or walking can feel the pain and grief.

I'm fully aware that some people actually use their phones for good while driving. Some examples of using phones for good are getting directions, answering calls, reporting a hazard on the road, etc. But even then I believe they shouldn't have their focus on it for more than a second. Calls should be made handsfree or bluetooth and directions should be entered before your departure ensues.

In conclusion, yes there are good and bad ways to use a phone and opinions may vary on the subject. But I personally think that the bad outweighs the good by so much and phones shouldn't be touched at all during driving. We've already lost countless lives due to people not giving the road their full & undivided attention. So do us all a favor, put that phone down, and possibly save a life today.

Nobody should be allowed to use a phone while driving for any reason since it is very unsafe .As punishment they should get fined at least 500$ and get a tracker that doesn't let you use your phone while in driving motion.

Windows reflect whatever is on the outside so most of the time you can't see if someone is using a phone while driving. Texting while driving should be prohibited as it is a danger to themselves and to their society. It can lead to a car accident that could potentially get you killed.

""Sending or receiving a text message causes the driver's eyes to leave the road for an average of 4.6 seconds"" ,according to ""U.S State and Federal Laws Targeting Distracted Driving "".

Teens do not realize how unsafe it is to answer their phone for a friend at that moment while driving. Many teens just do not see it at all that they put their lives in harm's way. They also affect other people.

The 2019 Texting and Driving Statistics state that 36% of respondents ages 18-24 admitted to texting while driving, and 51% said they were ""very"" or ""extremely"" familiar with their state's texting and driving laws. Of those surveyed 48% said they thought driving under the influence of alcohol was more dangerous than texting and driving.That is false information. Drinking and driving and texting are both toxic because they both distract the brain off their main focus. In fact, texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk.

The Hands Free law should be more strict when it involves punishment. Instead of getting credits from their car insurance and paying a fine, they should actually get jail time so they can think twice about picking up their phone.Many people abuse the Hands Free Law. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

In conclusion, teens are not the only ones who get distracted by use of their cell phones.Many adults are in this category as well.When an individual gets behind the wheel of a 3000 pound vehicle, he should think about how many lives can be affected.

In a time where technology is so mainstream and more accessible than ever before, it has become essential to many people in their everyday life. Technology is everywhere and it will only continue to grow, however not everyone is as tech savvy and just stick to the basics like a cell phone. One of the demographic groups that has a heavy usage on cell phones are teens, who are constantly glued to the screen for countless of hours. Another thing that teens are really big on is getting behind the wheel for the first time and many tend to continue their bad habit of using a phone even when driving. This has quickly become a serious issue for teens and it should be addressed to prevent any more dangerous situations.

Everyone has the habit of occasionally looking at their phone to either send a reply to a message or to just skip to the next song, so we can't just point the finger at the teens. Although, teens are more prone to this behavior due to their constant need to use a phone than compare to an adult. Based on a survey conducted by GuardChild, 56% of teens admitted to talking on the phone while driving and 13% admitted to texting while driving. That is a total of 69% of teens, who are distracted while they are behind the wheel. For someone who is beginning to learn how to drive, it does not help out when you provide your own distractions. Driving is a serious responsibility that is not something to be taken lightly by younger drivers, no matter how casual it may seem.

Not only does using a cellphone while driving raise the chances of being involved of getting in an accident, but it also makes your commute more inconvenient. Being distracted by your phones divides your attention, which should be completely on the road to be as fully aware as possible. People are very aware of the issue dealing with driving under the influence and strongly stand against that, but in fact driving while using a phone is just as bad. According to the statistics provided by GuardChild, using a phone while driving causes a decrease in reaction comparable to legal limit of blood alcohol concentration of 0.08%. A driver should not be behind a wheel if they are incapable of maintaining full awareness of what they are doing and their surroundings.

Many people have realized that distracted driving caused by cellphones has become a real issue across the country and there needs to be changes made to prevent it. In many states, there have been new laws that have implemented to fight against this issue. Based on research done by the National Conference of State Legislature, 48 out of the 50 states, have passed laws that prohibit texting while driving and 18 out the 48, have no usage of handhelds while driving in place. However, not one state has an all cell phone ban in place, which could possible change in the future if current laws don't seem to be the solution. With these laws, driver receive fines that could cost them hundreds of dollars and could even lead to a suspension of license if drivers continue to repeatedly offend.

In conclusion, it is very important that drivers are aware of the real life consequences that could happen from something they seem to be innocent. Not only do drivers endanger themselves, but also any fellow drivers or by standing pedestrians. With everyone doing their part to help combat this issue, it can make all drivers safer on the road and with a little more peace of mind.

There are already many ways to help out drivers against the urge of using their phone, it is just a matter of choice on how safe they want to be. No text message is ever worth putting your own life in danger or other innocent people, it can wait because everything has its time and place.

Have you ever wondered about the dangers of operating a phone while driving? Should people be able to use a phone while driving a car? Will there be a future of using phone while driving? There is a great percentage of drivers that use their phones while driving a car. With many opportunities to use a phone while stopped at a red light or stuck in traffic, phones have been a danger to many people. Not being able to use a phone while driving a car is true because of distractions and car crashes.

Using a phone while driving a car is very dangerous. Most car crashes are caused by drivers scrolling through social media, taking pictures, looking at navigation, or searching for music (Evans Moore). Edgar Snyder & Associates states that ""There are about 1.6 million car crashes a year just because the driver is using their phone."" Those car crashes that occurred are all because of drivers attempting to use their phones. Our smartphones are a great resource to have and use but are a major risk to our lives if used at a wrong time and place. Phones should be used before starting the car and used after getting to the desired destination. Drivers should not be able to use a phone while operating a car because they are a distraction and causes many car crashes.

In my personal opinion I don't think people should be able to use a cellphone while operating a car. There are many people lives at stake because of reckless drivers. ""According to the report, cell phones caused 26 percent of car accidents in the U.S. in 2014. Text messaging causes 5 percent of crashes (Bey & Associates)"". Using the phone makes the driver's main focus go from driving to what is on the screen. The reckless drivers cause car accidents and that can cause major injuries. Some of those injuries can cause permanent damage while others are small injuries.

I am pretty positive that there would be a future of using phones and driving. Even though there are many laws that say using a phone while operating a car isn't allowed people still do it on a daily. There are many states that have already banned the usage of phones while driving. ""18 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands prohibit all drivers from using hand-held cell phones while driving. All are primary enforcement laws-an officer may cite a driver for using a hand-held cell phone without any other traffic offense taking place (GHSA)."" There are always those who use their phone while driving, but they should be punished for their recklessness.

There would always be a danger to driving and using a phone. The drivers that look at their phones now are already a danger. With the next generation starting to drive there would be an even bigger percentage of accidents. Those who choose to use the phone while driving should suffer the consequences.
