1F9026998271,"If my principal were to declare that all students were obligated to participate in an extracurricular activity, I would be less than pleased with the idea. I do not believe students should be made to do anything outside of the curriculum by their education system. The mere concept of this rule being enforced shows a lack of understanding or compassion from schools.

Now, please allow me to clarify- I believe that extracurricular activities are perfectly fine. Clubs like ""We the People"" are great for those who are interested in American history or writing, and playing sports is perfect for exercise, to no one's surprise. They are a wonderful way of expanding horizons, making friends and exploring new things. But that's exactly how they should remain:

extracurricular.

As in, outside of the required learning and entirely optional. Students should be free to choose whether they do or don't participate in activities outside of the standard school day. If a student's parents require him or her to do a club or sport, however, that is a very different case. Parents have a say in what their child does, and they have every right to decide if the student will participate in any type of organization. Schools do not and should not have the same level of involvement.

In addition to that, turning extracurricular activities into a mandatory affair is either a waste of student time or class time. Although making clubs compulsory perhaps sounded like a good idea, not only is it a bad one, it's a time-wasting one.

If every single student will do an extra activity, then by that logic, schools would just add an hour to the school day, which I know would not go over well with many. Besides, students already have significant amounts of homework from various classes. Adding another obligatory activity to dedicate time to could very well be too much. Making extracurricular activities mandatory is also just disrespectful to many family's schedules. Maybe a student had already been participating in a separate, unrelated activity or organization. It could be that the student has a religious practice after school, or he or she has to take care of a family member. The examples are endless. Nevertheless, schools should not take up student's time outside of school any more than they already do.

Even if that isn't the case, if the school system somehow managed to squeeze in enough time for an extracurricular activity for everybody without adding any time to the school day, it could potentially be wasteful of the teacher's already limited teaching time. If we only have 45 minutes per class right now, imagine how little it would be adding another period. Educators would be in a constant struggle to cram enough information in such a short class time. If this did happen, it could be very possible that the school year might be stretched out so students could properly learn the concepts, which would leave many students and teachers who love summer vacation with disappointing news.

To summarize, I firmly believe that making extracurricular activities compulsory for students is not a good idea. Those activities are meant to be optional, and if every student were to do them schools would have to monopolize everybody's personal time by extending the school day, drain the little instructional time teachers have by shortening their classes, or elongate the entire school year. While at first it may seem like a terrific idea, various cracks start to reveal themselves at second glance. In the end, I don't think the idea would have worked.    ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
DF890FC7D48F,"If every student were to participate is a after school activity or sport, then the school would keep getting better. If the principle were to make this rule then everyone wouldnt be as lazy. When the principle makes this rule happen, no one would be left out of anything, students would get better attitudes and grades, and students would respect the teachers and other students as well.

All students would be apart of something and will make friends eventually, therefore not one student would be sad about being left out which would boost their confidence more and more every day. Everyone gets to pick their sport or activity so that they will have fun doing it but still be working. They wouldnt have to participate in a sport or club that they dont want to but they would have to pick something. Everyone would have at least one friend because they have to work with each other all the time and they would learn to like each other. The whole school would be productive all the time and the schools systems would be improving every day.

The students would be focused on getting good grades because if they dont then they have to leave their club or team and pick a different team or club. Students would like what they do because they chose it and because they like it so much they will have better attitudes and behave better. Students wanna have good grades and be happy and this is the perfect way to make it happen. The more they experience in that club or team the happier the students are gonna be inside and outside of school. Some students are depressed and sad all the time so if we give those students people to hang out with and fun things to do we can wipe out all of the depression that those students have.

If the principle made this a rule than students would have more time to socialize with other students and their teachers. The more socializing that the students have with teachers the more the students will respect the teachers and have a better attitude in their class. If the students know and respect their teacher than they wont act up during class time and the class will be able to get more stuff done. If the students stop messing around in a teachers class than the teachers would respect them and the class could work hard to learn more everyday. The school would get better over time and soon the school will be active all the time.

Everyone would be doing something so that even the kids that dont want to do anything still have to. I agree with this principle in many ways and think he is absolutely amazing and his idea is a great one. If we all work together to get the whole school to be active than i think it would be possible and they would have a great school.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
C8C708EC29F7,"Why students should participate in extracurricular activities. You should consider doing a extracurricular activity. Because participating in at least one extracurricular activity can help you branch out, make new friends, and you can have access to Currier interests. These are very important because they can help you have a overall better experience at school. Many enjoy doing these activities and find it very relaxing to get away from school for a while and try something new.

Firstly, you can branch out and make new friends, when participating in extracurricular activities. When you are doing something you enjoy, you can find people with the same interests as yourself. Many people like myself love doing extracurricular actives. For example I love doing FFA, I've met so many great people along the way. This organization has taught me so much, such as life lessons, leadership skills, and team building strategies.

Secondly, this is a great way for students to interact with others. In addition they can participate in sports, working on the yearbook, and the debate team. Sports, is a great way for you to get the exercise you need, becoming more social with others, and being competitive with other teams. Working on the yearbook is a great way for students to take pictures, edit on computers, and take part in the making of the the yearbook. Finally the debate team, this club is for students who are very opinionated, strong willed, and are not afraid of public speaking. This club is great for students who enjoy arguing against others and communication well with other teams.

Thirdly, Currier pathways options, this is a bonus to participating in at least one extracurricular activity. You may decide to try something new and really enjoy it. In the future this could possibly be a Currier interest for you. For example if you choose yearbook, a Currier option for you could be photography. There are many options out there, but this one extracurricular activity you choose, could help you make that decision. On the other hand I would think about choosing one of these activities.

In conclusion, you should consider doing at least one extracurricular activity. You can branch out,interact with others, and have access to Currier interests. These activities can really make you more skilled at what you love to do. Therefore I encourage you to do at least one extracurricular activity.              ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
50BC2C5D78A9,"The principal has decided that all students must do an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities can be fun or can just give you something to do. However, I do not agree with this. The principal might have a good reason for doing this, but students should be able to do whatever classes they want to do and not do whatever they don't want to do, and some extracurricular activities could clog a busy student's life with unnecessary work.

Students should be able to choose whatever they want to do. Some might want to take extracurricular activities, and some might not want to. One of the most important things about work, school, or any type of job is that it doesn't matter what you're doing as long as you're happy doing it. Happiness has a large effect on anyone's life. It is very important that a student is happy with whatever they are doing, because if they do not like what class they are participating in, they might not want to do their work, which could lead to bad grades, which could lead to anxiety or depression. Then, they might not be able to focus on their other classes, and that means more bad grades. There are many other paths that not enjoying your work can go down, too.

Some children's lives could be very busy. Let's say that a child is living in a family that does not have much money, so they need to stay home and babysit their siblings. An extracurricular activity such as a sport can lead to the child not being home until even later that day, which means their parents have to stay home to watch their other children, meaning the parents can not work to make more money. This could lead to very difficult financial issues for the child's family. In fact, this happens too often in real life. This could happen in real life to a student at the school, and they might not even be able to afford school anymore.

The principal should most definitely consider their decision. Extracurricular activity can affect student's lives in many different ways, but some of effects can be not at all beneficial to a student. Unnecessary work can affect emotional, physical, and mental health in more ways than you can imagine. If students want to do an extracurricular activity, they can, and if they don't want to, they shouldn't have to. Not being able to make your own decision can not only affect what you want, but also what you need.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
C60689EE82FA,"Some people feel that extracurricular activities are not beneficial for children and teens.

I personally think that thet are very beneficial.

These are some reasons why and how they benefit.

You may not know this but 1 in every 3 kids are socially awkward.

Making kids join an after school activity that they enjoy with other kids that enjoy the same thing as them will help them bond with others and make friends.

This will also help with communication skills not only with adults but also with others.

If they dont make mistakes and ask questions about their mistakes than they will never learn.

Sports and extracurricular will also keep kids out of doing bad things.

Most sports are like a gateway of getting away from drugs and drinking underage.

Most sports teams have rules against posting pictures with red solo cups in them to keep the team and players safe.

Colleges look at everything from grades to community service hours.

Colleges also look for leaders at school and in the community.

If colleges see that someone has good grades and is a leader in not only their community but at school as well that will really be beneficial.

It is never too early to start applying and preparing for your future.

As we know our countries obesity rates are going up daily due to new technology like phones and how kids are on their phones way too much and they don't get nearly any exercise.

If kids dont learn how to put down the apple phones and pick up a real apple then before our eyes the country will jut get more and more oboes.

Extra sports will help kids to burn calories and fat in a fun and healthy way.

This is also a good source of exercise without having to go to the gym or having a gym membership.

As we know everyone has their own thoughts and opinions about certain issues and decisions and to conclude I would just like to say please take my essay into consideration when making this decision.

Thank you.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
9579947BE786,"How would you feel if you had to do an extracurricular activity even if you were already busy during the school week? Our principle has decided that it is mandatory for all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some kids might like the idea of playing a sport or joining yearbook club because they have a lot of free time or they like participating in extracurricular activities. But others might feel like they are already to busy after school with homework taking up their free time or they might want to use their free time to relax and reset themselves for the next day. If students were required to do at least one extracurricular activity then some students would not have time to do homework, students might not be passionate about participating in any of the extracurricular activities offered, and they would not be able to take a break from the stressful school atmosphere.

Extracurricular activities can take up a lot of time which means less time for students to do homework. Sports can be two to four hours long everyday after school making it so students are forced to do their homework late in the night when they really should be in bed asleep preparing their brains for the next day of work. Some extracurricular activities like band require students to participate in concerts which end late at night giving students no time to do their homework at all. Other kids might take longer to do homework because they like to take their time or they are struggling in their school subjects. If those students were forced to do an extracurricular activity their grades might drop dramatically because they don't have the amount of time they need to do their homework after school. If extracurricular activities were required then students would not have any time to do their homework.

Extracurricular activities are fun for some, but not for all. Some students might want to join the football team or organize pep rallies, but others might not to want to do anything school related that they don't have to do. Extracurricular's like yearbook club require a lot of focus and passion for the amount of effort it takes. I doubt that the person running an extracurricular activity would want a student participating in their club that doesn't want to put forth any effort in what they are doing. If students are not passionate about the extracurricular activity they are taking, then they are just wasting the time of the people that are actually putting effort into the activity. Students should not be required to take an extracurricular activity because it takes effort that some students are not willing to give.

Some students might feel that extracurricular activities relieve their stress and allow them to relax, but other students feel the complete opposite way. Extracurricular activities can cause stress by not giving students a break from the school atmosphere. Extracurricular's like art or even sports might seem like they can give students a break from school, but art and sports take up time for students to do individual activities during the week. Some students need breaks from the school atmosphere because it's packed, you have no time to yourself, and some of the students at school might not be very friendly to their fellow classmates. School atmospheres can be very stressful for some students and extracurricular activities would not give them the much needed break they need from it all.

Extracurricular activities may benefit others when it comes to participating in school activities, having fun, and filling up free time. Some students might like the idea of joining a sport or doing yearbook club. But some students may not want to participate in extracurricular activities, they may not think any of the activities are fun, and students just may not have the extra time to be able to participate in them. Some students don't think that joining a sport or yearbook club would be fun, or they just don't have the time. Extracurricular activities should be optional because students need to be able to have time for homework, students may not like any of the extracurricular's offered, and they need to be able to take a break from the school atmosphere.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
99CAD0AF3560,"Is playing a sport a fun activity for students? Does it help students exercise? Does it help students get healthier? I agree that playing a sport is a fun activity to all students for many reasons.

To begin with, playing a sport is a good way to be more energetic. Playing a sport can help students exercise. Students might do some warm up games, do some work outs or they can practice at home with their families. Playing a sport can also help students get healthier. Students get more energetic, eat healthy food, and get in good shape. Playing a sport can help students do better things. They could run faster, get stronger, and it can help them do better in class

On the other hand, playing a sport is bad for some students. Students might get sick for being outside. If is winter and students are playing outside all day they might get sick from the cold or if is spring they might get sick from pollution. Some students might get injured. Students might break their arms or legs for playing with others students that are bigger than them. Some students might not be good at sports. Students might suck at soccer, football, or basketball and they won't play.

Even though playing a sport is bad for some students, they can still play. Even though students get sick they can still play. If some students get sick they can get medicine and go back to play. Even though some students might get injured they can recover. Some students might break their legs or arms, they can wait a few weeks and go back to play. Even though some students might not be good at sports they can still learn. Some students might suck at soccer, football. or basketball with practice they can learn how to play.

In conclusion, playing a sport is fun because you play with your friends, run around, or just feel the wind in your face. It helps students exercise by doing some warm up games, work outs, or practice at home with their families. It helps students get healthier by eating healthy food and get in good shape.

3F8A01E216B1,"How would you feel if your principal said it is mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity? It could be anything like sports, you could work on the year book, or serve on the student council. Some of you may wonder if this would be a good idea or not to make it mandatory to participate in these activity. In my opinion, I think this would not be a great idea to make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. In this essay I will give specific details and examples why I think this wouldn't be a good idea.

One of my reasons why I think that making it mandatory to do an activity isn't a good idea is because of different peoples attitude. Some people may have a great reaction to knowing and some others may not even care because maybe they are in an extracurricular activity now. Others could have a negative reaction to it which could be a problem. A reason why this could be a problem is because if they act negatively to this,they could make it hard on the teacher giving them bad attitudes to the teacher make it a whole lot stressful for the teacher if the student doesn't want to be there.

Some people may think that this could be a good thing because it could maybe help students in different ways. Being in a extracurricular activity like Sports could maybe help people be more athletic then they already are. To those who want to be athletic being in something like sports could dramatically help them get what they want to accomplish. Being in a extracurricular activity like maybe some kind of math activity could help different people learn what they want or need to learn. Some people could just like it in general because they can do something they always wanted to and now have the chance to.

Lastly another reason why I think this wouldn't be a good idea is because of maybe cause of the parents. what would they do then if a parent of a child doesn't want there child to participate or don't want them to do a extracurricular activity? Then what would the principal do in these kind of problems? These are all things the principal would have to think about before making a decision to make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. Another thing you have to think about is if a student has a disorder or has some kind of sickness mentally or physically then what would the principal do?

These are all valuable reasons and things that play a big part in making a big decision like this. The principal has a lot of things to do/ think about before making a decision like this. I gave reasons why this could be a good thing but, I also gave reasoning on my opinion which is to not make this a mandatory thing. Ultimately I think this wouldn't be a good decision at all and this shouldn't be a mandatory thing.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
BB9EF9FA2F9B,"Students should have free time to get away from class for a while but some do not want to get away from class . So it is wrong that the principal is forcing this pressure on students to have to participate in at least one ""extracurricular activity"". Some students enjoy sports or student council and year book staff but some also enjoy spending time in class and paying attention and getting their work done. So you can't force them to participate in other stuff that they might not enjoy . So Why put pressure on them and say that they have to do this or do that ?? And what if there's not good options to pick from then that puts even more pressure on the student . There is no reason we should have to take at least one activity that liberty believes is benefiting the students when really all it's doing is putting stress on the students .

What if the options they have is not what the students are interested in. Because some are in to sports and you have to be good at that sport if you want to make the team. But then lets say the students does not make the team that leaves them with the other stuff they may not want to do, but it's not optional according to the principal we have to take some sort of extracurricular activity but some people arent good enough to do what they really enjoy so dont put un needed pressure on them .",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
A60ED461EEC9,"Should students participate in sports, work on year book, or serve on student council. Principal asked all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Is it a good or bad decision. I think it is a good decision for students to participate in a extracurricular activity because I can learn something new for participate, meet new people during the extracurricular activity, and have a good time.

First, if I want to learn something new can get in an activity I don't know how to do or play. Instead of wasting my time in something I already know, I can use it wisely to learn new things. Lets say I don't know how to play chest I can learn how to play that instead of playing other stuff I already know how to play. Its like playing a sport I know the rules to it but don't know how to play.

Secondly, most of the people at school I don't even know. Maybe by joining other extracurricular activity I can meet new people. This reminds me when I was in a new school. The only way to meet new people is to go up to them and talk to them. Now I can just play with them and get to know what they like and other stuff. Some people are really loud,smelly,and even play good at soccer like me something I am in to. Some people are like cheats running to the ball. A lot of people are different at my other school,but in this school people are lovely to others and are kindly to me and everyone. That is how I meet new people.

Last, the last thing people should do is have fun. Enjoy while it last because it could only last a week or two. You see having fun is not only with friends it is how you have fun. It has to be something all of my friends like not just what I like. Something we can all enjoy.

I think adding the extracurricular activity is a great decision to add at school people would enjoy having it. Students will learn something new, meet new people,and have a good time. Should every school have a extracurricular activity.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
E640BAE6092D,"When you join an extracurricular activity there's no telling what you can do! You could pass that test,win the football game or you could even make a new friend. Yes, the possibilities are endless when you join an extracurricular activity. But some people think that extracurricular activities are just a waste of time and that they don't really matter in the life.

But I think extracurricular activities contains many benefits to the typical school student. Such as, fitting in better at school,making new friends,and even improving your grades.

When you're in an after school club you'll fit in better by joining the club that best suits you. You can do what you enjoy best while even meeting new students and getting to know them as well. Meeting people that share the same interests as you, will most definitely help you fit in the school. Being the new student in school is scary and stressful. But if you join an after school club then you will definitely fit in better at the school.

Joining an after school club is a great way to be with your friends more and make new friends at the same time. School doesn't have to be the limit when it comes to being with your friends. And when you both join the same club you could spend more time together while doing your favorite things. Such as, being in the same team in a sport or acting in the theater. You and your friend could make new friends and hang out as a group.

If fitting isn't an issue then maybe your grades are. Joining in after school activities could improve your grades on certain subjects that you're struggling on.

Joining in these clubs could significantly improve your grades and help you better understand the subject. And if you do understand the subject then maybe you could help the other students that could still have trouble understanding. Not only would your grades improve but everybody else's that got your help.

In conclusion, I think everybody should join an extracurricular activities since it has many benefits to the average student. Participating in these activities could help you fit in better at school by being part of a group in a school like being in the chess club or football team. Being in these activities could also give you the opportunities to make new friends by meeting new people that share the same interests as you do. Joining these clubs could also give you the chance to bring your grades up and help you pass that test.

10E1C7EDACB8,"Firstly, I disagree because some kids around here may not have the money to do a sport, when you do a sport you have to buy the pants,shoes,the shirt everything that goes with that sport you'll need to buy for the activity or sport. But I do recommend trying to find something to do out of school so your not In your house all day long,but do something that you don't have to pay for, for example help out with a church group or ask people to walk there dogs stuff like that. Anyways i disagree most families out here in the real world don't have much money to spend money on everything your going to need for that activity that your going to do,now if you talk to the school or a teacher an tell them that you really would like to try this sport or this activity maybe they'll help you out with paying for the things but most of the time schools aren't very good with helping you with things like that.

Secondly, some kids may have to watch there brother or sister because there parents have to work or just maybe they only have one mom or just one dad. We never know what might happen if we leave them at their house by themselves. For example one time when I use to live In this big white house when I was younger my mom left to go work so I decide to go to a friends place that wasn't very far from my house so I left them there by themselves,my friend decide to pull up a stop sign but I wasn't involved someone saw her do it an called the cops on us,next thing you know the cops was there then I got in trouble because I've left my brother and sister at home with no one there to watch them. So thats why students should have a choice to not do a sport or a activity, so they don't have to leave their siblings at there house by themselves.

finally, most kids like sports and doing fun activities but I've known some kids and people that don't like to do sports or fun activities. The reason Is I've seen kids get Into big fights over who's going to go first an this an that,thats part of the reason some kids don't get out much to do things but the other reason Is maybe they feel like they'll get judge by what they look like or how they dress trust me i understand that problem. The other thing is sometimes kids have to get a job to help pay bills and get food on the table because there mother Isn't making much money so they have to go get a job and help there mother with stuff they need. People all around the world have to do these things It's sad that they have to but they got to do what they have to do.

324FCF9DA47C,"Imagine, going to a school where everyone was sad, and there were not any activities to do. It doesn't sound very nice. Well, this is what is going to happen if students do not participate in an extracurricular activity. For example, you could join a sport, work on the yearbook, serve on the student council, and many more. There is something for everyone, so don't be afraid to try new things. Students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity, because it makes them happier and healthier, keeps them involved in their school, and is a chance to make new friends.

Studies show that 95% of people that join an after school activity are happier and healthier than those that don't. My brother, Generic_Name, became happier and healthier after joining a sport. Not only did he stay in shape, but his mental health improved tremendously. This all happened because he decided to try out for football. Most people are too afraid to try something new, so they won't. That is why if they are required to join something or try out they might find something that they are really good at. So, next time you are too scared to do something just remember that you won't know until you try.

Next, participating in an extracurricular activity makes for a more involved student body. When, you play a sport or join a club you are showing some school spirit. School spirit makes school fun and enjoyable for both staff and students. When, school is fun you are more likely to join another club or sport, which improves your school spirit more. It is just a big chain reaction and the result is an involved student body. To start the chain reaction you have to make it a requirement to join an extracurricular activity. Yes, the students might be hesitant at first, but they'll love coming to school and participating in things in the end. These things will also improve grades, so the students will be involved and they will improve academically. All of these things make for a more involved student body.

Finally, nine times out of ten people meet their lifelong friends through after school activities. Generic_Name, my sister, participated in several things; including, cheer leading, tennis, FCCLA, production, and track. She met all of her friends through extracurricular activities. Even though, she is almost out of college now, she is still friends with all of them. By putting herself out there she has made friends that she'll keep forever. This also goes back to before, Participating in a sport makes you healthy and happy. Generic_Name became happier, healthier, and involved. Now it is your turn, so will you?

I believe that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because it makes them happier and healthier, keeps them involved, and is a chance to make new friends. Students may want to play a sport, but they can't because they are not enough people. Or, a classmate wants to try out but they feel as though they aren't good enough. We need to encourage students to participate in something greater than themselves. By making it a requirement to participate in something, they will not be as scared to do it.

Extracurricular activities help you make friends, learn helpful skills in life, discover your passion, and make the school community better. I agree with the principals decision, every student should participate in extracurricular activities. I believe once given a chance, every student will find and love a certain extracurricular activity that speaks to them.

Extracurricular activities are a great way to meet new people, and make friends. When you join an extracurricular activity you meet new people who share the same interest as you. If you're socially awkward or shy extracurricular activities may seem like your worst nightmare. Fortunately, your shared interest will give you something to talk about with your peers that are there, and chances are, you're not the only new person participating. Making new friends can give you someone to talk to, they can make you smile more, and make your day better. Maybe you meet your friends that stay with you for the rest of your life during that activity, if you never try it, you'll never know.

Going to extracurricular activities can also teach you helpful skills in life. There are many different types of extracurricular activities, some you do only for fun, some you do to help your community, and some you do to learn new skills. If you've always thought about trying a certain activity, but you're not sure if you'll like it, extracurricular activities are a great way to go! There are so many different activities that you could try, many of them help you gain skills you'll use later in life. As an example I took Tech Ed, I was wary about it at first, but I had so much fun, and I learned many useful tools in life. I also took Home EC. which taught me how to cook and sew. I learned so much from both classes, and learned many skills from both of them that I will use later in life.

Participating in extracurricular activities can also help you discover your passion. Trying something new can be scary at first, but chances are, you'll find something you like. People discover their passion by trying new things. As your extracurricular activity you may choose to take Tech Ed. You find out that you really like seeing how things are put together, and building things, so you decide to become an engineer or architect when your older. If you never tried Tech Ed you never would have known that you want to become an engineer, and you would have never discovered your love for building things. By participating in new things you have the chance to discover your passion, what you want to do for the rest of your life.

Participating in extracurricular activities not only helps you, but also the school you go to, and your community. Every activity you do helps the school community in someway, so you're not only helping yourself, you're also helping the school community become better. Whether you're picking up trash, tutoring younger students, or you're part of the school basketball team, they all help the school become better. By helping the school, you are ensuring that your legacy lives on, you are ensuring that your school community is the best it can be, for you, for your friends, and for those that come after you.

I agree with the principals decision that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students gain so much from participating in extracurricular activities. They make new friends, learn skills that they will use later in life, discover their passion, and make their community a better place. I want to make every students middle and high school years the best that they can be. By participating in extracurricular activities, I believe they will be one step closer to achieving that.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
9B0FE1456518,"Students should participate in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are helpful in many different ways. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you get time to socialize, have fun, and do something productive.

One reason you should participate in extracurricular activities is because you get the time to socialize with others. Knowing that you will be doing this activity for a while, it becomes easier to talk to other students. When I know that I am doing an activity that I will enjoy, it becomes easier for me to talk to other students and open up a bit. Socializing with people also helps you feel a bit lighter. When there is something that is annoying me I tell a friend or a teacher that I trust and who better than those friends who are doing the same extracurricular activity as you. Your friends are usually doing the same extracurricular activity as you and that helps because you can work and talk with your friends at the same time. Last year many of my friends participated in the same extracurricular activity as me and this year again many of of many friends are doing the same extracurricular activity as me. These are some of the ways that participating in a extracurricular activity can help with your socializing abilities with others.

Another reason you should participate in extracurricular activities is because extracurricular activities are really fun. Usually the extracurricular activity you take is the one that you like, so you have a lot of fun in it. The extracurricular activity I am taking is art and I love that class. Most of the time whatever extracurricular activity you are in your friends are in it to, if not then you make friends and you end up having a lot of fun in that class. In art I have many friends and I enjoy the class a lot. During extracurricular activities you can relax and fool around a bit. Extracurricular activities are my favorite because I can relax, have fun, and let out any stress from the day. These are some of the ways you can have fun in a extracurricular activity.

Many people believe that students shouldn't participate in extracurricular activities. They think that extracurricular activities aren't productive, and they are a waste of time. Extracurricular activities have helped people in many different ways. People only take extracurricular activities because they think extracurricular activities are productive and they can help them out in school too. I participate in extracurricular activities because I think they are important, productive, and can help me in many different ways. Extracurricular activities help relax a students mind. Extracurricular activities have helped me relax and open my mind so that I can do good in school in every possible way. These are the reasons that I think that extracurricular activities are productive and important.

Students should be involved in at least one extracurricular activity. During extracurricular activities students can talk to other students, enjoy their time in that activity, and do something productive.

47355D7141C0,"Extracurricular activities is one of the most underrated parts about school. I believe we should all participate in at least one extracurricular activities. These activities helps the students more then you think. Extracurricular activities helps the person build character. It also gives the students opportunity in life and helps them gain experience, meet new people. That can also get help for homework and school.

Extracurricular activities such as sports helps the student build there character. In sports the student works in a team and listen to the coaches instructions. By letting other people finish their sentences and listening to them. That helps them become a better listener. In sports and in other clubs the student is held accountable for there actions. By knowing the the students actions have consequences and there team depends on them. That helps the student to work hard not to make any excuses. In sports the students have to help their team mates. In a activity if the students team mates needs help on any thing. The student should help them, by helping other people the students builds a strong character.

Students can join new groups and teams and learn new skills, such as cooking cleaning and more. With those experiences it might help them get a job in future. It would look really good on a students job a placation form. If a student wants to become a chef we should have a cooking club. In this club the students learn how to make food and drinks. So when the student wants to become a chef, he already knows the basics before every one else. Also in the group the students can learn how to manage there time under pressure. This is a very important experience that should know. This can help the students on other jobs.

If students are having trouble in school. We should make a group or club where students can get help, from other students on school work, projects and quizzes. With this group the students grades can improve. That might get to know some new test taking skills. Also in this group students are able to talk to new friends and make new friends. Their also able to work on each other weakness and help it become stronger.

Thats why I think we should all participate in at least one extracurricular activities. These groups helps us make new friend, learn new experiences and help us build our character. Some of these groups can also be turned into classes.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
95C7CAC2FB6D,"Ever heard of Bill Nye the Science Guy? If you have, please ""Consider the Following"". School doesn't give many people vibes of achievement, goals, or learning. In fact, school is a pretty stressful time for young people and their peers. I've known students who haven't slept in a week and yet still show up for school. With the chaos that might erupt during the hours of education, adding more would not be ideal. Extracurricular activities can be important and fun for some students, yes, but we have to consider every possible situation that could prevent some students from being able to. Students have their own lives out of the seven hours, and adding more could be something that they are not able to keep up with, that could affect their mental health, or could damage future opportunities.

Students already have work they are given to do after school, and they have responsibilities they have to keep up with when they come home. So homework aside, they could still have a lot to do at home. Parents could be working and they have to tend to their younger siblings. They take shifts at a local Starbucks to earn money so they can help with the bills. Or if they're in America, they could be saving up to pay for college applications. They possibly just come home and relax because they had a big exam and are absolutely drained of any and all energy. Whatever the situation is, after school activities could interfere with their personal and/or outside life. And if the extracurricular is during school or on weekends, that's just more valuable time taken from them that could be used for something else. And that could drain them of energy even more. There could be billions of reasons why they just cannot keep up, and we must take that into consideration.

One of the reasons they might not be able to keep up is because life might be bringing them down. Many students across the globe are so sickeningly stressed, and they aren't even two decades into their life. Adults still have dreams about school and get stressed out about them when they are awake, even if they have graduated years ago. And did you know the average high school student has the same anxiety levels as a 1950's psychiatric patient? While the world has developed from the 1950's, that does not make these facts any less terrifying. And adding more can do something to their mental state of mind. Picture it: a stereotypical basketball player, playing after school 'til six. Suddenly everyone's cheering for them, and the pressure gets to them as they struggle to keep grades up, get good scores on exams, get scholarships, and take care of everything. They become tense and irritable and they don't find time to breathe. Forcing extracurricular activities on top of students while already piling homework and tests and competitions, it is bound to make them break. In fact, forcing even things they like can make them lose their interests. If you force them to do something everyday, they will find that it is probably just for the grade instead of the experience, and they could quickly lose interest in something that they adored before.

All this loss of interest can also play a part in damaging the future. Remember when we talked about saving money for college? If they can't earn enough to apply, that's one missed opportunity right there. They could have been the world's next Einstein and we wouldn't ever know. Or because of working after school on the yearbook committee they miss a party that could have been the best night of their life. A memory that could have stuck with them was erased as soon as they signed up for the student council. We will never know how the future plans out but we have to let the students decide for themselves about that. They need to experience what they choose and when they choose to live it.

So as you can see, everyone lives in their own time and their own place and comfort zone. You can't force things on students forever. If it ever comes to go big or go home, when in student's doubt, just let them decide what works for them. Because these extracurricular activities are not always beneficial to the student.

If you enforce them with knowing everything, it effects their mental being, and can affect their lives outside of school and their future as well.                          ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
1DC6485ABFF6,"Do you participate in any after school activities? Well if you don't now you have to, my principal if making it mandatory to participate in at least one after school activity. You can participate in many activities such as sports teams, student council, and the debate team. There are many points for why this shouldn't be a rule in school. Some points are time management, interest, and funds/workers.

My first point is about time management, if students are doing extra activities they might not have time to do other important things. One of these important things is homework, if there doing activities they don't have time to do the homework a teacher assigned. This would lead the student to be behind in there classwork and cause there grade to drop. The second important thing they wouldn't have time to do is there chores. A lot of kid have chores and if there not done there parents will not be happy. This leading to the kid getting in trouble and getting a punishment.

My second point is interest, if there is no activities that interest the student there not going to have fun. And if they are not having fun they will slack off and not try there best. If a student doesn't want to do a activity that may cause them to make there own fun and act out and get into trouble. Then there parents would be angry and they would get in more trouble and the teachers would be angry because if the kid got Saturday school the teacher have to come watch them. Plus if they get in trouble that will mess with there record.

My third point is funds and workers, if you have more activities you need more money and more people to work them. And the school would have to ask the county for more money and the county might not have that amount of fund for the school. And you have to find the people to work those activities witch may be hard to do. And the schools may not be big enough for the activities to all be housed there. And that means they might have to rent a space for a activity to be held and that cost more money.

That is my three points on why I thing it would not be a good idea to make it mandatory for every student to participate in a after school activity. I already participate in a after school activity but I hope it is never mandatory. It would not achieve what school want witch is to keep kids active. It would only make the problem get worse and wouldn't fix it at all. The three points are funds/workers, interest, and time management. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
6E050DCAB4E6,"In the Declaration of Independance, it is written that all men have certain rights, including the rights to ""life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness.""

If students were forced to participate in an extracurricular activity, two of those three rights would be taken away, at least for an afternoon or so.

Over the next three paragraphs, I will list the negatives of forcing students to do extracurricular activities, including that it takes away students freedom, they might not want to do it, and it could take away valuable time.

My first point is that it takes away freedom of the students.

People should be able to choose whether they want to do something.

If someone wanted to play soccer, but then the school was like ""NO! You have to be on the student council instead!"", then the school would be taking away their freedom to choose.

They also might not have enough time to do it.

If they already have a full schedule, then what?

Does the school force them to take something out?

And how do they enforce it?

If someone doesn't want to do an extracurricular activity, and realizes that forcing kids to do it is stupid, then how will the school make them?

They can't punish them.

It doesn't add up.

Students should be able to decide whether they do something like this or not, because America is built on freedom, and schools can't take that away.

Furthermore, the students might not want to do it.

If they wanted to play a sport, there is only limited slots on a team.

If they fail to make the team, then what?

Are they just told to pick another activity?

And also, the school might not offer what a student wants.

If a student loved anime and wanted a club, but there wasn't one, then don't force them to do something they don't want to do.

If they do force kids to do it, they should at least ask them what they would like to do, and if they don't have that, then create it.

And if they do force them to do something they don't like, someone could add a bad review on google.

Then, parents might decide they don't want their kids going to school there.

And if enough kids transfer, then the school might get shut down because they have no purpose to keep running.

Finally, it takes away valuable time.

Like I said in the first body paragraph, if they don't have enough time to do it, then what will the school do?

They can't force them to free up time, so the system is quite flawed.

Also, if a student has a pretty full schedule, and only has 1 free day, the school might take that away.

A couple of days in the week is fine to have things to do, but if you have something every single day, and only one day in a week that you are free, that is a valuable day.

Students need some days to unwind.

Plus, what if you had a lot of homework?

A conversation might go down like this:

The teacher said ""Hey Richard, did you do your essay?

I didn't ever get it from you.""

And then Richard said ""No, I'm sorry, but I wasn't able to finish it.

Since the principal is making us do these extracurricular activities, I had to do a club, and I wasn't able to study for my massive quarter test in algebra and do my essay last night.

I will try to get it to you today.""

That would be horrible for students, and could result in lower grades.

Students should not be forced to do extracurricular activities.

It takes away freedom from them, they may not want to do it, and it could take away valuable time, too.

I think that every person should be given a choice in what they do, and school or parents or whomever should not be allowed to choose for them.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
99A1DE3CF37F,"Students are going home everyday having nothing to do, therefore some of them turn to hang out with the wrong crowd, with the wrong people. Some turn to drugs, while others turn to alcohol. If only they had something to do after school, then they wouldn't do things like drugs and alcohol. That is why every student must participate in an extracurricular activity. While every student should do an extracurricular activity, the school has to provide multiple after school activities so that students have options to pick from. All students should participate in extracurricular activities because it gives students the feel of school pride when their school goes into a competition, it takes up time in a students day so they don't have to go do drugs and alcohol, and it surrounds a students with a good environment.

When students are involved in school, they participate in more school events like football games, school parties, and theater productions. Not only are the students more involved, but their friends are too. Most kids don't like to go to school events by themselves, so they bring a friend. If every student brings at least one friend, then the amount of people that goes to the events doubles. Just last year I was on my middle school basketball team and we were playing a team that we were rivals with. I wanted my friends to see and watch me play, so I brought at least twenty people to the game. When people are involved in something, they want their friends to see what they have done, and they want to be praised. The students may not enjoy being forced to stay after school at first, but they will soon learn to love it.

Some students go home to an empty house, for their parents come home late at night because they are working. With nothing to do they start to watch shows and movies, but they get bored and tired of watching TV shows after a while. When somebody is bored, they look for anything to cure their boredom. Some turn to friends, while others turn to drugs and alcohol. If they drink enough, they get drunk and do things without knowing they did it. This kills time a lot faster than sitting around doing nothing all day. Drugs can be worse because the consequences can be a lot more serious. Some consequences are liver failure and death. Both are also very expensive and addictive, so it makes the people taking it want to take one more dose, drink one more cup, until they no longer have any money because they spent it all on drugs and alcohol. Their school could have prevented all of this if the student just stayed after school for a little longer. If the students stayed after school for the yearbook committee, they would not have the time to be bored because they would be too busy creating a yearbook for the whole school to see. When students stay after school for extracurricular activities they do not need to turn to drugs because they are busy at school. The school also fills the students with a good environment, which leads me to my next topic.

A child acts and does things similar to the people they hang out with. If their friends are people that do a lot of community services and are nice people, the child will turn out to be nice too. This does not just apply to children, but it applies to everybody. Sometimes a good environment can be hard to find, but what better place sets a good environment than a school. A school has teachers that are willing to support their students and give them good guidance. Whenever I have a question with friends or anything, I have this one teacher that I know I can trust. This teacher helps and guides me with whatever my problem is. Everybody can find that one teacher they can trust if they joined an extracurricular activity. They could bond and connect with the teacher that is helping out at the activity, and they could find a good influence similar to the one I have.

Participating in an extracurricular activity helps and benefits students in many ways, and when students are ever looking for something to do, they don't have to turn to drugs, they could turn to after school activities which gives them a good and positive learning environment and it gives students the urge to participate and attend school games and parties. School may not be a students favorite place to be, but it provides students with a safe place that can have fun activities like soccer club or basketball club. Some students might complain about the new policy, but once they change their mindset, they will learn to love and enjoy the new rule. Not only are they staying in a safe environment, they are also hanging out with their friends outside of school hours. This time would also be a great time for students with no friends to take a chance and try to make some. Since extracurricular activities are fun and it provides a good and safe environment, making it mandatory it something I agree with and I think is right.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
5AEDB0F22B98,"I disagree with the principle on this decision, to make every student do an extracurricular activity because of three main points, the first being a student may have an activity that doesn't count as an extracurricular activity and adding the extracurricular activity would interfere with their schedules, the second point is students have lots of homework already. It may already be hard to keep up with school work for some students, and adding more work for them to do may make their grade drop and may add more stress to their lives. The third and finial point I'm going to make is, if you force students into extracurricular activities that they may not enjoy doing the amount effort they would put in will be low.

To elaborate on my first point, lets imagine you are a student and you had to go to school, then head to a job for a few hours then back to your house where you have to make dinner for you're whole family. After dinner you start your homework, every weekday that is your schedule. Then the principle make you start a extracurricular activity which mess up your whole schedule adding more stress and more things you need to do into your life.

Adding to my second point, If a student is already struggling in school and already has lots of stress to deal with. Then making the student add an extra curricular activity may not be the best course of action because it will only add extra stress to their lives. This may make their grades drop which will only add more stress to their already extremely stressful lives.

The final point is, if we force students to get an extracurricular activities that they didn't want to do. They would get bored of those extracurricular activities, and since we are forcing them to do those activities they will just lower the amount of effort they put into those activities, and making the school look like it bad because the students would have poor work.

Instead of forcing students into extracurricular activities, a better solution would be to encourage students to join in on some extracurricular activities. Then let them choose if they want to join any extracurricular activities on their own, because if we force all students to do extracurricular activities no matter what no one will benefit. I believe that if we let them choose if they want to join in extracurricular actives. They will be more inspired and will produce better work overall.

In collusion, I disagree with the principle on his decision, and believe that we should encourage students to join not just to forcing them into a extracurricular activity, because students will we more inspired to do the work and produce better work if they got to choose, than if they didn't get to choose.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

They could make new friends or be with there friends, by group activiyes.

A plus is that students will get off there phones and find somthing they would like to do. Another reason is the partents wont have to forces or make them do something they don't want to do in order to get them out.

DE728DF42B4C,"Principals are like the alphas in a school. Everything the principal says, you have to do. My principal decided for every student at the school to be in a activity, or in other words, a club. I agree with this offer because it can give kids opportunities, help them try something new, and be able to fit in a group or student body.

Doing fun things is awesome right? i dont know anybody who likes to stay home and do nothing all day. There are many opportunities out in the world but the principal is trying to bring in even more. Things that you like to do can be in a activity the school has. The activities can probably have big offers. For example, an art club. An Art Club is very artistic. The club draws, paints, and learns different things you've never known about art. The teacher says, one day, that there will be a competition for the best drawing. The competition can help you get better and learn new things. What artist doesn't want to have that big opertunitie? Not only does art have opportunities but other activities do too. For example the student council. the student council helps with fun raising and school activities. If you ever wanted to be in charge of something, you could sign up! that could be a great opertunitie for you.

Learning and trying things is cool right? Sometimes, you can get tired of what you like and what your doing, so you move on to the thing you were into before, to another. Trying new things can help you learn how to do things you havn't even tried. For example, in the movie ""High School Musical"", a boy named Generic_Name loves basketball. He is the team captain and everyone knows who he is. Everyday he practices and gets tired of shooting the same ball into a the same hoop. He goes to school the next day and see's a play is having try outs. Though he has never sang before, He wants to try and see if hes good at it. Doing different things that you normally do is perfectly fine. Not everyone likes the same thing all the time. Learning new things can get you to try even more new things. I've tried it before as well. For example, a girl named Generic_Name is a dancer and wants to take a break from it. Her feet hurt and she thinks she can pull of something else. Her school has many activities and she tries out for the soccer team. Never be afraid to do knew things.

Not everyone is in a certain group or activity. there are students in the world who think they dont fit in and have low self esteem. This offer from the principal can help you fit in a group. These activities can help you make new friends. Making new friends is amazing and you can be proud to say your in a group and have many friends. For example, A girl named Generic_Name is quiet at school. She always has her head down when she walks in the hallways. she never smiles nor talks. one day, the principal gives an announcement about every student being in at least one activity or club. She first say she doesn't want to do it, but tries anyways. In the club she picked, she meets new people and feels happy to be apart of something. this offer can bring you smiles to your faces everyday, Though these activities might not be everyday, you can say proudly and loudly, that you feel like you fit in. Another example is that a boy named Generic_Name has multiple friends. one day his friends leave him and he feels alone. He doesnt think he fits in. he feels like he doesnt want to go to school anymore. when he goes to school, he sees all of the activities that are on a big board. he signs up for a musical and meets new friends. fitting in is a good thing. These activities can help you with so much

Principals are helping everywhere around the world. they try there best to make learning fun and create new things like clubs and activities. the principal says every student needs to be in at least one club or activity. though some students dont agree, I do. What the principal is offering is valuable because it can give kids new opportunities in what they like and they can do things they have never done before. It can also help you fit in to a place that you think you wont be able too. every principal is very hard working and i think with this offer, it will bring students together and smiles on all of the students faces.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
0FD27A7C4257,"If the principal of my school decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I would be happy. I would be happy because there are many benefits to doing an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities can make you better at different things and they are often fun. They also give you a break from the regular school day to do something you enjoy. I totally agree with my principal's decision.

If you chose to do a sport it would be good for your body. You would get your daily exercise in while doing something fun. Doing a sport would also make you a better communaciater. If you do a sport you have to work with your team. They have to understand what you need and you have to understand what they need. To do that you have to talk to each other.

There are many extracurricular activities to choose from. If you don't yet know what you enjoy, this would be a perfect opportunity to explore new activities. You could try new things and see what you like. This would also make it easier to choose a future career. If you know what you enjoy then you can narrow down your job choices.

Extracurricular activities give kids a break from the regular school day to do something they enjoy. This hour of ""fun time"" might give some kids a reason to like school. You would look forward to this class because you enjoy it.

These activities can also build relationships. You could make new friends in your extracurricular class because you all like the same thing.

In conclusion I think it is a great idea to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities expand your horizons and make you better at the things you like. They are fun and encourage students to try new things. You can explore the plethora of activities and find one you like.

0FE3B7AAD133,"There are millions of schools across America. Many schools offer extracurricular activities after, before, and during school. I believe that extracurricular activities are a great way to become more social and outgoing within your community, but I don't think it should be forced upon either. Yes, you may have those kids who would love to socialize more, but you also need to look at the bigger picture. Millions of children get bullied everyday for anything, clothes, appearance, religion, etc. I have come to terms with the fact that you can't change people, but you can prevent unspeakable situations from happening. I disagree with forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities because they may get over worked, have a higher chance of bullying, and lose personal time.

From a students perspective, another extracurricular activity may be enjoying, others may not agree. As stated, three of these possible activities are student council, sports, and working on the yearbook. The possibility of getting over worked is very high. If a child thought they could be on the student council, but realized it was to much for them, what would happen? Could they just leave the council or would they have to go through with it? What if they didn't say anything at all because they we're too embarrassed? Children already have to go with so much already believe it or not. Kids already have homework, projects, tests, etc. Then to add another chip on their shoulder, kids could become very stressed with their activity.

Bullying has been very big problem these past couple of years. Lots of it has to do with social media. Still, many kids get bullied in school. Based on how they look, how they dress, what they bring to eat, religion, and more. That could happen so much easier when you add another extracurricular activity. For example, lets say a student chose to do sports, and this student wears a hijab as part of her religion. Everyday she's told to take it off or is called slurs by other classmates in her activity class that she has never met before. It's the same people every day, she just shrugs it off. She then finally says something to a teacher. They finally get suspended for how many days, and are kicked out of the sport class. Everything is fine now, right? Wrong, she will always remember what they said to her, and it could've been prevented if they didn't force an extra class.

Many kids have their own out of school activities. A child may get caught up in both of their activities. For example, lets say that a student has to go to school for their activity, but they also have soccer practice. If they go to practice then they miss the in school activity, and if they go to school then they miss their practice. Both are very important to the student, but they need to choose. They shouldn't have to choose, and then be stressed about the other decision.

Adding another extracurricular activity may make a student over worked, have a higher chance of bullying, and lose personal time. I think that if you want to do an extracurricular activity you can, and if you don't want to you dont have to. If you did do another activity what would the end goal be for that. Would it be to make kids social? Would it make kids try and trust each other? Maybe, forcing children to communicate with one another isn't the best choice?              ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

Participating in extracurricular activities at school is very enjoyable and gives people something to do. There is a wide variety of activities that are available to participate in at school like playing sports, working on the yearbook, and being apart of the student council. Although many choices are available, that does not mean everyone is required to be apart of a club or organization at school. It should not be mandatory to do school activities because people may do other activities outside of school, not be interested in taking part in school activities, or have no time and money to be apart of a school group. An important part of being a student and a teenager is making their own decisions by picking what they like and don't like. Middle School and High School students are more independent and responsible, so they make their own choices on what activities to partake in.

Firstly, a majority of students participate in other activities outside of school. Sports are the most common things for students to do in their free time. Playing school sports should not be mandatory because students who play travel sports or any type of sport outside of school already have to deal with complicated schedules and practice times. It's not just sports that take up so much time though; students have to do homework, study, make time to hang out with friends, and have hobbies that they find fun and relaxing. If students do activities outside of school like playing sports or writing stories, they might not care to play sports or be in a writing club for the school because they already do those things outside of school on their own time.

Secondly, some students do not want to do any activities. Not everyone has to do something if they don't want to, because participating in educational activities at school is something that should be optional and not required for all students. Playing sports, working on the yearbook, or being apart of a student council does not appeal to every single student at a High School or Middle School. Even if a student is interested in art and painting, that particular individual does not have to be in an Art Club at school unless they choose to be. It is always good to have an average amount of members in each club so all clubs are equal and can represent the school by the activities they take part in. But, by creating a rule that students have to be in at least one club, students may join random clubs just to abide by the rules, even though they show no particular passion or liking of their club of choice. When this happens, nobody will actually care for the activity they chose because they would've been forced to be apart of it, which takes away the fun.

Lastly,

Students may not have enough time or money to be involved in school sports, yearbook club, or a student council. Activities like sports or organized clubs can have practices, games, or meetings daily. More Specifically, sports gear costs a large amount of money and needs to be replaced once in a while. Transportation could also be an issue for getting to and from the school or places that students hold games or meetings. If a student tries to balance a school activity, something outside of school, and homework, they could become stressed and not perform as well in those three activities. Overall, the decision of whether or not a student participates in extracurricular activities should be decided by each individual student themselves, because everyone is different and knows how many activities they can handle at a time.

In conclusion, I disagree with the principals' decision to force all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity on school grounds. The principal should just highly encourage students to participate in things like sports, clubs, and organizations instead of creating a rule about them. A lot of different kinds of people go to school,and not everybody shares a common interest. Whether it be Middle School or High School, there is not going to be a club or extra curricular activity for everyone to be themselves and thrive with their peers. It should not be mandatory for students to be apart of extracurricular activities at school because of students having hobbies outside of school, not be interested in doing these activities, or they have don't have time and money to join a school group. So, instead of forcing all students at school to be involved, create more options for all different types of people to join. This whole problem can be solved by posting fliers or making announcements about upcoming events or new clubs. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

Do you think every body should do a extra curricular activity? Most people do activities but the school does not run them. A lot of schools dont even host good our a lot of programs. Most activities do not fit every body. After school things separate more time away from peoples family.

If someone makes the team for a sport over a kid who wants it more then that person. The student that made it gets forced to do something he docent want to do, and ruins opportunities for other kids. Students should not have to do a extra activity kid who want's it, freedom, and passionate.

Kids who really want's something might not be able to achieve there goal. They put in extra work and grinding for along time. Some kids might just be there to say they are on a team or program. If every one had to do one extra activity things would get packed. They have been trying there best for a lot of years and just join something for free.

People love to have freedom they like to go home play with there dog our younger siblings. next there some kids that like play video games and make money from that. Forcing kids do an activity might make sad if they get joked cause they do something wrong. Not every body parents or guardians can come pick the up after school. Theres a lot of kids out there like to do activities by them selves because it helps them focus.

Finally kids are passionate about there own activities. Having to do another activity can make some students irritated. Students are already at school for seven plus hours. Kids should follow there dreams stick to it and make new things happen.

Students would like to pro sue there own path.

At last this is why having extracurricular activities is not he brightest idea. Hope that this will put an idea principle thought. Having to do extra activity when just make the day if longer. They want to go home and live there life how they want to. Students should not have to do a extra activity kid who want's it, freedom, and passionate.                                ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
FAEF1DFCF68E,"H: Have you ever had to balance school work, homework, a job, and multiple after school activities? If so then were you able to do it well? I think students having a mandatory extracurricular activity is a terrible idea, I think this because some students may have jobs after school, some may have to help their families, and some would have to do multiple activities.

The first reason I think this is a terrible idea is because some students have a job after school. I have a friend that is trying to get a job and he would probably work everyday after school. When he gets home after school he world only have a few hours to get his homework done and get ready for work, since he would probably go straight to sleep when he got home after work and not have time to do his homework. If he also had an after school activity then he would have even less time to do his homework and get ready for his job. He would also be even more tired when he got home because he didn't have the few hours he would normally have to get some rest before he had to get ready.

The second reason I think this is a terrible idea is because some students may have to help their families after school. Some students when they get home after school don't have a parent home to take care of their siblings so they would have to do it. They have to make food and make sure their siblings do what they are suppose to do be doing. If they had to have an extracurricular activity then they would get home later than their siblings. Their siblings would have time to do whatever they wanted before anyone got home. Then when they got home they would have to get their sibling back to what they are suppose to be doing. After that they would have to make food, clean up whatever their siblings were doing, do their homework, and any other work they may have to do.

The final reason I think this is a terrible idea is because some people would have to do multiple activities. If someone was already doing one activity but it wasn't created as a part of the school you go to then you would probably have to start a second activity and try to balance the two activities, schoolwork, homework and anything else that they have to do after school. If they are not able to balance everything then they would have to stop doing one of the activities, and it would probably have to be the activity that is not a part of the school. Also some students may be doing a sport and sports are only for part of the year so they would have to do multiple and the start and end dated for the sports may overlap. So they would be doing two and may miss practice or a game for one of them.

In conclusion I think that schools having a mandatory after school extracurricular activity is a terrible idea because some students may have jobs after school, some may have to help their family, and some would have to multiple activities. Some students would have to balance schoolwork, homework, the two activities, a job, families, and anything else they may have to do after school. All of that may be too much for some students and they could fall behind in their classes.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

English Honors 8 3.11.2020

Dear Principal,

I have heard that there is a new rule being put into place making it so that everyone is required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For example, clubs or sports or a musical instrument, etc, but what happens if students cannot make it to the activity? What will happen when there are things or important issues that come up causing them to miss the extracurricular? I disagree with putting this rule into action because there are many reasons it isn't helping all students and here are some of my thoughts on why I think it shouldn't be a rule.

Some of the students families in school might be struggling with financial issues or aren't as financially inclined at the time being and might have a hard time keeping up. Making parents spend the money to pay for the extracurricular activity rather than paying for more important stuff isn't something we should be promoting or making a requirement.

Parents work. You work. Teachers work. Most adults work. With that being said, some parents can't take off work to take their children to the sport or club that they participate in because they don't have time and their work is important to help support the family. Along with parents not having time, students and kids can struggle with time and not being able to make it to the extracurricular. Homework and schoolwork can be a big deal to us. It affects the grade point average and then colleges and then your career as an adult. Although, that might seem far fetched but that's how others think and that's how some plan. Students might need tutoring and help and having to participate in an activity can take away that time.

I do sports and play instruments. I always have, but it's been a choice for me to participate in each of them. I once did four, but that was too much for me so I stopped one. Having the option to stop or not do an activity is something every one of us needs. People like doing new things and trying them out but to others it frightens them. Thats how it is with requiring the participation in an extracurricular activity. Some like doing things and getting out and trying different things but others find it a struggle and unnecessary to do. While I see that you are trying to help and think that this is the right option and should be something necessary I think that other families can find it is a hassle and that making kids participate in extracurricular shouldn't be required but more encouraged as a choice that is fun and new. I hope you take this into consideration.

Best,

F6DA09C9C0C1,"Did you know that 6 out of 10 kids do extracurricular activities? I agree that the principal should make everybody do at least one extracurricular activity. There are so many different things to choose from as your extracurricular activity. You could do a sport or you could even join a club. I agree with the principal because you could make new friends, you can join a club, you can join a sports team and it can help you to stay healthy and fit.

Schools offer many different sports that you can play. You can do boys or girls basketball, softball, boys or girls track and field, volleyball, wrestling, and field hockey. If you decide that you want to do a sport there are so many positive things to get out of it. It can help you to stay healthy and fit, you could loose weight and gain healthy eating habits. Also it can encourage you to step out of the box more and do new things and take more opritunities. School sports teams are a lot of fun and maybe if you like it a lot you can join a sports team outside of school.

Even if sports arent your thing then you could join a club. Schools have lots of clubs including, chess, reading club, homework club, NJHS, video game club and, the green team. There are lots of clubs at schools to join and if you decide to join a club that you've never done before or that you've never even heard of you may end up liking it. Joining clubs can inspire you to venture out and maybe even continue on with that club outside of school. Maybe you're so interested in it that you want to start your own club.

Extracurricular activities can help you make new friends. 4 out of 10 friends start in extracurricular activities. Lots of people who meet while doing a sport or a club end up staying friends for life. School is an amazing place to make new friends. You will never know or experience such great things unless you try. Having a friend that enjoys the same things that you enjoy is good too because you guys can relate on many things. While you go to practice you will always have a partner and you guys can even practice together outside of school.

I completely agree with the principals decision. Going to school may be your least favorite thing to do but if you have something to look forward to then school may become your new favorite place. School is a great place to venture out and try new things. Extracurricular activities include sports and clubs and they are a great idea and something that everyone needs to do. The principal has a good point of view because there are so many things to choose from, you could play a sport, join a club and, make new friends.         ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
58211510AB4F,"Some students don't think that doing extracurricular things like sports, yearbook, or be on student council are fun or even interesting. Students shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to do. It should be their choice to do something that they like, instead of the principal's choice.

Students have so much homework now, that they do not have time to do extracurricular things. To some kids school is more important than sports and other things. They want to focus on their future as an adult, so they want to prioritize school and not the other things. Doing good in school gets you a good job. A good job, gets you good money.

Some parents can't afford to buy the thing that the kids need to do the extracurricular activity. What if a student wants to do a sport, but they can't because their parent can't afford to buy the gear that they need. Gear is very important, so when you play a sport that you want to play, you can play safely. What if the kid is doing an art class and they need paint brushes and crayons, but they can't afford to buy it. Plus they don't even want to take that class, they are only taking the class because their principal is forcing them too.

Student might not be interested in the extracurricular activities that the school offers. Why should kids be forced to do something that they don't want to do? It's wrong for someone to do that to a child. Kids are tired enough from waking up really early and then having to do something else in the day. Maybe they aren't committed to doing something because they aren't interested in it. What you do in school is depending on your career, why would you do something are you aren't interested or committed too?

These students shouldn't be forced to do something that they don't want too do. Either they are too busy, they can't afford to buy what is required to have in that class, or if they aren't interested in it. Students should be able to choose what they want too do, not the principle. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
A917258AD9D9,"Have your parents ever forced you to go out and do something because they say you're wasting your life away? If so then you probably also know that it is not fun or enjoyable at all when you're made to do it. So when you are obligated to join a club and or do an extracurricular activity it won't be something most people are exited to do because some people just might not have enough time on their hands, they may have no interest in the activities available, and when something like that is forced upon them they may lose interest in something that they would have loved or even pursued in the future.

First off the school doesn't know what every student does after school, and if they did that would be weird, so why should they make after school activities a requirement. A good majority of the students have things they do after school whether it be practice for city league sports, looking after their parents shop, and even the copious amounts of homework they may have been assigned. Some students just don't have the spare time to do these after school activities and making it required would just add onto the stress and imbalance of their schedule.

Another problem could be that the students have no interest in the options given to them or they offer no value to what the student wants to pursue in life. Because when five out of the seven options available are sports and you don't like sports or you want to do something that isn't related to sports like engineering then you got a problem. You wont get the skills you need for what you want to do and well your not interested.

Lastly it could cause them to lose interest in something that they otherwise would have loved to do. For example imagine that soccer is your favorite sport and you enjoy playing it a lot but it's not the only thing you enjoy, but because you like it, it gets shoved down your throat every day and your being forced to do it competitively so it went from something you enjoyed and did every so often to something you hate and never want to do again all because it was forced upon you.

In conclusion I don't think that schools should require after school activities because some students may not have the time to do them, they might not have an interest in whats offered, and they could get tired or bored with something they enjoy all because it was forced. Also if an after school activity is required from every student then it's not really after school anymore it just becomes an extension of school time.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

E3098475BFE3,"The Benefits of Extracurricular Activities by Generic_Name

Some people think that extracurricular activities are a waste of time and energy. However, in my eyes, that couldn't be any further from the truth. There are plenty of extracurricular activities out there to try. You could join a sports team, try out for the school play, work in the yearbook committee, or join the student council. All of these activities have plenty of benefits: you can meet new people, learn something new, and you can have some fun.

The first benefit I found of extracurricular activities is that they can help you meet new people. If you join an extracurricular activity it's extremely likely you'll meet at least one new person there. Plus, if they joined the same activity as you, you two at least have that one thing in common. That one thing in common can lead to more things in common which could lead to a great friendship. Friends are always great to have and extracurricular activities are excellent ways to make friends.

The second benefit I found of extracurricular activities is that you can learn something new. The extracurricular activity you join is most likely going to be something you like to do, so by participating in this activity you can learn how to do that something or do that something even better. If you become more skilled at something you can do it more easily and more often. If it's something you like you won't get bored of doing it over and over again as easily as with something you don't like. Also, it's great to be able to brag to your friends about learning a new skill.

The third and final benefit I found of extracurricular activities is that they're just something fun to do. The extracurricular activity you do is most likely going to be related to something you like, so you'll be able to have fun doing it. You can also get better at this thing you like which is always a nice bonus. Additionally, it gives you something fun to do if you're bored after school and have nothing else going on. It's hard to complain about an activity when it involves something you like.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities have plenty of good benefits. They can help you meet possible new friends, they can help you learn something new, and they can give you something fun to do. Now that you know the benefits I found on extracurricular activities, why not join one or two? You might end up having a good time with it. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
BFEDA9FE9F1E,"What have a choice of being a sport, working on a yearbook, or serving in the student council? That's correct! An extracurricular activity! Activities are things you can do on the side for fun, and they help keep you active almost everyday. However, do you think that the principal should make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity? Saying that, in addition to the principal's decision, I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because an activity helps with communication, it helps students keep their minds off of the bad behaviors that they have, and parents' would not have to stress about their child.

First, an activity could help with communication. students would be able to socialize with their peers around them, in particular, they would be able to discuss and share things with each other. Also, students would take turns on sharing their thoughts and plans with their peers. Students would also learn how to work together. They would have fun activities that requires teamwork to accomplish it. Not to include that Students would have to get along with each other or else there would be consequences.

Next, It helps students keep their minds off of the bad behaviors that they have. The activities would help the students to not focus on being in the streets. The reason for that is that students would be occupied with the activity that they're in. Also, they would not be a part of any violence because of their activity. Students won't be able to go out with gang members because they're too busy after school. The same goes for fighting and any other type of violence as well.

Finally, parents' would not stress about their child. One of the reasons that parents' would not stress is because the extracurricular activities that are provided would be held after school. In that case, parents' would not have to worry about leaving work early to pick their child up. Also, there would be food provided for students. Students would have school dinner after their activity. In addition of saying that, parents' wouldn't have to worry about their child being overly hungry after school.

Some people might disagree with this decision. They might say '' I have other things to do,"" or, "" I don't like any of the activities provided!"" However, what they don't think about is how extracurricular activities can affect them positively!

In conclusion, The principal's decision is something that can have a positive effect on everyone. Therefore, I agree with the principal because it can help students socialize, students would not think about negative things in the outside world, and parents' would be stress free. As a fact, everyone should be in an extracurricular activity. Don't you think so?",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
A18AABF41A28,"Why Should students participate in extracurricular activities? This is a question a lot of students ask and today I'm going to help you learn why extracurricular activities are important. Extracurricular activities are really important and they will help you a lot. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because of Students get to exercise, learn new things, and also meet new people.

Students get to exercise. Play a sports makes you exercise. when someone plays sports they have to exercise a lot and eat better so they can have a better performance. They can get stronger. When you play for a sport they will make you lift heavy things so you can get stronger. have a better life. You will feel way more relax and healty after you start to play a sport. Because of this things I thing students should participate in extracurricular activities.

You get to learn new things. you could do an activity that you don't know. You can participate in a new activity to know if you are going to like it. Find an activity that you will like to do. If you do something you like to do you are going to be way better at it. Your knowledge can get bigger. If you learn new things you are going to have more knowledge. Because of all this things I think students should do extracurricular activities so they can get to learn new things.

I know that sometimes students don't like to participate in extracurricular activities. I know sometimes It's hard. However, try someting you think you are going to like. you can meet new people. you are going to be making new friends that are going to do the same activity that you are doing. This is why I think students have to participate in extracurricuar activities.

It is good for students to participate in a extracurricular activity it helps them learn new things.

A14D91BB2BE2,"Do you believe that schools should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity? In my personal opinion, I think that they shouldnt have to be involved for several reasons. First of all, they already have homework and school assignments that need to be completed. Secondly, some may want to use their extra free time to be involved with friends and work on their socializing skills. Lastly, some students may not have the time nor money to be able to participate in the additional activities.

My first reason to support my claim is that students have homework or class assignment that need to be completed by certain due dates. However, most activities can interfere with getting the assignment in on time. Students need the time for home work so that it doesnt decrease grade even if its a minor change. Additionally, they also need the time to study for up coming test that could affect their GPA or grade majorly. Along with that, 78% of students from middle and high schools have claimed that activities involving with their school work has added on even more stress witch has also caused a lack of sleep. Teacher could build onto that stress by pointing out their bad grades or missing assignments.

To add on to that, students ,preferably teens and preteens, need the extra time away from school to socialize with their friends or peers. If a student is involved with an activity, they may refuse to be with that friend so they can participate witch may cause their friends to quit inviting them places. Scientist have proven that being with a peer that they may enjoy being with; can take their mind away the stress from school or at home. Therefore, if a student isnt getting any socializing time, then that could affect their mental health and could cause the student to be depressed, or inherit anxiety from stressing so much. In 2018, 66% of students stated that being involved with extra activities and schools at once caused them to get depression and that affected their effort in school overall.

Furthermore, some students might not have the time nor money to be able to participate. Many students on social media, have made complaints about how practices or meeting have interfered with family gatherings. Mainly when around Christmas, Thanksgiving, or birthdays. Students also need the time to be with friends and be involved with upcoming events. To add on to this reason, some families may not have enough money for their children to participate in these events. Many activities require the students to own equipment, gear, or special clothing so that they could be involved. The average price for most sports equipment averages from 40$ to 80$ depending on the brand and quality.

You see, Kobe Bryant and other athletes have said that to be involved in sports or any extra activities, you must have the free time to do that. However, students dont have the extra time for that when they already have school work that needs to be done, friends to socialize with, and if they dont have to money for it. Students should be able to control what they can do in their extra free time. Hopefully I have persuaded you to agree with my position in this.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
7F1808A53482,"Bright lights, keyboards clicking, cold and uncomfortable seats. Sometimes we just need to take a break from non-stop working in school. I believe that all student should participate in one extracurricular activity, whether its a sport or an after school club, its good to have some free time.

Its important to get out of the work environment and to enjoy yourself. Everyone must go outside and participate in something other than school. I think its necessary for every kid to go outside and have some fun, play a sport or draw. Its very important to take a mental break and let you mind regroup and to do it in a way you enjoy! Not just a mental break but physically, working on a computer can give you head aches and neck pains. It helps to move around, even if your in a club. To get your hands on, is something every kid should experience. It could be making a poster or picking up trash, everybody should participate.

A long day at school can cause stress and pressure, one way to release that is by joining a club or sport. Mental health is extremely important, and sometimes we forget about it. Doing something you enjoy gets rid of all that stress built up and every student should release it by doing something they like. We are always being pushed by our teachers to do our best and to try our hardest, but sometimes we need something to relax to, and something we truly look forward to. Relaxation is key to being mentally healthy. Some students dont get the chance to relax, there fore all the students must participate in something relaxing to them. All students should be able to particpate in a activity without there being pressure to do the best. Students should have to have the time to relax and enjoy what they are participating in.

When being required to do an extracurricular activity, students tend to have more productivity. They tend to be more relaxed and put more effort into what they are doing. They are able to try there best in result of having some free time to relax and have fun. Students are more motivated to work, and are mentally and physically prepared to work. There grades might even increase and they might be, in whole, a lot happier. As their productivity and motivation improve so does their focus. In having their own time to take a break and relax they are better focused on their work when it comes time. Having more focus means more work getting done. Students are better at getting their work done on time, learning more and/or better, and are more motivated in school.

Therefore being required to participate in an extracurricular activity improves there over all well being. I agree with the principal, all students must participate in an extracurricular activity because it results in, mentally and physically, healthier students and its for their own good.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
4B2A3D04660A,"Imagine knowing you are going to be bored at home. Or that all of your friend were in an extracurricular activity and you weren't. Relax by playing with your friends or singing your heart out onstage. An extracurricular activity would be a great thing for you to try. I agree with this decision, because it would be a good way to learn new things, if you choose a sport as an activity it could teach you discipline, and it can help you make new lifelong friends.

It can be a great lace to learn new things. Some students parents don't teach them how to do certain things like how to be a leader. So if that kid joined something like Beta Club the teacher over that club could. It could help you get a job when you are older. Say during an extracurricular activity you were to learn a new skill. You could use that skill for a future job. It could be an unusual thing and no one else knows how to do it but you do. It could make you a lot of money in the future.

It can be a great place for a child to get disciplined. If they played sports a coach is most likely not going to deal with disrespect. Most athletes would get kicked out if they said or did something disrespectful i front of their coach , so they would learn not to be disrespectful without their coaches watching them. So in a way it would also benefit the parent or guardian. It would help them later in life when they get a job. You can't just disrespect your boss, unless you want to lose your job.

It can also be a great place to make lifelong friends. You may not find someone you have something in common with during regular school, because you are just doing school work. But if you were to participate in an extracurricular activity you can find someone you have something in common with and make a new friend. You can connect over football, baseball, or soccer. I can see why some people would disagree, because if you don't like talking to new people or it gives you anxiety it could be bad for you. But it can be great so you can work on your social skills without a teacher making you talk to them.

To conclude I agree with making everyone join an after school activity. It could help you learn new things, it could help you lean discipline for the future, and it could help you make new lifelong friends. There are a lot of pros of this happening. Even though some people wouldn't like it. I think the majority would. Also extracurricular activities are fun. Who wouldn't want to be part of a team.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
525E3781C41B,"School can be very stressful at times and it can be hard to not worry about your grades, or other school related issues. So having something to do other then school work would be very beneficial to students. There for, I agree that making extracurricular activities required would be good because it will give students a chance to meet new people, focus on something other than school work and it will keep students out of any trouble that they might have out of school.

Having extracurricular activities required for students would be very helpful because it would give students a chance to meet new people. One extracurricular activity I do is dance, and I can for sure say that I have made some of the best friendships because of it. One really important friendship that I have made is with my friend Generic_Name. She is a year older than me and has been dancing a lot longer, so I can look up to her. I am very thankful that I do dance because I would not have been able to meet one of my best friends. So I agree that doing an extracurricular activity should be required because it would give students a chance to meet new people and make new friends.

Being involved in an extracurricular activity can be good because it will allow students to focus on something other then school work. As a honors student I am required to work very hard in and out of school and it can be very stressful at times. I am required to do homework every night and study for extended periods of time. However, I always look forward to going to dance because it allows me to take a break from all my school work and focus on something I really enjoy doing. It also allows me to relax because when I am done with dance I will be able to go back to my work with a more relaxed mindset. I think that having an extracurricular activity required would be very beneficial because it allows students to take a break and focus on something other then school work.

Having to be in an extracurricular activity would make a good impact on students because it would keep them out of any trouble they would have out of school. I have seen many articles and stories where kids have had a bad background and have gotten into trouble in the past, but then they join an activity and it completely changes who they are as a person. They start to get better grades and start to care more about the people around them and in their community. I think that having students join a activity in or out of school could possibly change their life in a very positive way. There for, I agree that making an extracurricular activity required would be very beneficial because it could keep kids out of any trouble they might get into.

In conclusion, being in an extracurricular activity for me has made a very good impact on my life and as changed my life in a very positive way. It also gives other students something more to do then school work because at times school can be very stressful. So I agree that making extracurricular activities required would be good because it will give students a chance to meet new people, focus on something other than school work and it will keep students out of any trouble that they might have out of school.  ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
90ED5CDDE123,"The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Is this a good or a bad thing? Answering this question is quite simple, because there is only one correct answer. All students participating in an activity is an excellent thing. There are several reasons why kids should be in extracurricular activities. Kids should partake in extracurricular activities because of the social benefits, students will learn valuable life skills, and there are numerous health benefits.

Firstly, students need social skills to survive everyday life. Many kids in this day and age lack the basic social skills they need to excel in life. Joining the different extracurricular activities that the school has to offer can help with that issue. Students will make new friends and build bonds that could last for the rest of their lives. Making friends isn't always the easiest thing to do. But being with people that are interested in the same activity as the student will help. Communication is key in the world. Talking through social media or text is all kids know. Being apart of a group will force the kids to communicate verbally. Talking verbally is a struggle for many kids and it's important that they learn how to. Once students grow up they will have to talk face to face. It's imperative that the schools teach this skill or kids will struggle further in life. Another reason is that team working skills can be learned through extracurricular activities. Students will have to work together to complete tasks or solve issues. In adulthood teamwork is a necessary skill to have. Teaching kids basic social skills at an early age will benefit them in the future.

Secondly, kids will learn excellent life skills while participating in extracurricular activities. Responsibility is one of those life skills. Whether it's a club, sport or some other type of activity kids will learn how to be responsible. For example, kids will have to take on certain duties for their activity. Time management will be necessary, because kids will have to make time for everything in their life. Both of those are great examples of how kids will have to become responsible. Another great thing extracurricular activities can give students is ambition and healthy competitiveness. Both of which are great qualities to have to be a leader. Leadership skills is an important thing that kids should have. There will be captains, presidents, or mentors in almost all of extracurricular activities. Students can become a leader in their activity. Being a leader will help students learn what it's like to have power. This will also cause students to have the ability to help their fellow students. Kids are the future leaders of the world. It's important that they have the skills to be able to lead the world. Many kids are too dependent or they could be smothered by people in their life. This causes students to not know how to handle things on their own. Extracurricular activities will give kids the chance to be independent. Students will have to handle certain situations or make decisions on their own. It's important for kids to have a decent level of independence and to not be babied their whole life. Kids won't be able to take care of themselves in adulthood, because they were reliant on the adults in their childhood. Those were just a few examples of the amazing life skills kids will learn by partaking in activities.

Lastly, extracurricular activities will benefit kids mentally and physically. There are many health benefits of activities. Depression is an issue that many people have to deal with. It has been said that kids have been suffering from depression a lot over the past few years. Many kids feel alone or that they have no friends. Being in an extracurricular activity can show students that they are not alone. Children will feel less lonely if they are apart of something with other people. Students can bond over their struggles and even get help. Extracurricular activities can act as a support group for many students. It doesn't have to be just loneliness or depression. Kids that have a bad home life can find comfort in the group. Also, kids can become more confident in themselves. A problem that many kids face is the lack of self confidence. This can affect their grades, friendships, and most importantly their happiness. There are many other circumstances that kids might face. But all of the kids can share their pain and find peace inside of their group. Not only can activities improve mental health they can improve physical health. Many kids don't receive the proper amount of physical activity or even sunlight they need. Most children stay inside and are glued to their devices, which can lead to health problems later in life. Extracurricular activities can help children get out of the house and do something. Sports are a great example of an activity that will get kids moving. Mental and physical health aren't always a priority to society but they should be.

The principal enforcing extracurricular activities will have many positive effects on students. Social skills, the ability to communicate, and team working skills will be a great lesson that kids will learn. Students will become more responsible, independent and have enough leadership skills to run their own business. Being in an extracurricular activity will benefit the emotional, mental, and physical health of students. All of these things are highly important to be successful and happy in life. Many kids lack some of the skills listed previously, which is why it's a great idea to enforce extracurricular activities. Kids will be happier, better people, and more prepared for the future. Who would want children to not be any of those things? The answer to that is no one. In conclusion, all students should be in an extracurricular activity because of the social benefits, kids will learn necessary skills, and there are several health benefits. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
E3A2C937BE5C,"If you were or are a student who and was suddenly forced by your principle to participate in extracurricular activities how would you feel. you would probably not like to have to do something regardless of what you think. It could give you hardly anytime to do what you want to do with your life, maybe you like the idea of playing a sport or writing a story but not everyone has the time or interest in stuff like that.

There is many negative effects on the students and teachers that are caused by the principles decision to force extra work on the students and teachers of my school, I believe that there is not reason for extra work.

being force to do something that you don't want to do is annoying but tolerable, but when it is not letting you have any time for yourself its too far.

There are many negative effects on the students. Anything can be effected by someones decisions or actions, I believe that the Principle's decision to force students to participate in extracurricular activates will only negatively effect them and make things harder for them in the future. Students have it hard enough going to school five times a week, having homework, and projects and still have to deal with life at home like choirs or maybe they have an after school job that they need to do, what ever it may be students have it hard enough and would not appreciate it if they were forced to do more than they already have to do.

Students are not the only ones who are effected from this unfair change, the students need teachers to teach them and keep them in check.

Like students teachers have a life of there own and don't need more work to do.

Their is not reason for extra work. There is no good reason why students need to work harder than they already do, if anything is is doing the opposite of what it is try to do, intended giving students a chance to find something new or get better at what they like it forces then to ether do something they are not comfortable doing or not letting people work on what they want to do in the way they want to do it. Nobody likes to be forced to do something, even if it is something they are interested in it only makes them feel like they are being controlled.

The reasoning is not right, not everyone is the same and some people don't have the option to try new things but this is not the way to do it and I think that many students would agree with me saying that.

this will cause more good than bad fro the people involved in this decision. In the end people are not just going to like something because you make them do it, you have to let them do things on their own, forcing people to do things will only make them dislike it.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
A4648DC5FA2A,"The thought of extracurricular activity is a great idea in my opinion because I have a lot of free time out of school and I would love to spend it doing sports or clubs. But my opinion might not be the same for a lot of other people who may not like going outside and playing or being around other people. Most kids love to hang out with friends, but for me I enjoy just playing a little bit of basketball everyday then getting on my xbox and playing basketball game, thats just what i am good at.

Some of the pros about having these extra activities are that a lot of kids are able to meet new friends to hang out with. It can also get many kids for in shape with their body if they just so happen to choose a sport to play, but some kids may not be in to that and i am ok with that so they might choose a club which can give many kids a opportunity to have fun with other people who they might have not even known the name of before.

But there are many cons to this decision aswell. A lot of kids will just not be interested in the idea as many others would but that might not stop them from exploring what they can do or are good at. The club or activity can inter vein with the kids home life with their parents because if the kid has to stay after school a lot they will not be home to spend time with their family or have a hot dinner ready for them. The sports part of it can also mess with kids friendships and cause them to make enemies or get seriously injured play that sport.

In my opinion I think that the sports and clubs should stay optional but add more emphasis to it, make kids want to do it, for me if it was non optional I would enjoy it a lot but thats just me. it would be fun better overall for the students if they have never really been into clubs and sports like others kids have been into their whole lives.

So for me I think its has its own ups and down for kids but it should stay optional aswell as enforcing it more. please make this a thing I would love it so much because i cant play many sports, basketball is my one and only thing I am good at do I would love to expand into other sports.                                                                                  ",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
D84271FC252A,"Have you ever wondered where your best friend was when he or she wasn't on the bus? Chances are there doing something they find interesting at an extracurricular activity. For instance A sport, yearbook club, or even student council. These are all examples of after school activities or extracurricular activities. Partaking in extracurricular activities is a fun way to get yourself involved in doing something you like or trying something new if that thing interests you. Personally I'm all for it, I think that having extracurricular activities is fun and can even be something new.

Signing up for an activity you have never heard of before or haven't done before can be challenging, not knowing what to expect can be very nerve racking but thats how you learn what you like. You can always assume the worst and get the best. When I was in elementary school I thought doing chess club was going to be boring, but I actually learned lot of skills from doing that club and I made a lot of good friends that I still have today. I expected it to be boring and it turned out to be an amazing experience. Personally I always watched others and my own brother do theater for a while, and I finally said to myself in sixth grade to try it out. I had heard of it but never tried it I signed up and 5 months later fell in love. It was one of the most fun things I had ever done! Now this is my last year but if I hadn't tried it who knows where I would be right now. When my best friend was nervous about keyboarding club because he thought he couldn't type fast he didn't even want to sign up so I told him that if he doesn't like it he can quit and try something different, and so he tried it and it turned out that he liked it but didn't want to continue, so he quit and tried robotics and then he loved it. He said it was trial and error and thats true. Having to do one club is fine and if while choosing one it doesn't fit you can always try a different one. In the end trying something new can be a challenge but at the end of the day if the end result isn't what you want you can always try something new.

Theres always a mixed variety so chances are there will be at least one option that can be interesting. I'm in my last year of middle school and my sister is in her last year of Elementary school, we have a lot of differences and when it comes to taste in activities we differ from each other opinions, but we've always loved doing clubs when we were in the same school. She always loved mixing things and stirring and combining things, and on the other hand I always liked going out and playing sports and trying to get better, we moved schools and we were afraid they may not have our go to options but then we realized they had lots of variety and my sister and I knew that we would be happy there. Picking one thing out of so many different options can be hard but with variety there aren't very many repeats of the same thing, thats why when you choose something that interests you its the only thing there of its category, most likely because there are so many other options that theres no real reason for it to exist again and be the same thing. This happened to my mom when she was younger there was no real variety there were only 2-3 options to choose from and that was that. Nowadays when I'm choosing after school activities she tells me be wise because when she was younger she had barely as many as I do today. In the grand total you can always find something you'll like because of variety.

Sometimes extracurricular activities can help you realize what you really like to do, but it can also help you find and make friends who have the same interests as you. When I brought up going to chess club earlier I thought that I would dread it but it turned out to be super fun. I also met some of my best friends that I still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friends of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. In conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends.

My first reason on why I agree and think that doing at least one extracurricular activity will help you is because signing up for something you've never heard of or tried seems like a big challenge, but in the end you might really like it or feel like it suited you. My second reason was that theres always a good variety of activitys to do that you really enjoy or might want to do and this goes without saying but having a lot of different choices of specific things will help you narrow down your choices. My third reason is that you can make a lot of friends and have a very long and fun lasting relationship with people that you shared a common interest with. I believe that doing one extracurricular activity isn't a bad thing but a helpful thing to have in your life. In conclusion trying something new can always be fun and inviting.   ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
B7ECC3A7AD2B,"Participating in an after school activity is important, but should not be required. Not everybody would want to be forced to do a extracurricular activity because a lot of the people who don't, exercise on their own. Even though activities are healthy physically and mental, they should not be forced upon students or anybody, it should be their choice of how their future will be, no one should choose for them. Even doing something to help out the school would be a bad idea because that would extend a lot of the students school hours. Some students like to do homework at their home, not at school. Others have pets that they need to take care of and if their parents sent them to the vet for the day, that would cost a lot of money for them. Others could have had a horrible day and would want to go home immediately, but they would be forced too stay and that would make them feel much worse. Because students are stressed through out most of the day, staying after school for at least an hour a day would be bad for their brains. Yes I agree that after school activities is a good idea, but forcing it would take the fun out of it. Students should be able to choose what they do in their lives, not having it already chosen. Causing more stress for a student could be bad for their future, stress leads to headaches which leads to migraines, which is bad for the brain. An unhealthy brain would affect the students overall grade in school. If a student is stressed out, it will be harder for them to sleep the following night due to their brains being worn out. Students in middle school already get very little sleep from the early school hours, they will get less sleep from stress from school. If their bodies to not already produce a certain amount of meletonin, (The substance the brain produces to cause sleep) it will be much harder for them to sleep. Sleep for students and adults is very important because it effects their everyday lives. More students staying after school will also cause the teachers to have more stress from the students complaining that they are being help hostage or something in a joking way. The teachers would get annoyed from that very quickly, which would cause stress in the future for them too.

For example, if a student was the head of the student council, that means that he could have to do extra work at home instead of getting free time which helps calm the brain down. If he/she had ADHD such as myself, they might not know how to handle it as well as others with the same condition, it could make them very upset and they would not do the work, but they would be stressed because they would need to turn it in. If a kid did sports and got injured while playing or in their free time, it would affect their ability to play the sport and affect their performance in Physical Education of which would affect their grade. Somebody who does not play a sport but exercises in their free time would be forced to play a sport or stay after school and do an activity would most likely be unhappy due to the loss of their free time. I am not saying that students should not play a sport or stay after school, because they should be able to exercise in their own time and stay after school for an activity that they have chosen. Exercise is important for everybody, but it should not be forced, they will be the ones to live with their own consequences. If that where to happen. Students would fall asleep in class from being to tired to stay awake. Students would need multiple breaks through out the school day to keep them engaged knowing that they will have to stay after school. Others will be exited because that means that they will get to play sports more often because they find sports enjoyable, as others do not. If the students who play sports are passionate about sports and they lose their game, they would become upset which would cause stress because they would practice more often thinking that they will never win which could cause a breakdown from not achieving their goal under a lot of unneeded stress. If they win a game, then play against the same team again, they would think that they would easily win again, but lose due to being cocky. which would lead the the breakdown, then the other team would be cocky and so on and so forth. If at school the losing team could get mad at each other for not doing as well and could cause a fight between them, the fight would then affect their next game because they would be trying to out do each other.

Students who get in fights usually make up to each other, but not always. If they where best friends, there is a possibility that it would end up like a hockey fight without the sticks. Fights would probably suspend both of them, that would definitely effect their overall grade. The loss of a close friend or any friend at all would make them upset, which would then cause them to lose sleep the next few nights. When they are grown up, assuming they still have the record of the fight, it would be harder for both of them to get a job due to possible fights.

Most ideas on paper sound perfect if you don't think about it that much or don't think about it at all. But if you really go into detail and think of all of the possible outcomes, it becomes so much easier to find all of the flaws and becomes easier to fix them. To make a big change for students lives, you have to take the time and not rush to get it done, you have to think about preexisting conditions of some students. Consulting with the parents would also be helpful so you can see their point of view, take a vote and ease the students into a new change, not in the time span of a week or month, students would have to adapt to the change live an organism evolving to match its needs as the world changes. Because if the environment changes too quickly, the organism will die, and the death for us all is stress. Every possible outcome has to be considered for a big change, nothing should be instant.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
131D4EC3D03F,"Student's usual school day lasts about 6-8 hours. After school, students usually like to kick back and relax. Some student's might actually have things to do after-school, like sports or schoolwork. However, if they're principal takes that privilege away from them, they're after-school routine may change. Instead of having time to complete assignments, students may feel rushed to finish now that their extra time away from them. Schools should not require their students to take an extracurricular activity due to students not having time to commit to the activity, and because their stress levels may increase.

Students also might not be able to fully commit to an extracurricular activity because of their lack of time to do so. Students may already have an after-school activity that is not part of the school's extracurricular program. Some students actually need to stay home, not just to relax, but for their family. For instance, a student might need to stay home and watch over their younger sibling. Students should have a life out of school as well, and not be stuck in school every weekday. Extracurriculars, being mandatory, act as an obstacle in student's daily life. When students are out of school, they should use their extra time on things they want to do, not just things they have to do.

Being required to do extracurricular activities will also increases student's stress levels. Schoolwork is already very difficult for students by itself, why should they add on to this stress? Students need time after school to catch up on work, and what's keeping them from doing this? The mandatory extracurricular activities. Due to this amount of stress, student's may not get the chance to finish their work. Late assignments will increase, which will bring down student's grades very quickly. More missing work will increase, too, which will bring their grade down even more. Adding more after-school activities, whether it's academic or not, will cause students unnecessary stress.

So whats the issue? After-school activities block the chance for a student to actually live life out of school. School is very long and stressful, and students don't need added stress. Extracurricular activities are also very time consuming, and won't give students time to complete schoolwork or even attend other non-school related activities. Again, schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities because students don't have time to attend them, and their stress levels will increase.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
836FC7F5F535,"Students shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to do.

They can get easily fed up with doing things that they are forced to do.

So when a student that doesn't want to do a extracurricular activity, he or she would easily get fed up with it.

Which the student could drag that group down if he or she doesn't want to be in that group that does that extracurricular activity.

Here are some reasons why they shouldn't be forced to.

Students have things going on outside of school.

It can be about family, friends, school.

Now when a student has to do more work that adds on to what he or she already has to do, it can be hard on the student.

The student is now overloaded with work and can become stressed.

More work, can also hurt the students physical heath and mental health.

Mental health and physical health are the 2 big health's of the body that we all need to focus on.

With more work loaded on the student, he or she can become easily stressed.

Therefore, the student can get less sleep or have unhealthy eating habits.

In addition, with less sleep, the student is now tired and cannot think through thoroughly.

Also with the unhealthy eating habits due to stress, the student now has one more thing to worry about.

Out comes of student having mental and physical health in harm, such as being stressed with to much work can lead into bigger problems.

Depression or suicidal thoughts can rise in the students head.

Also the student can sabotage the group because he or she cannot get the work done.

In addition, he or she doesn't like it.

That student can also effect other students around the he or she.

Extracurricular activities fit some students and don't fit some students.

Students should still have the option to do extracurricular activities, but not be forced to.

As shown, it can affect mental health and physical health.

Also the student can do other things outside of school that he or she wants to do.

In addition, the student can have problems with his or her family that they are dealing with.

Work load can easily rise and stress can go through the roof for the student.

D7148D8FC7F7,"Hey, Today I am going to convince readers that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, they are fun and helpful.

It can be fun by, playing games with your friends and other fun stuff you can think about. It can also be helpful by being a leader, if you want to do sports you can become stronger and more healthier, and the activities you do can also benefit your life in the future, for an example my dad said when he was little he really didnt play sports but when he start liking sports he started to get stronger and so now he gets paid for playing football in the NFL. And to be honest it not all about sports in this reading because other activities like serving in the student council and working on the yearbook can get you to good places academic wise like a good college and a good job.

One time me and my friends was doing art for an activity and a famous painter came and gave the three of us free passes to take drawing lessons with him, all of us was so excited! See look if we would have never did the activity we would have never got those free lessons and now we might become famous painters/drawers.

There are a lot of other activities but my favorite activity is cooking because cooking can take you a lot of places in the world and I love to eat. There are about 93% of people that cook in the

World and thats a lot of people. You can even use cooking for yourself and others. You can use cooking for yourself by cooking for yourself like how are you going to survive without eating and if you cook for yourself than you can save money by not paying for other food. Did you know that you can even get paid for cooking for other people? You can work at a restaurant or you can even own a restaurant. Either way you can make money or save money and money is good.

I hope that you have made a destion on doing an extracurricular activity. I already gave you the options its just now based on your opinion.

DB5EA842EE5C,"I don't think that it is a good thing to force students to participate in a extracurricular activity. Some students might not have transportation to pick them up from the activity after school. Some students just want to go home and relax after school. The school should just let the students choose what they want to do instead of forcing them to do it. I disagree with this decision because not all students have transportation from the activities, not all students have the energy to do something after school, and there is already plenty of students that do extracurricular activities.

Not all students have transportation from the extracurricular activity. Some students' parents work all day and don't have the time to pick their child up from those activities. Most kids just ride the bus home because their parents are still working when school ends. For example, lets say that there is a students that normally rides the bus home. If that student's parents work until seven o'clock at night, than the bus is that student's only transportation home.

Not all students have the energy after school to do any other activities. Some students might not get enough sleep at night and are tired throughout the school day. Maybe some students have a young sibling that they have to help take care of. That could cause them to have less energy than normal. Some students skip breakfast, which causes them to have less energy during the day too.

There is already plenty of students that do extracurricular activities. For example we have enough for all the sports teams to have a full team. Not only do we have enough, but those students want to do those activities and haven't been forced to do it. There will always be some group of students that want to do a extracurricular activity.

Students should participate in sports. Most students like sports. It is fun and it' s good for your health. It is good to choose to participate. Students can make more friends and community.

Maybe students don' t know how to participate, because they didn' t participate before. Principal should not decided that all students must participate at least one extracurricular activity.

Principal should' t force students to participate. Participate is the only way to help students make more friends, build community and get better grade. For me, participate is the best way to learn and to get better grade, but principal should' t force students to participate. I disagree, principal should' t decided that all students must participate, because it is students choice.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
83ED986D8BC0,"Have you ever tried an in-school sport or club? Many students enjoy extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs. But some students aren't as keen on the idea. Some think it's a waste of time, or that they're very boring. But extracurricular activities help students and schools in many different ways. I think students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity because the students will learn new skills, students will become more social, and the school will become more diverse in it's interests.

There are many skills to be learned in extracurricular activities. Depending on what activity it is, you can be taught a wide variety of talents. After school sports will teach you the basics to the game, and then maybe you'll make it to the school team for that sport. Certain clubs will teach students other games and talents. At my old school, there was a huge chess club. Some of the kids that went to it every Wednesday didn't even know how to play at first. Then they learned, as any other student could if they attended a mandatory extracurricular activity. Some clubs can even teach students the basics of just being a good student or friend, like the homework club, or the diversity club. So if every student took a mandatory extracurricular activity, everyone would learn a lot.

Students can become more social through extracurricular activities. The more students spend time with people with similar interests, the more friends they'll make. If a student was to only hangout with the same group of friends all year, he or she would never become more social, which is a good skill to have as you get older. Besides, a student might make a life long friend through an extracurricular activity. Even if a student doesn't make any new friends through extracurricular activities, they'll still have learned important communication and social skills.

If a school has a large variety of extracurricular activities that every student is attending at least one, the school will become more diverse in the student's intersests. Diversity in a school is very important for many reasons. Diversity would look good on how the rest of the county views the school. Then they might follow suite and make extracurricular activities mandatory. Another reason why diversity in a school is important because the students will impact each other and make each other want to try more activities, making a postitive cycle in which students want to partcipate in extracurricular activities, therefore benefiting them in the other ways, social and skill benefits.

In all, mandatory extracurricular activities will help our school system in plenty of ways. They'll teach students skills, make students more social, and make the school more diverse. These are just some of the reasons that schools need mandatory extracurricular activities. If you want madatory extracurricular activities at your school, start a petitionfor your principal to see. Even if that doesn't work, you can always just convince your friends and classmates to go to these extracurricular activities. This is why I believe schools should have mandatory extracurricular activities.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
E3B5F5E76B04,"Imagian getting home from school at around five and then doing homework till like seven or eight sounds crazy right well thats what will happen if students are fourced to do an extracurricular activity. Us students simply wouldn't have time for anything else which is why I disagree with making students dp a curricular activity. Some of us students just don't have the time and are far to busy with things like getting home late, doing homework or studing, plus some kids babysit.

The first reason I disagree is because some parents don't get off work till really late and wont be abke to pick up their kid on time from practice. Parents might not be able to drop their kids off at the games or turnemnts and the kid may fell as tho they let the team down. Plus if family were to pick them up then they would be stuck at a family member's house and unable to go home and do what they need to.

The second reson is some kids have giant amounts of homework and studing to do. If you make a student do a sport or a club then homework won't be done till really late. This will cause kids to have no time outside or to hang with friends. Which may lead to them not doing homework or studing that way they can go outside with friends,thus causing grades to slip.

The third and final reason is some students our age have to babysit their younger sibling or cousin. However, with an after school activity they will not return home in time to watch said family members. And lets not forget that some students have jobs as babysitters for other people's kids.

Now I understand that some people may say ""oh but it's good for young children to do an after school activity and I agree, however some students are far to busy and should not be fourced to do an after school activity its not that we're lazy or anything we'er just to busy.

so in conclution i believe students should not be fourced into an extracurricular activity some of us are truely to busy for one being that we will get home late, have to much homework, and no time for friends, along with watching younger family members there is no time",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
FE776C83FE1B,"This would be good for students in many ways. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things that come from having a extracurricular activity. Principal's should start doing this in all schools . Its really nice to get students out of their comfert zone sometimes. Students normally don't try for sports in school because they don't want to go through the fact if they don't make the team. Its hard for some people to go and try for something but some students don't think to themselfs if i dont try i will never know if im good at any sport.

Most students stay at home and be lazy all day. Being lazy is not good for the body and brain. Getting in a sport is amazing because people might have to take care of their little brother's or sister's and don't have time to take care of themselfs first or people might have other things to do but its always nice to put your health first. People can be very lazy and just lay around and eating junk food and playing video games all day and this is a good way to get outside and be with your friends. Alot of things that people are probably doing right now is not heathy for them, eating junk food is not good, playing video games and being on your phone to much hurts your eyes and its really important if u want to try for a sport if your eyes are good. It's just a great way to get kids off their phone and go outside.

Students tend to not socialies if they don't have to. Most teens in middle school lay in bed and scroll though instagram all day and night. Sports is a great way to get your social skills up. Some people are shy as well and might not try as well the first day ,however, students will get used to doing stuff in front of other people are give it there all. It's a great way to get kids out if their comfert zone and talk to new people they though they would never talk to.

We all know sitting at home is not that fun. Everyone gets bored at home and have not idea what to do, you run out of things to do on your phone and if you have no friends that live close to you it's very hard to find something to do. Doing a after school activity gets your mind off of things and gives you something to do after school. Being with friends is always fun when your doing something you want to do. People tend to just try out for a sport but not really try at the sport. Most students just go to talk to their friends and put no effort in the sport. You still have to try and put in a lot of effort going in to this kind of activity.

Principals should make kids pick a extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision becasue all students should have fun and do something they would not do. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things about doing a sport after school. You should go out and try for any sport you can and you can get better and better everyday. Nobody is holding you back from doing something you want to try doing.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
BF950D449303,"Schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities because that can induce stress and not have time to spend with your family. On the other hand some people believe it's better in order for students to be academically inclined to do well in school.

Having students forced into extracurricular activities can lead to stress which can eventually impact students negatively. Negative stress can lead to failing classes, bad house habits and suicide.

For example stress leading to class failing can really have a big impact on a students life if they have to repeat a grade, it can possibly make it harder for them to graduate and even find a stable job. So if these bad impacts happen then society might just perish due to stress given off by forced extracurricular activities. Stress really can lead up to fatal consequences if there's enough stress going around because of forced extracurricular activities. People usually do well if there is nothing that stresses them out but with forced extracurricular activities the stress will double and even triple in the size it was mentally before hand. Forced extracurricular activities can also lead up to time spent with family decrease.

Forced extracurricular activities could take a significant amount of family time away impacting the students relationship with their family and those around. This could make a stable family unstable and make them argue often because the student isn't on the same page as the family due to family time loss from going to the forced extracurricular activity after school. This can also impact a students mental and emotional health for example there are many students with elderly people whom they cherish, they might have little time to live so time with them can have a major impact on their emotional health. But if time where taken away these students won't spend the amount of time they need with the elderly to be emotionally stable since the elderly might die any day. If this happens students might learn to associate school with bad things that keep you away from those whom you cherish deeply.

Forced extracurricular activities shouldn't exist due to reasons like stress and family time loss, which can mentally, emotionally and academically affect students due to extracurricular activities. This is why forced extracurricular activities shouldn't ever surface in this beautiful country we know as The United States.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
AC7FEF69749E,"Our principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with the principal because extracurricular activities are very important, not only to your health, but to your fututre. Colleges have started looking into extracurricular activities more now then before. Not to mention how much fun they can be.

College is important. It helps set you up for your job and 'adult readiness', but first, you have to get into college. Applications are important, they are a main factor in getting into college, but I wouldn't neccesarily call it your 'make or break'. Grades are exceedingly important when applying for college, but extracurricular activities are just as important. Extracurricular activities can help show that you can commit to something, follow through with it, and you might be very good at it. The more extracurricular activities, the better. For example, let's say an A average student who did no extracurricular activities applies for a college. Another B average student who did one or two extracurricular activities applies for the same college. The B average student is more likely to make it into the college than the A

average student because of their extracurricular activities.

Extracurricular activities can mean many things. It can mean sports, clubs, volunteering, and many more. Sports are well-known to be good for your health. It helps you exercise and stay in good shape. Laziness, especial in teenagers nowadays, is very common. Being required to move and exercise would do our health and body good. Even if we don't do a sport and we chose a club. Clubs normally make you exercise your brain and make you think in a different way than school usually requires you to.

Finally, it can be fun! Many people who do extracurricular activites found that they liked a certain activity more than others. I, for one, have that expieriance. I tried many sports such as soccer, basketball, baseball, swimming, and ballet. I thouroughly enjoyed swimming, baseball, and ballet. However, I didn't do baseball. Now, I'm on pointe in my ballet and going on to my eleventh year of dance and my summer swim team was the Division and Finals champions. I love my extracurricular activities and I feel as though my life would be fairly boring without them.

There are so many benefits in doing extracurricular activities and being required to participate is merely helping you get the leg up on your future. In the end, it's all worth it, every bit. It does so much good in your life that you won't even relise it until your older. Therefore, I agree and support the principal in their decision.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
04AF157D14EA,"Students should be told to do at least one extracurricular at school because doing an extracurricular can help students become more physically healthy, they can leave a lasting impression on their school and they can meet new people. All these can come from doing an extracurricular activity after school. I agree with this decision by the principal since most pupils will have good outcomes by doing an extracurricular activity. Students have a wide range of choices for their activity for example, students could choose to participate in sports such as baseball or basketball, work in the math club, the model U.N.

All the clubs you can think of the school most likely provides for their students to choose, however out of all the good reasons to force students to participate in these extra activities do have some setbacks. Some of these setbacks include the fact that maybe some students have responsibilities after school such as babysitting, jobs or religious reasons.

First, Students who choose to be apart of clubs such as the Student Government or National Junior Honor Society can revolutionize their school and create change in rules that they do not favor as much as other rules. These clubs usually encourage free thinkers and people who wanna to create change and revitalize their school when it gets a little stale and boring. Some kids might join a sports team or musical ensemble and win a championship or a musical trophy that the school can proudly display like all the other trophies that the school has won. Most schools are very proud of their pupil's accomplishments in or out of school usually displaying their accomplishments such as their students who went to the NBA like Kobe Bryant or became very famous actors like Tom Cruise.

Nelson Mandela once said, ""Education is the key to life and happiness"" and if that is true partially extracurricular can help you achieve that. As most colleges look at your application form they look at your Grades ACT and SAT but what they also look at is what extracurricular you are in such as clubs, sports teams or musical acts such as a band or ensemble.

Next, students can become more physically healthy and fit when doing some activities after school. The main example of that is a school sports team that the students can join like track or swimming can help them lead a healthy lifestyle and lose weight while filling their requirements to do a school extracurricular activity. These school sanctioned activities can help students become more fit and lose weight because of the sport. Sports in general are a good way to teach kids to be healthy and not sit at home all day and lay in bed or on a couch all day after school. Kids are easily impressionable to anything or anyone that tells them what they like such as a junk food commercial or a commercial for sugary cereal, these commercials tell them that the cereal that they are marketing is healthy but in reality it is just a sugary full of carbohydrates cereal. By letting kids stay after and teaching them what foods are healthy for them or not we can reduce the impact that childhood obesity has caused the last couple of years.

Lastly, most students who participate in after school activities can meet a lot of new people who are interested in the same things as you are and you can talk to them in the clubs or other activities you have joined. Most people who join clubs are often interested in the same things as everyone else in that club, there even some clubs just about certain interests such as the anime club which is just a club for kids who like anime or manga. Other clubs and extracurricular are also good places to meet new people if you are new to a school and need people to talk to.

these friends you make can become lifelong friends of yours even out of school and into college or the workforce and adulthood. These bonds that you make in middle school and high school can increase your social skills and help you with life skills like communication with other people, a skill needed in jobs like marketing where you most likely need to present in front of other people sometimes including your boss.

In conclusion, being told to do one extracurricular by your school isn't the end of the world you can make it fun by choosing a club or sport that you enjoy to do and it will not be a burden on you or your family. In these extra activities you can create a better you and show your school that, you can become healthier and you can always meet new people who share common interests with you. All the students are required to do an extracurricular most likely because the school just wants the best for you and your academic career whether that is from K-12 or beyond to college and the workforce extracurricular help you in many ways throughout your life, these clubs ensembles and teams can boost your self confidence, fortify your social skills while you have fun since you have chosen things that interest you and are not boring.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
4423B65DF221,"There has always been extracurricular activities being offered in schools, even in my old house in Generic_City, but many students don't take advantage of these resources given to them. This is why I believe that students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity. I make this claim for three reasons, the first of which being that students are more involved in the community that the school built around them. My second reason is that students doing sport related activities helps with exercise and having the need to stay in shape for the team and the school. Last but not least, my third reason is that students that may not have many friends could use these activities as a way to get to know people that are doing the same sport or are in the same band. So I believe that these extracurricular activities would be beneficial not only to the students but the school as a whole.

For my first reason I stated that doing an extracurricular activity helps students get involved in a community that was created around them. Students that join sports or other activities provided usually get to know others that participate in the same team or group that the student does. Another reason to back up my claim is that in clubs or competitive sports teams these students generally train together and help each other succeed in the task that they are working towards achieving. I believe that these activities would help tremendously with letting students get to know each other and further strengthening the schools community.

My second claim is that doing extracurricular sports help students get exercise that generally they would not get, had they not been told to do any exercise outside of school. If these students play for a school team (football, wrestling, etc.) there is intense training involved that from, personal experience, is not easy. Im not saying to go run a mile or anything but these sports try to get every competitor in great condition in order to get students to succeed in tournaments and bouts or matches against other teams. So there is a huge exercise component to most sport related activities.

For my third reason, let's start with a small story. So, imagine that there is a student that moves around every two to four years. it was pretty difficult to make friends so he generally stayed at home playing video games by himself and didn't really go out at all. That was me until around three years ago and doing sports like wrestling and rugby have helped me make friends. So I understand how difficult it is to always be the new kid but these activities let me make friends and get to know people. Students that do these activities usually make friends with the people that have the same interests in activities.

I believe that enforcing this rule would be beneficial not only to the school but the students as well and these reasons are why I believe in this rule. Communities get built around the students when they do these extracurricular activities. Physical fitness is also a big motivator for a few students with sports related activities. And last but not least, these students can make friends in these activities like I did when I used to move around a lot. Extracurricular activities would be a good service to enforce in schools.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
3441F00346EA,"I would agree with the decision to make all students participate in after school activity. I would agree with this decision for a couple of different reasons. One of them would be bringing people together. Parents may start to think and appreciate the teachers more for going above and beyond staying after school to work with there kids. This would paint a new path and a new picture for the schools future.

Not only only would extracurricular activities get more students and teachers working together forming good relations, but it would help students see teachers and the school in a new light. Students may start to appreciate there teachers more and may start to like them. Students could feel more confident with there teachers because they share some of the same interests. Not only this but the teachers may get to see how hard working there students are working outside of school, and maybe the students just need a push or in other words a little bit of help.

I feel like parents also would appreciate getting the kids off there butts and getting them to interact with there fellow teachers and students. By making encouraging there kids to have a open mind about after school activities they could also find out what there schools offer and possibly the parents could be interested. The students who look at taking after school activities with a good attitude will get hooked and find something they really enjoy. When the students come home from there extracurricular activities they could tell there parents all about it and maybe teach there parents something they dont know.

When you sign up or good to a after school activity try and go with at least one friend who is also interested in the same topic. This will give you a safe feeling and you will have someone to share the fun with you! Not only will you have one friend there but if you bring a friend there is a 100% chance you will make more friends there. The teachers will find it very exciting you found a extracurricular activity you enjoy and made new friends. With all the work you will be doing in your after school activity at least when it gets hard you will have a friend next to you to make it better.

In conclusion I think this is a very positive decision made by the principal and agree with it completely. There are so many benefits to going to after school activities. Meeting new people and finding interests you may have never new about. For all you know you could have found a career you love and want to do as a job. Finding new friends and meeting new teachers and strengthening you relationship with your teachers is a very smart thing to do. I would highly recommend other schools to do the same as this school and help your students find a activity they love.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
BF795A45BEA1,"After school activities should be optional because kids might not have the time, it could cause stress, and some kids wouldn;t be interested. Why should a student be forced into an activity when they have chores? what about the amount of extra stress? Plus, sports and yearbook aren't everyone's favorite thing.

As stated before, some kids don't have time for things like activities. A student might have to babysit a sibling, do chores, work around the house, or even have a job!

There's no reason for making extra activities mandatory. Meetings early in the morning? Less sleep for growing children. After school? There's enough at home to handle. Even the middle of class wouldn't work, as the student would fall behind.

Not only will it mess up a kids schedule, it'll cause stress. Life can be stressful for students. Especially when dealing with tests, quizzes, and changes to the student. Add in an activity that'll cause them to have less distressing time and you'll have a meltdown waiting to happen. You can't expect a student to be able to handle that. If students actively pick an activity to do, it's because they know they can handle the time management.

And finally, Not everyone is going to be interested. Sure, the students might be cool with it for the first week, but then it'll be bothersome and annoying. Activities should be optional, not mandatory. It takes the fun out of everything. Whether you let the students pick or not, it won't matter. Not everyone wants to join the sports team. Not everyone wants to work for the yearbook. Some people would prefer going home and relaxing at the end of the day.

While it seems like a good idea, mandatory participation should't be a thing. Most kids are trying to spend time with family, not giving them time to do sports. Some people might already be stressing over tests and grades, causing more stress in activities. And let's not forget that not everyone would be interested in kicking a ball around or painting. It may be for the best, but it's also the worst to make activities mandatory.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
DB06022F504E,"From ballet to yearbook, there are many extracurricular activities you can take part in, but there are more benefits that come with extracurricular activities than meets the eye. Some people don't do extracurricular activities because of fear and uncertainty. Avoiding extracurricular activities can have a negative impact on your life. There are many benefits, long term and short term, to doing extracurricular activities. If extracurricular activities are made mandatory, it can help students overcome fears and find things they're passionate about. Making extracurricular activities compulsory for students will help them by creating new friendships, helping them get into collage and giving students new experiences.

Making extracurricular activities compulsory will help students make friends and build relationships. Engaging in extracurricular activities will help students find people they have something in common with. For example, last year I was in the green eagles club and I met a lot of people I might not have hung out with otherwise. Going to clubs and after school activities will help student meet people they would not usually be friends with and help broaden your perspectives.

Many students are shy and have a hard time making friends, but if extracurricular activities are made mandatory it will help pull them out if their shells and develop social skills which are incredibly important throughout life. Having all student go to extracurricular activities will also introduce kids to many different types of people so that they have a better view of the world.

Engaging in extracurricular activities can help you get into a good collage. While collages will look at your grades, they will also look at your extracurricular activities. Collages want not only smart people but also well rounded people who have many interests and will bring something to their school. When I asked my cousin, who goes to Generic_School, about when he applied for collage he said that collages will look at tons of people with good grades but what makes you stand out is your extracurricular activities and the extra things you do. Therefore, if it's mandatory for kids to do extracurricular activities, they will have a higher chance of getting into a good collage and this will help them in the long run.

Taking part in extracurricular activities will give students new experiences. Whether it's being in an uncomfortable situation or just hanging out with your friends, your experiences are important because they are part of what shapes who you are as a person. If students take part in extracurricular activities, they might even find something they truly enjoy doing. Being in an extracurricular activity will expose students to other ideas and cultures which will in turn broaden their perspectives and make them more empathetic. When I was in sixth grade and I told one of my friends I was vegetarian, she said sorry, looking at me with pity. After a while she learned that I chose to be vegetarian, and that I enjoy it. This changed her perspective on what vegetarians are like and has made her more aware. When you expose kids to ideas, especially controversial ones, it helps them start to formulate their own opinions bases of of what they think and not what others tell them to think. It is very important that all people are exposed to others who are different to themselves and if all students take extracurricular activities, they will benefit through learning about their peers.

Building relationships with people is an important skill that will be used throughout life and extracurricular activities will force students to be in positions where they will make friends. In the long run, extracurricular activities will help you in many ways such as getting you into a good collage which will eventually help you lead a good life. Taking extra curricular activities will make you a more well rounded and aware person and might even help you discover a passion. On top of this, by taking an extracurricular activity, students will gain new experiences which will broaden their perspectives. It is vital that students are exposed to other cultures and types of people because this will over all help to shape their out look on the world and make them more empathetic human beings. If extracurricular activities become mandatory, students will benefit because, they will make friends, it will help them get into collage, and give students new experiences.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
2C0D4A3D4590,"I disagree, because some times there is nothing there that interest. Many schools dont have a program that people like. So if they force some one to do something that they dont like it could make them frustrated. There is something good to it. It can make them try new stuff.

It can get them interested new jobs they can try. A new future they can try to achieve. it could also make them a more interesting person. More possible people talk to about the topic. But they could despise the topic.

Than forcing them in to it could make the hate it more. There could be some personal stuff that do's not let them join a club. some personal trauma that makes them less likely to join a club. it could also be that they just dont want to do it. Being part of a sports team is also very physically demanding.

There is always chance they could not make it on the team. Plus there is always a chance of being kicked out of the club or team. Plus if you try a sport out and figure out that you dont like it you can always quit. There is always a chance that the club could not even help you in the real world. There could be no real world implication.

Well my principle thinks that all students must participate in some type of activity or sport during school. I have a few opinions on that. First of all there are different types of people. Not everyone likes to participate in sports or activities. Theres also people that aren't very social so, participating in anything might not be there thing. Then theres some that are just lazy. On the other side their are people that like to participate and be social with people. Theres actually interested in sports or school activities. But sometimes poeple just want to talk with their friends. I think it should't be required to participate in school activities. You should be able to choose what you want to do. Like if you don't participate you should just be able to hangout with your friends while, others can play sports or participate in activities. If some poeple choose to do sports or be in any sort of activity thats great for them.

School Principals Should Not Require Extracurricular Activities

Their are many benefits to participating in after school activities, they can improve your knowledge on a variety of topics, introduce you to new experiences, provide a chance to strengthen your social skills, and most of all they can be enjoyable! They are not usually enjoyable however, when you have been forced into taking them, and especially not when everyone in your school has been forced to also. There are many reasons why students don't want to or even can't partake in these activities some of which being that it is a financial struggle for many families, it causes a stress for time, and can lead to disappointment.

Some parents cannot afford to pay the fees required to enroll their children in extracurricular activities. Imposing a rule that these activities are mandatory would mean that they would have to spend the money that they need for other more important things in order to satisfy the principal's instructions. This would then deprive them of a comfortable home life since they would be unable to purchase certain needs, and even farther from receiving any desired luxuries. It may even endanger them because they are in an unsafe predicament that they can't afford to get out of.

The children's guardians might not have a flexible schedule that will allow them to take time to transport their child to and from their activities. Making them required would result in parents having to take time off of work or enlist others to either accomplish their home responsibilities or pick up their child from the school activity. The students would suffer from time deprivation as well. Time that the students should be spending on school work or family interaction would instead be put towards their activities. They would also not have any time to develop personal hobbies since they would be participating in arranged activities.

Because every student would be enrolling in school clubs at once there would be high competition and a large portion of the students would end up in activities that they don't want. This would leave them disappointed about their assignment and disdainful of the principal's program. There is a possibility that it would even discourage them enough not to partake in similar activities in the future. Thus this requirement has more of a possibility of restricting the students strengths and cutting their future options further in life.

Though there are some rewards that come with participating in extracurricular activities not everyone should have to. Each person has different factors to consider when choosing whether or not to join an after school club or sport. Furthermore, it should be up to the student and their family to decide if they can participate in these groups.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
329FDFF9DAEF,"Making students participate in a extracirricular activity would be a good idea. Extracirricluar activities can help students gain more experience of physical strength, social activity and interaction, and new learning experiences. For example; A student who plays football outside of school can strengthen their physical and social health by playing with other team mates and working out at the same time, while maintaing new knowledge about the sport which would include new learning experiences too.

Participating in other activites outside of school can help a student figure out their true interests and help them discover carrers for the future. Making students try and learn something new can be beneficial if they are having trouble finding what peaks their interest. However, there may be some downfalls to this new idea. Extracirricular activites may sometimes not be so easy to manage. Especially with sports or activites for the school. Some activites can make students weeks feel stressful and overwhelming at times. Sometimes actvities can mess with the students outside life such as; traveling, family, religious purposes, etc.

Activites that are easily able to maintain with the persons schedule and peaks the students interest should be acceptable to participate in. New opportunities could come up for the student reguarding to college or even future jobs. If a student decides to choose this activity in the future, companies would see that they have extra experience and might increase their chance of giving or accepting job offers to that particular student. If he/she works hard in school and maintains a healthy schedule that would not affect them severly, the student might get a scholarship from many different colleges and major in that specific category.

He/she might even make new friends in their new activity and might increase their chance of wanting to continue doing the program with them. Making new friends is also beneficial and could help increase the persons chance of wanting to continue participating in this new sport or activity.

Overall, making students participate in extracirricular activites outside of school or for the school would be great to improve the students physical, social, and emotional health, help the sudent gain more knowledge about the acitvity, and decide future carrers and interests.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
DF5281802CF1,"""My biggest in life is to help kids believe that they can be anything when they grow up.""-Kobe Bryant. School is not only for learning but also for helping students practice valuable life skills. As most students think that school is just about learning, it is also teaching them important skills that they need to know later in life. Therefore, having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as sports is a good idea because it helps students work on important skills such as collaboration, creativity, and hard working.

Collaboration I think is the most important skill to have to know on this list. Not only will you have to know how to talk properly at work, you will also need to know how to talk properly anywhere you go. That is why the more you talk to people in a group the more you help your collaboration skills. Collaboration doesn't always have to be oral. It can be done when texting someone. Make sure you think before you speak also that is on where everyone has trouble on, even adults.

Creativity can be good be bad. It can be good if your on a sports team and your need to make an exciting play. Creativity can also be found in artwork. Only the most beautiful artwork is fond from a creative artists. Now the reason creativity can be bad is if you take the lazy way out. By that I mean, say John's mom tells him to take out the trash but he don't feel like doing it, he then realizes that the trash can was left open. He decide to shoot the trash like it's a basketball in the trash. John then misses and he is left with a pile of trash to clean up. That is how creativity can be bad.

A hard working person is a person who he/she puts effort into something to get it done. The more someone says they can't, the more they're telling their brain to just give up. But the more they tell themselves they can then they can do it. Just think of Jason Pierre Paul. He plays for the Philadelphia Eagles. When he lost his arm as a young boy he though he would never be able to play in the NFL with his brother. But he didn't quit and he showed the world how much effort he put into wanting to play in the NFL. He went on to win best defenses man of the year award. All because of his hard work.

In conclusion having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as sports is a great way to help students practice their collaboration skills, creativity skills, and hardworking skills. Every body needs to start learning these skills at a young age. So they can grow up to be a civilized human being. All we need is some modern civilized people. If we had them this world would be a better place to live in.                                    ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
AF5E5BF38512,"Have you ever been forced to do something you might not always want to by a parent or a teacher, such as an after school activity? Many students are pressured to sign up for sports, clubs, or other extracurricular activities by parents, friends, and teachers. This ensures that they are getting physical activity, time off electronics, and are spending time with their community. However, students should not be forced to participate in these extracurricular activities because of their homework and jobs, lack of time spent with their families and friends, and the money some families do not have to pay for these activities.

Students' lives are almost always busy, and many rarely have a chance to relax. First, they have to spend eight hours of their day in school, only to go home and do two hours of homework. After that homework, many students go work jobs to save for college or build a resume. Even after that job has ended, students go home and may have to help do chores around the house. Only after those fourteen hours of the day have flown by is the student allowed to finally get ready for bed, struggle to get their required eight hours of sleep, and wake up only to do it all again. With this crowded schedule, it would be near impossible to manage an after school activity that lasts about two hours on top of all that. Kids should be able to enjoy their childhood by hanging out with their friends and relaxing, not having to worry about how the yearbook is coming along, if the sports teams are doing well this season, and if the school has the budget for prom at the end of the year. Those are enrichment activities that people without as busy lives should be able to choose to partake in, not forced to.

People hear a lot that they should strive to spend quality time with their friends and family, to ensure they don't become a little hermit that lives in a secluded world of their own. On top of the already insane schedule many students maintain, there's very little time left for spending time with friends and loved ones. Many students miss out on going to the mall on weekends with their friends, going out on dates with their significant other, and laughing at movies with their parents and siblings because they're busy working, applying to colleges, or doing homework that a teacher assigned to them over the weekend. Forcing them to participate in extracurricular activities does not benefit the situation at all. On top of not being able to spend time with the people that mean most to them, they're being told to run laps at sports practices, waking up at dawn to get ready for the big game, taking pictures for the yearbook at events, or going to meetings with the other student government members to plan the school dance. This causes immense stress for students, and it also weakens the bonds and strains the relationships between students and their friends and family.

It's not exactly difficult to see the fact that many students' families struggle financially. Many times, the only time students ever get to eat is at school, and often don't have enough money for hygiene, clothes, or school supplies. If these students are forced to participate in these after school activities, they may not be able to afford it; if they can, it often becomes even more of a struggle for the family, as that money could have been spent on paying the bills or food, rather than it being spent on sports uniforms and gas for cars that need to be driven to and back from practices, meetings, and events. Sports tend to be very expensive, with registration fees, uniforms, proper equipment, gas to drive the students places, and snacks to provide after school, as many students need to eat during practices. ninety percent of Americans are already in some sort of debt, whether it's student loans, house mortgage, cars, or just bad spending. Adding the cost of sports or other after school activities will drown students and their families in bills that they may not be able to pay off.

Although it is a good idea for students to participate in extracurricular activities, they should never be forced to because it impacts many students negatively because of their busy schedules, lack of time with their friends and loved ones, and because of the financial struggles many students' families face and may not be able to afford. Instead, students should be able to say whether they can and want to participate in these activities, or be able to not do extracurricular activities and be able to relax and spend their leisure time however they please.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
CC9DB5A93782,"Should students be required to attend extracurricular activities? Would this really help students and provide enjoyable experiences? While there are some good things that could come out of requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities, there are some downsides as well. Personally, I disagree with the decision to require all students to participate in the activities because some students may not enjoy doing extracurricular activities, or simply might not have any time to attend them. Extracurricular activities do give some students the opportunity to expand their knowledge in certain areas, spend time with friends, and maybe help them find their passion in life, but other students may not be as positively impacted in the same way as others.

So, there are the students who don't enjoy participating in extracurricular activities. There are many students who don't prefer to do these activities because perhaps they are socially awkward and would rather avoid social interaction. Maybe there just isn't an activity that is available to them that is of interest. Another reason is that they might enjoy doing something else that doesn't qualify as an extracurricular activity. It isn't right that the principal is forcing students to do something they don't want to do. Students should be able to choose what they want to do and how to spend their time. Some may learn how to enjoy an activity after joining one they were unsure about, but others may end up not enjoying the experience at all, therefore, giving them something not to look forward to that was forced upon them with the intention of a positive impact.

Other students may not like the decision that requires them to attend extracurricular activities, specifically activities held after school hours, because they already have plans, and being forced to attend activities would break in to their already-planned schedules. Scheduled plans such as family events; religious events; sporting events that don't directly involve the student; work hours for a job; or perhaps just time to finish schoolwork. All of these examples are things that students may not feel obligated to cancel, just so they can attend an activity that was forced upon them. There will obviously be some times when students are allowed to miss out on the extracurricular activities they are supposed to attend, but why give students a sense of worry about not being able to go to an event that they might feel very obligated to attend?

Once again, I disagree with the decision to force students for participate in extra curricular activities because some may not enjoy doing them, and others may not have time to attend them. The fact is, is that the principal should not be forcing students to attend extracurricular activities. The principal should be giving every student the opportunity to find one and attend one if they wish to, but never have it be mandatory that they do. Many students do enjoy attending extracurricular activities, but it is important to consider the few who don't when making a decision like this. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
95A6AB619F10,"Imagine a school where no student feels left out and everyone has a group of friends where they belong. The students are genuinely happy to be in school, are generally in a good mood, and are also doing well academically. This would be the result of all students participating in an extracurricular activity. An extracurricular activity is any activity that someone does outside of school, like sports, working on the yearbook committee, or serving on the student council. Our principal should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will encourage students to make friends and develop new skills.

Requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities gives them the opportunity to make new friends. Anyone who has been a part of a team or club knows that when someone is a part of a group, they form friendships that can last. Additionally, students who were always too afraid to be themselves at school would have a second chance at doing so by buiding confidence. Having friends is important because friends can make a person happier overall and give them a sense of belonging. Making friends outside of school will also earn them more friends in school. Soon, the empty nearby seats at the lunch table will be occupied with people that a student met at one of their extracurricular activities. Some people may not be very social at school, but participating in an activity outside of school will give them the chance to speak up and form strong friendships.

Whether a student is interested in doing sports, cooking, or participating in an academic competition for their extracurricular activity, they will develop several important skills along the way. The most obvious skill they will develop: being able to do that particular activity. However, students will also develop leadership skills, collaboration skills, and many other skills that can be applied to tasks and activities that they will do in the future. For example, one extracurricular activity that I participate in is dance. Dance has taught me how to work well in a team because I have to work with the other girls in my group to create unified movements. Dance has also taught me leadership skills and teaching skills because I often teach dance classes for the students at a lower level. I have the responsibility of deciding what they need to accomplish that day, and then executing it. Like dance, extracurricular activities can teach students important skills, that will benefit them in school and in the future.

In the end, requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity will only benefit them by giving them the opportunity to make new friends and develop important skills. If someone is marked as the ""shy kid"" at school and doesn't have friends, participating in an extracurricular activity will build their confidence to speak up and make friends. Extracurricular activities can also teach students important life lessons and give them skills that will improve their work and relations in school and in the future. All in all, requiring students to take extracurricular activities is a decision that at first glance seems terrible because it takes away the students' freedom, but in reality, it will have many positive effects on their lives.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
5EB03D5E79DC,"""UGH,"" groaned Generic_Name. ""What happened?"" asked Generic_Name ""I have nothing to do after school,""

said Generic_Name. ""Don't you have any clubs or sports after school,"" said Generic_Name. ""Nope,"" said Generic_Name. ""Well do you have any homework?"" asked Generic_Name. ""Maybe..."" said Generic_Name. ""So you have homework,"" said Generic_Name. ""Fine! I have a lot of homework, but I don't want to do any of it,"" said Generic_Name. ""You know, you could always join the homework club,""said Generic_Name. ""Whats that?"" asked Generic_Name. ""Its an after school club where you finish your homework, missing assignments and more,"" said Generic_Name. ""That seems like it could help me a lot. I guess I'll try it out,"" said Generic_Name. The benefits of joining the homework club are being more cooperative in class, finishing any homework, and helping other students.

Firstly, Students would be more cooperative in class. They would be more cooperative because they are finishing their work in the homework club. They would more likely understand whats going on in class, because they got help on what they were confused on. For Example, My best friend Generic_Name just started going to the homework club. Ever since she started going, Shes been more focused/cooperative in class. The club helped her become more engaged in class. For Instance, My cousin never focused well in class, so he went to homework club. Now he is more cooperative in class because he understands the things he was confused about. The club helped him understand better, and when he understood better, he become more focused in class.

Next, Students would finish their homework. Sometimes students might have a lot of homework or missing assignments, so they procrastinate and don't finish their work. By not finishing their work, their grades start to decrease. For Example, I procrastinate a lot because of the amount of homework or assignments I get. I started homework club a month ago, and I have been finishing all of my homework and assignments. I started to procrastinate less. Another Example, My friend Generic_Name never did her homework. Her grades are were really bad, so she joined the club and now she is carefree. She is carefree because she finishes her work in the homework club and she doesn't have to worry about it.

Finally, Students can help other students. They can help because they might have already learned the same thing as the other student and might help them understand it better. For Example, When I was at homework club, a girl two years younger than me needed help with her math homework. She didn't understand her homework, so I helped her because I understood the homework. Helping people with the things they are confused in makes you a leader. It makes you a leader, because you are the person guiding them through. For Instance, My friend Generic_Name didn't know what to do in her project, so her classmate that went to homework club with her, helped her with the project. He knew how to do the project, so he helped her. Helping other people could also help you with your social skills because you are communicating with other students. You are communicating with the other person and helping them, which plays a role in your social skills, especially in the future when you have a job.

""OMG!"" exclaimed Generic_Name, ""I can't believe it!"". ""What Happened?"" asked Generic_Name. ""I have an A+ in all my classes!"" said Generic_Name. ""Congratulations!"" said Generic_Name. ""Thank you! It took a lot of hard work and patience,"" said Generic_Name. ""Really, what did you do?"" asked Generic_Name. ""Well I joined the homework club like you said,"" said Generic_Name. ""Thats wonderful,"" said Generic_Name. ""I finished my homework, missing assignments, and I understand the things I was confused in,"" said Generic_Name. ""Thats cool,"" said Generic_Name. ""I met a lot of new people there, and I helped them to,"" said Generic_Name. ""I also stopped procrastinating like I used to. I learned this cool trick on how to stop procrastinating,"" said Generic_Name proudly. ""I'm so happy for you!"" said Generic_Name. Being more cooperative in class,finishing any missing assignments, and helping other students are all benefits of joining the homework club. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

It let's you do things when your not doing anything to pass time. can pass time by doing something you like. taking time out of your day to help someone with something is good you win they win we all win. having something to take the stress off your mind is always good. taking time to enjoy while you are young and do fun things while also learning things that may help you in your future.

sports,sports can help you receive stress and take your mind off of what ever thats you have to worry about at school. you have more responsibilities to take care of because your more focused about the the sport then whats going on at school. more students are stressed about school then anything else. sports or anything other extracurricular activity may take the stress away from school or from any type of stress. also having extracurricular activities have a part thats bad about it. being to focused on the sport may bring your grades down. having two types or responsibilities. you have to get homework done and you have sports to focus on if your going to do any extracurricular activities make sure you have a plan to get everything done in the time you have.

Student counseling helping any student with the problems that they have and sort things out. Is a good idea as that the student knows how life is different and know how things are. It can help a lot of students and more comfortable with them cause they might be friends. they are going to be comfortable with their friend talking to about the problem . They also may make things worse if there not professional and what their doing, It might make the situation worse if they say anything bad about it or they might just not like it. also that its an extracurricular activity

having all these extracurricular activities could change things for people to be out there and communicating with other students. help them relief stress from all the work that is due and focus on the extracurricular activity that they are doing. when they are back to school they are less stressed and ready to focus in class. looking forward to making new friends when other people join and can trust them. having a sport a year book club or anything you cant always focus on the sport or club, you have to focus on school and in the sport or club.

Imagine bein a student you have homework, chores and if you have little siblings you might have to watch them. Your stressed, overworked and pressured to do better. It is time comsuming and you have little relaxation now with this new rule you have even more to do. Your being forced to take up a club. Keeping that in mind do you really think its good to force student to take up a club with all of their prexisting responsibillitys? If your not convinced think aout what kind of clubs you have. Do you think each student, each indivdual will like your limted choces?

Students have countless tasks with homework, chores and taking care of siblings. Students do not get much time for themselves. With so little time to relax they become overworked and stressed which is bad for productivity taking up a club gives them even less time to relax. Student grades can and probibly will sufer with this kind of change.

Although many schools have all sorts of diffrent clubs with such a wide and diverse student population it can be hard to please them all. No doubt you will have students whos intrests do not line up with the clubs you have makeing them to join a club they dislike insted. Imagine all of your clubs are sports related with socer, baseball, football, basketball, track, ect and you have a student who hates sports you can not make an exeption to the rule so what do you do? The only choice there can be is to make the student take up something they hate which can cause acting out from the student as they try to get out of the club.

Now some may argue saying schools have enough clubs to satisfy everyone. This may be true but I would imagine you have over one hundred students or even with just one hunded students you would be pushing the limit of how many students one techer can watch not to mention the teacher dose not get paid to watch students after school. They may also have children of their own they need to take care of. Another posible arguement is that a club builds confidence and I would agree but students could very well dislike being told to do an activity and if they dislike it alredy it will not end well.

Clubs are fun and enriching but should never be forced onto someone. Now I have given my side I pose the qusetion to you, do you still think its a good idea to force a club on students? My answer is no and I hope yours is the same. This rule is only going to do more harm than good.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
EC8040CEB1E1,"Although extracurricular activities are great they should not be mandatory. Sports and clubs can be wonderful, but there is always a downside. Some children just don't have time. That is why I disagree with the principal because not all kids can do extracurricular activities.

Children just don't have time for extra things in their lives. Some children don't get home until very late at night because their parents work late. It's not their faults, but making extracurricular's mandatory is putting more stress on parents too. When some students get home they have hours of homework to do. Homework can make you stay up extremely late and that can make you tired for school the next day.

A lot of students have extra work around the house that they have to do when they get home. Some students have to do chores that take hours. Students have to cook dinner,clean, and babysit. Doing chores,homework,and a extracurricular activity would be too much stress for a child. If the children had to do all of that they would never end up going to bed!

There are some students who don't work well in groups. Forcing that on them would just make them feel worse. Some children have horrible anxiety and working in groups can make them afraid. I know from experience that when children that suffer from anxiety have to do something they feel they can't they will have a panic attack. That is something that is very hard to deal with and when they go into that state you can't get them out, you just have to comfort them. That is why I personally think you shouldn't force kids into activities.

Students need to be reassured that they have a choice because being forced into something is never enjoyable especially since we're teenagers. We don't like to listen and usually do the opposite of what we get told to do. Giving us the decision of if we want to do extracurricular activities or not will give us responsibility.

628D02AAB498,"Making all students participate in a extracurricular activity is a horrible idea! Some people might agree that all students should participate in a extracurricular activity but I disagree because not all students have the time to participate in activities at school. Some students have jobs, activities out side of school, and other responsibilities.

Let me start by saying making all students participate in a extracurricular activity in school is not a very bright idea! Some students have jobs and they might not have the time to participate in activities at school. For example, my oldest sister Generic_Name was on the cheer team and she also had a job but she had to quit the cheer team because her job hours and practice time was interfering.

Another reason I disagree with making all students participate in a extracurricular activity in school is because some students participate in activities out side of school. When they get home they have to get ready to go to practice so they wouldÃÂ´t have time to participate in a activity at school. Like when I was on the dance team and I wanted to do track but I couldnÃÂ´t because when I got home from school it was time for me to get ready for dance practice and track practice was at the same time as dance practice. This is why I disagree with making all students participate in a activity at school because not all students have the time.

Final reason why I disagree with this statement is because some students have responsibilities when they get home. They might have to get their younger sibling off the bus, babysit, or even clean the house. If they donÃÂ´t handel their responsibilities they might get in trouble or worst. One time my sister got in a lot of trouble because she was supposed to get me off the bus and she didnÃÂ´t because she stayed back for basketball.

In conclusion, making all students participate in a extracurricular activity at school is not a very bright idea.

AE9E8ACD0A6F,"Does your school principal ever make you participate in after school activities?

If so, do you think it is fair? Well, I don't think it is fair, because, first of all, it takes away students' free time. After school programs not only take away free time, it also takes away time for students to do their homework and schoolwork. Secondly, if you have an upcoming test, and you don't have time to study if you want to get to bed at a decent hour, then you shouldn't have to do an after school program, otherwise, your activity should be canceled. Like, for instance, if you have an SOL the next day and you attend your after school activity because it wasn't called off, then you might not get the sleep you need for the test because you got home late, and couldn't study. It's good to have a fresh mind when you wake up in the morning, as well as a good breakfast.

If some students play sports, it will make them late for practices and games. Additionally, if you are a bit competitive and you play against someone during your activity, it could cause a lot more fights and even school suspension, if it goes too far. Students shouldn't be forced to do something that they don't want to do. Some students even like to go out to dinner with family and friends. Also, if they have lots of schoolwork to catch up on and their activity takes away their time to make it up, it can put pressure on students' when their work just piles up even more. For those reasons, after school activities should be eliminated for all schools. It can also take away students attention in class and cause them to lose focus, as well as, cause learning disabilities because they don't have the time to learn it in class. Stress can also cause students to want to miss school because they are overwhelmed with school work. If students don't want to participate, then don't force them.

After a long day at school, students like to go home and relax a while, but these after school programs that you are, supposedly required to attend to, take away that privilege. The schools need to realize how important free time is for students. Free time can also help with communication and interaction with friends. Students need to be aware of new responsibilities to prepare them for adult life. Growing up is hard to do and attending after school activities, only makes things harder because of the attention they are forced to put on their program. These reasons should be thought about and discussed before they decide on rather or not, after school activities is a good thing.          ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
29F5457E7E90,"Many people might think that taking part in extracurricular activities is a waste of time. However, it could be the one thing that can take people out into the world of different hobbies and opportunities. Extracurricular activities can be greatly beneficial in so many ways. For example, students can explore different hobbies that may be of interest to them and students can make lots of new friends as well. Students also gain a lot of experience that they can carry over into their everyday lives; there really isn't a downside to participating in after school activities! Participating in extracurricular activities can be beneficial, for it will help students make new friends and learn new hobbies and skills.

Making new friends is only one of the positive outcomes of having students participate in after school activities. In this modern age you don't need facts and statistics to tell teachers and staff that many students these days are suffering from bullying, cyber bullying, and loneliness. There are lot's of kids out there that don't feel like they will ever fit in with the rest of the students. Although it may seem nice to blend in with everyone else, everyone is different in their own unique way. This should be celebrated and not ridiculed. Therefore, joining after school activities and making friends that have the same interest as you can really be beneficial. When a student joins a club or sport that appeals to them, they will inevitably be surrounded by other classmates that have the same interests as them. When people are around others that have the same interests it often leads to friendships.

Joining after school activities could also cut down on bullying, for students could worry more about their friendships rather than focusing on bullying somebody else which could be very beneficial for students. It could help them focus more on their new friends and school work rather than the bully that's waiting for them down the hall. Making new friends isn't the only positive outcome of participating in extracurricular activities. Learning about new hobbies and skills is another positive effect as well.

A wonderful result of joining extracurricular activities is that students can learn about new hobbies and skills. There are so many amazing hobbies and activities out there that many students haven't even heard of, and this is where after schools clubs and activities come into play. Students have the opportunity to learn about and experience vastly different subjects that they may not get the time to do elsewhere. Some clubs even teach students valuable lessons about how to cook healthy meals for themselves, appreciate different cultures around the globe, and even community service. All of these different clubs offer valuable lessons and skills that students can carry over into their everyday lives and even when they grow older. It's truly amazing what these clubs have to offer. In fact, another reason is that there may be students that come from lower class families that don't have the opportunity to participate in sports and other leisurely activities. With after school activities students can have the opportunity to experience all of those amazing activities without cost. Extracurricular activities can give students so many amazing experiences and skills that they can carry with them for the rest of their lives.

Extracurricular activities can be really beneficial for students, for students get to make new friends and learn about new hobbies and skills. Making friends can help students by making them feel more included and like they belong. Furthermore, it could also cut down on bullying in schools. Learning about different hobbies and skills is beneficial because it can teach students valuable lessons and expand their interests. In the end, extracurricular activities should be a requirement in all schools because of how beneficial they can be to students. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
A5DA0D5410DE,"My principal recently decided that all students should participate in an extra curricular activity, and I totally agree. I think every student should participate in an activity like sports, a musical in s trument class, or some sort of club. This would help students to learn and develop talents and skills. Also it would give students a time to socialize with people. So, I think the principals's idea was great and it helps students learn and grow and gives time to socialize.

If students do after schools activities like sports they will be able to exercise and practice coordination with friends. Sports will make students to grow to strong and get lots of sunlight. Learning an instrument has been proven to make people smarter. But not just in music, in other curriculum too. Also there is a lot of different clubs out there that can help people with getting jobs or just learn a hobbie too.

One big thing that I will really like about this is that it gives students more time to socialize mwith friends. This will also give practice of big social skills you will use through your life. These skill will help get jobs for students later in their life. With an extra hour or two to spend time with peers and teachers they will get alot of practice. But most of all give students a fun time after spending all their day at school.

So in conclusion, the principals decision on students participating in extra curricular activities would good for me and my peers. It will give students time to develop and grow their skills, like coordination, knowledge of a topic or hobbies. Also it would give students time to socialize, grow social skills and have fun. So in the end the principals decision is great. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
B1D7630EE532,"I like this idea a lot. It would be a good way for students to make new friends and find an activity that they enjoy. Some students might not like it because it would take time away from doing other things. Even though kids should already be doing activities or sports. A lot of kids will just sit around and watch Netflix after school. This will give them a chance to find something they like to do that is more active. I think that parents would be happy that there child is getting more involved and having fun.

Some people struggle to pay for things like this. So if anyone could give a little extra money for those kids then the teams would be bigger and better. The principle could even make the activities cost little to nothing so that every student could be doing something. If a student isn't participating in a sport then the cost might go up or down, it depends on what they decide.

This could help them in the future like when college's start looking for students. They want students who get involved with things at school and who try there best. So if the students don't participate in anything then there is a slimmer chance of getting into a good school. Once you graduate and start looking for college's it would be harder to find one if your don't participate in activities.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
70ED039EAD61,"Students these days lack extracurricular activity. Mainly kids focus on their main core classes that only serve in those seven hours of school. In my opinion I agree that the school should provide a variety of athletic and academic activities at or after school. I would highly recommend this to all schools. Not only should students be as smart as they are, but that students should have the ability to choose at least one activity that they would love to do.

Everyone expresses themselves in different ways which make them who they are. If my principal ever gave this opportunity to my school then I would be thankful. Since not only can kids be book smart but participating in an extracurricular activity gives them wonderful things to come their way. These activities the school would provide students would give them an extra activity that makes them who they are today. Students by all means deserve this so they can express themselves to other people and make an impact.

I believe every student would wish to just come home from school and lay in bed while they watch TV or play on their phone. This should not be the case although this situation happens everyday.

Instead of looking forward to watching your favorite show when you get home from school look forward to something totally different. People are getting more and more lazy and I'm sure the school could agree as well. Providing these extra activities will prevent students from being lazy which would help themselves.

When students participate in these activities it not only helps themselves but different schools and colleges look at that in your applications. You might not realize by doing these activities provided for you help you in the long run. Colleges in different states look for this and are amazed by seeing the things you do in your everyday life. Doing these sports and academic activities that you love doing can even give you a job all about the certain things you love doing everyday. For example my extracurricular activity outside of school is lacrosse which definitely made a gigantic impact on my life and I absolutely adore lacrosse and want to continue doing it in college. Which gives you an example from what you love in life brings you great things in the future.

All students schools should be able to have the chance to express themselves in any way possible. If schools make this decision all staff will get to see a hue change in the students. It is just an overall great and smart decision that schools need to make. From me agreeing with this suggestion I hope new things come our way in our everyday school life!       ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
2FA8056C7201,"Dear Principal of Generic_School,

Recently, you have stated that you will be enforcing a radical and possibly illegal new policy. This new policy will force every student to attend and participate in extracurricular activities. I would urge you to reconsider, here are a few reasons why.

Many of our students that attend this school work jobs. You realistically cannot expect high school students to quit their jobs and stop making income. Especially when that income goes toward paying for college, helping their parents make rent, and supporting their families. Jobs help shape and mold young people, as it is a vital experience that makes them ready for an occupation. However, if you do choose to enforce this policy, many local businesses will suffer from unemployment.

Another reason I am against this policy is that you are forcing students to do something that isn't required. After school programs are a great thing to students who are interested, but not to those who aren't. When you make someone do something against their will, the cons out weigh the pros. Those who aren't willing to learn, won't. As someone who has worked in the public school system, you must know this. You could make the argument that it's practically an extension of school, but it isn't. You cannot legally make students stay after 3:15, nor can you make teachers stay after 3:45. If you enforce this policy, it will only be a matter of time until upset parents will press charges against the school for illegally obtaining children.

The biggest reason why this policy would not be viable, is our budget. As many of us students know, our school system is not in a safe financial state. We are already on a tight budget, and expanding our extracurricular programs to serve around 400 more people doesn't make sense. Especially now, when we are spending thousands of dollars to prepare for a global pandemic that has already brought many schools around us to their knees. It is clearly not the time to waste our money on something we would possibly get sued for enforcing, instead of spending it on something we need.

This letter contains just a few reasons why I am against it. From unemployment to the legality, I hope I have changed your mind on this subject. And if not, I would surely wish you would be open to compromise.

With concern,

C7373B980F7E,"Why call it extracurricular when you are required to do it? I disagree that you have to stay after school because what if you have a job,parents are divorced ,have no time to chill with friends, and if you have to walk home with your siblings.

What if you have a job then you would not be able to sat after. The reason why you can't stay after is if you have a job you have to get ready, you have to take a shower. You might even have to do choirs if your parents give you some when you come home from school then you have to leave for work and on top of that you might have to do homework.

What if your parents are divorced. If your parents are divorced then then you might not be able to see your mom and your dad as much. Without being able to see your parents as much that will leave you and your parents depressed do to the mental health problems that occurs when your parents divorce.

If you are required to stay after school then you wont have as much time to hang out with your friends. When you are at school for so long you get anxious because all you are doing is traveling to room to room all day then they add even more time to the day its just bound to have more frequent fights. But not only that you dont get to see your friends as much because by the time you are getting home its becoming dark outside.

When you have to stay after you can't walk your siblings to your house. The nice thing about getting off ealer then the elementary school kids is when you get out of school you can walk to there school then wait for your siblings. But if you are required to stay after school then you cant walk them to the house which would mean that they would walk by them self or a parent would have to quit there job to make sure there child gets home safely.

In conclusion, You should not make it required to stay after school because we might have a job,parents that are divorced,wont have much time to chill, and our siblings might have to walk there house by them self. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
B42AFC74C063,"Students should be allowed to make their own decisions and to not be forced into doing any activities others choose for them or make them do. If they are unable to cooperate physically and/or don't have the right type of mindset they should not participate. Not having that compatibility with certain subjects that others may have might be challenging for others to look forward to. It would be enticing to do these events but if you don't have many ideas for these things, it's disappointing. People would really look forward to those plans but when you lack skills it is hard.

Sports festivals will need pros who can win in any games or peoples they face up against. In ""Work on the yearbook"" section you will need skills of editing, drawing arts and photography. Last for student council you will need lots of ideas and ways to help the community and plan events. For those events and activities people will need time to do so, If you are unable to have that time nor someone to pick you up from those things then it's harsh to find someone who is willing to do so. You will need a family member or a close friend who can drive because these events may carry on longer then school buses can manage to take you home.

These activities that you may force on us may be a good thing in your head and to some other people but when you come back to reality there's a bigger picture. All these plans you want us to have to do is very tiring and time consuming, many people may not have the capabilities to do so. Finding the right time, ideas and perfectly cut out people for the job is extremely hard. This may not be as easy as it seams especially for the young and maturing as they're still trying to figure out paths they want to go down for the future, and how their brains are still developing. Students shouldn't have to participte if they are not willing to. Leave the choice up to them. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
EB793B72A8C4,"Extracurricular activities are important for students, and I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students should try something new instead of doing nothing. Students can gain a lot from this experience, so I believe that they should participate in them. I think that even if students don't want to participate in these activities, they should because they can learn things that they never knew before, and I think that it could make an impact on their lives. Extracurricular activities are good for students to participate in because they can give you something to do, they can help you meet and befriend new people, and they can help kids find potential ideas and hobbies.

Extracurricular activities can give you something to do. Some of my friends go home and do nothing after school. It can get boring to have nothing to do for the remainder of the day. Participating in an after-school activity can pass time and help you to not be bored, especially if you are participating in an activity you enjoy. When I was in elementary school, I went to an after-school art club so I could pass the time doing something that I liked. I also did after-school soccer in the fourth grade, and I started playing volleyball in the fourth grade. I am still playing volleyball to this day. These kinds of activities can give you something to do instead of going on your phone and doing nothing. I have gotten more productive over the past couple of years because I participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that kids can be more productive, and extracurricular activities are a vital way to achieve this goal. Not only is it a good way to spend your time, but it is also a good way to meet people.

Extracurricular activities are a good way to socialize with people because you are participating in activities and games that you enjoy with other people. You share the same interests, and liking the same things as someone else is a good way to bond and socialize with people. I met a lot of people through after-school volleyball, and I am still friends with most of them to this day. Our team would go out to restaurants after our games whether we won or lost because we were friends, and we liked to play together. We all liked playing the sport, so it was easy to make friends with each other. I also met a lot of people through my art club because we liked to draw, and we liked to talk to each other. If you have trouble making friends, you will most likely be able to socialize and bond with others through these events. I met one of my best friends through after-school dance classes when I was in elementary school. We enjoy dancing and listening to music together. Not only are extracurricular activities able to help you get to know people, but they can also help you find your interests.

Having schools require students to take at least one extracurricular activity can help them find hobbies, and they can help students find things that they didn't know they were interested in. For example, I once convinced my sister to play volleyball. She didn't really want to do it. After school that day, she came to our volleyball practice. She ended up loving the sport, and she also plays it to this day. There are many different activities, such as theater, art, sports, science and math clubs, and the student council. Students are most likely going to find an activity they like and stick with it as they get older. Doing an activity that you enjoy can be very entertaining, and you might keep doing it in the future. I am in my school's eighth grade chorus, and I want to continue this activity as I get into high school. If you really enjoy these activities at school, you might also try to practice them at home. If you like to go to an art club at your school, you might continue to draw at home. These activities can also lead to trying to improve in your hobby as well. I continue to draw at home so I can improve. Schools give access to these potential new hobbies and activities, and I think that students should go to them and give them a chance.

In conclusion, I believe that students should be required to take at least one extracurricular activity. It is something that I believe is crucial to who students grow up to be. If students join an after-school activity, they can become more responsible. Having them sit around all day can make that person lazy in the future. They not might want to try new things in the future because they were raised that way. Giving kids these potential interests can help impact their choices in life, such as what they want to do for a job or what they want to do for a hobby. People might already have their future planned, but joining an extracurricular activity can change their views and can give them new ideas. Overall, I think that extracurricular activities are a good way for students and kids to spend their time participating in and enjoying. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
25FCAC7AE925,"I personally think every kid should do some sort of extracurricular activity,for one the activities could help them find new friends,they can look good on college resumes,and all around make the persons' school experience better. The first reason is that extracurricular activities can help students find new friends. This is what happens normally when playing sports,because everyone playing that sport has to play as a team. The next example is that participating in an extracurricular activity can look good on college resumes. If you play a sport or are in a club and stay committed to it, that is what colleges look for. The last example is the activities someone takes part in,can help them through the rest of the year. Clubs or participating on school council can make your year more interesting,because you almost always have something to look forward to.

The first part of my examples I want to talk about, is that the activity you pick can possibly assist you in finding a new friend. For instance if you play a sport,then that means you play with at least 10 other people. Therefore you will have to work as a team,or else you guys wouldn't win much. That is why there is practices,because the coaches are trying to get you and your teammates used to playing alongside each other. You start to know each other better and better as the season goes on and by the end of the year,a person you played with could become a close friend. Another example would be if you are in a school club, you will work along side others which could spark a friendship down the line. This is also the case when you are on student council you work with others for a lot of if not the whole year. Besides those examples there are so many more extracurricular activities that could help you find new friends. That was multiple reasons how you could make new friends during extracurricular activities.

The second point I have stated could be the most important in someone's life,the example is that if you participate in any sort of activity for your school would look good on your college resume. This is a great example of why you should do extracurricular things in school, and stay committed with it. For example if you play football for your whole high school and middle school career and stay with it,in turn colleges will see that you were physically and mentally committed to something and possibly could accept you. Therefore if there are bigger colleges wanting to accept you,where if you graduate it could turn into a very good paying job,you have a great future ahead of you. Those were just a few of my reasonings why extracurricular activities would look good on college resumes.

The third and final example of why you should do extra activities for your school is it can make your whole school experience better. Specifically in sports when you have a game on a school day. When you get to the school in the morning on game day it goes by really quick,because you have something you are looking forward to do. This can also happen when you have a club party,fundraisers,or any special event for your club or sport. In any instance you are looking forward to having fun out of school with your classmates/club members or your teammates. That is also another great place to make friends whether its a chill hang out with your teammates or it is a special event for your club you still can make friends in either situation,which could lead to you and your new friend to hang out more in school, that would also make the school day more enjoyable. Those were my reasons why people should do activities so it could make them like school more.

People should participate in extracurricular activities because they can,make new friends,have a good college resume,and make school a lot more enjoyable. The first reason is so they can make new friends,which this happens in any kind of activity you do. The second is it would look good on a college resume,more clubs you join the more colleges look at you. The third and final reason is so it can make school more fun and enjoyable,it can be because you made a new friend or if you are waiting on a special event. The whole idea of school is to set yourself up for success and joining clubs,doing sports or any other activity can help you in doing that. Granted you might not make it in the best college but at least you won't regret doing the extracurricular activities you did and had fun doing them.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
1C29F0363194,"Are you passionate about chess, football, or debate? Luckily, most schools have clubs for those activities. Extracurricular activities are very helpful in the success and improvement of students. All students should be required to do one or more extracurricular activities. When doing and extracurricular activity, students can learn new skills, meet new people, and grow awareness for a cause, issue, or group.

Students want to learn about things outside of what they're testing for, and extracurricular activities are the perfect opportunity to do that. There are activities where you can learn to bake, sew, play chess, play basketball, or even learn about other countries and cultures. Students should be required to learn skills outside of History, English, Math, or Science. Students should have more opportunities to learn about life outside of those subjects. Adults might not use polynomials or graphs every day, but they most likely cook every day, so students should have an opportunity to learn how to cook.

Another reason extracurricular activities should be required because you can meet new people. When I first moved to Virginia I didn't know anyone, I was scared and didn't have any friends. By doing extracurricular activities, I found a great group of friends that are passionate about the same things I am. One of my friends recently tried out for our school play, she got in, and now she is much closer with everyone involved in the play. After spending many weekends and days after school in the drama department, she made many new friends and grew closer with old friends too.

Extracurricular activities also grow awareness for illnesses or groups. If it weren't for fundraisers, I wouldn't know about illnesses like ovarian cancer, or dementia. Many schools also have a diversity club where students can raise awareness about different cultures and embrace their differences. Diversity club can ensure people that it's okay to be different and that no one is the exact same. Through the partners program at my school, I learned that special needs people are still people and that you should treat them with the same respect you would give anyone else.

All in all, Some people think that we shouldn't be required to do an extracurricular activity, but I disagree. I think that all students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities teach students new skills, like chess, help students make new friends, and grow awareness for many issues. You can contact your principle, via email or call him/her, and tell him/her that extracurricular activities should be a requirement. Extracurricular activities are important, and help not only me, but others improve as well.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
07AB5218B889,"Would you believe that my principal, the proud representative of Generic_School Middle School is choosing to force students to stay after school for no less than one activities regardless of my or any other kids feelings? Sadly you would have to believe me because that is the truth. Instead of implementing a beneficial policy to school grounds our principal choose to take away students freedoms. I know for a fact that other students feel the way I do. I believe that this is a complete mistake making this decision because, it adds to the mountains of stress students already receive, it will conflict with students interests, and the idea that this is forced upon students is something that will not make us proud or happy to go to Generic_School.

One of the major reasons why this is a terrible policy is the amount of stress that participating in an extracurricular will add. Students already have large amounts of stress due to balancing homework, projects, studying for tests, S.O.L's, and getting enough sleep every night. Also, if students stay after for a club there interested in there is no guarantee everyone in that group is as nice as you. Teens can be major jerks and sometimes can put you in an bad situation. I wouldnt want to be forced to stay after school in an unsafe and uncomfortable environment. I have stayed after school many times and it has not been enjoyable, theres always at least one kid that has an issue with everyone that looks at him/her. A mandatory policy like this increases the number of opportunities for bullying to ac cure. I wouldnt want to be forced to stay after school in an unsafe and uncomfortable environment.

Another crucial reason why this policy should not be instated is the conflict with students interests, outside of school, it will have. Students have many interests outside of school, if another activity were to be forced onto them it would affect there current schedules massively. I am currently participating in four activities outside of school, an additional one would through me off completely. A lot of kids including myself have a bit of a routine on a daily basis, this policy will mess up my routine. Also, what if there are know clubs/activities that a student is interested in?. Are they supposed to just tough it out and waste two hours their time doing something they dont enjoy. After school programs last from 2:30 to 4:30. Sometimes I get dropped off at my stop at 6:30 and in the winter its dark out by then. That leaves me maybe an hour of homework if i'm lucky, because I most likely already have something going on. As it is the school grading system is unfair, because if someones writing is truly brilliant but they did not follow the rubric the will get an F, While somebody whos writing is very dull and boring will get an A. The last thing students need is less time to do schoolwork.

My third and final point on why this policy is a big mistake is the fact that this is forced upon us. If theres one thing Teenagers dont like its got to be rules that limit what they can do. It is nice having the option to stay after, I would not to be forced to do so. A policy that has been instated at Generic_School is the phone policy. It states that kids mayn not be on there mobile device at all during the school day, this has increased the number of students using there phones, even more people than before the policy. The reason why teens shoplift is because its taboo, there forced to not steal, so they then steal. A country in south America is experimenting with a new law were cocaine is legal. It has actually decreased the amount of people using it, by making it legal it gave people less pf a reason to do it. My point is that if students were forced to stay after it would cause rebellion and protest and negative attitudes among the students.

In conclusion, A policy that forces students to participate in at least one extracurricular is a tremendous mistake because it will negatively impact students by adding to there stress, conflicting with there interests outside of school, and forcing this upon them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
2E810318FBD2,"Your principal has decided that all student's must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

I do agree that student's should at least do one activity like help work on the year book's, sports,student council, etc. If i had to pick one activity it would be student council because i can help people like if their going through tough times. Say if they have trouble in school, try to help them with there grade's, or maybe the lost a love one. I would convince other to support me because i listen to people about what wrong or if there going thought something. I care about people feelings and i won't say anything in till there done.

Why do i want to do this is because say if your mom,dad,granddad, or grandma die in a car crush wouldn you be upset because that's your family member or maybe they die of the corona would you be upset you would want a councilor, brother, or sister. What i'm trying to say is that people need a council to help them out. Ok say that a truck smash your house wouldn't you be in shock in that case you would need a council right.

What i trying to say is that i want people to support me to do what i want to do, like say i want to help people out through family problem or like a love one die of cancer, heart attack, car crush, etc. I would be there to help them through there problem. it would be my honor to help people out.

C0AF81E21678,"Would students rather be sitting at home doing nothing or would they rather be doing something fun at school? Well the principal has decided to make everyone at Generic_School participate in an extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision; students shouldn't be sitting doing nothing they should be out having fun. I think this because an activity would be a great way for children to meet friends and find something they are interested in.

Participating in an activity might help kids make new friends. Kids might not have many friends at school; therefore, if they went to an activity they could meet some new people. Last year in seventh grade I didn't have many friends. My best friend moved and I was going to a new school with a lot more people. One of my friends at school said they were signing up to be in Best Buddies; so I decided to sign up too. We became close to one of the buddies and now we all are friends do stuff outside of school. Also, children might not have any of their friends in their classes. Generic_School is very big and has many class rooms. The chance of get in a class with a friend is low. Last summer I was very nervous about not having any classes with friends. When school started I only had one class with a friend, but we didn't even get to sit next to each other. I didn't get to spend time with my friends until after school at Best Buddies. During that time I also made a new friend. Another reason is because kids might be shy and not able make friends during the day. I have always been a shy kid and when I didn't have any classes with my friends I kept to myself even more. Best Buddies gave me a chance to have fun and interact with more people. This year I still go to Best Buddies, and I am still good friends with the people I meet last year. Making friends can be hard at times, but going to an extracurricular activity could help.

Going to an extracurricular activity could help a student find something they are interested in. The activity they choose might be something they could do in high school. For example, when Generic_School's eighth graders went to visit the high school; they had a bunch of tables around the gym. At each table there were teenagers showing all of the extracurricular activities they had there. I signed up for Best Buddies because I really enjoyed it this year and last year. Also, the activity that a student picks might influence their decision on what they want to do when the grow up. For instance, I had always wanted to be a doctor when I grow up, but going to Best Buddies slightly changed my mind. Spending time with all the kids at Best Buddies, and helping them made me want to change what I wanted to be. Instead of being just a regular doctor, I now want to be a doctor for kids. Last, but not least, a student might like an activity so much that they want to do it outside of school. I enjoyed Best Buddies so much last year that I did it again this year! Last year my friend and I went to the movies to go see

""The Lion King""

with our buddy on the weekend. I also invited him to my birthday party and he invited me to his. Participating in an activity might help a child find a hobby or even something they would like to do in the future.

Overall, I support the principals decision, and think that everyone at school should be in an extracurricular activity. Not only can an activity help a student meet a new friend, they could also find something they are interested in. Instead of kids being board at home, they could be at an extracurricular activity having fun!  ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
19FDE7E48C74,"Extracurricular activities are a way for students to express their interests, build relationships with their peers, and be active in their school community. Unfortunately, the school day and homework take up a large portion of the day, and not all students have the time or energy to participate in optional activities. There might be pressure from people at home or at school to preform well in a specific activity, or the school might not offer a program that fits the interests or needs of a student. Even though downsides are apparent, is there enough positive aspects to extracurricular activities that they should be required?

At Generic_School, there is a wide variety of activities and clubs offered for students from grades seven through twelve. Many students are able to find a club that they enjoy, and make attending that activity a part of their weekly routine. However, there are some students who just can't find the right club for them, or don't have the motivation. Sometimes they are busy with other activities outside of school such as sports or practicing a hobby, and they can't find any room in their schedule for more activities. Requiring everybody to participate in extracurricular activities would give some students the motivation they need to find a club that they really enjoy, but it could also force others to give up an aspect of their routine at home so they could have time to participate in activities at school. This would be especially devastating to a student who is training hard to become an athlete, or practicing a hobby they really enjoy, because they would have to give that up to choose from a variety of activities that they may have no interest in participating in.

Extracurricular activities can be very productive and enjoyable for any student, but only in the right setting. When a student decides that they want to commit to a club, they are more likely to work hard and enjoy themselves while participating. A student whose parent or principal tells them they must participate won't enjoy themselves, and will probably make the experience worse for everyone else around them. While an unmotivated student is wasting time in a club, they could be exploring an interest at home, or developing a skill set that one day could turn into their career. A student might select yearbook, but have no interest in journalism. A student could choose to participate in the student government, but not have any ideas for the school. While they aren't being productive, there could be another student who was denied a spot in their favorite program, all because someone who wasn't interested in the topic was required to sign up. Requiring extracurricular activities could take time away from productive activities elsewhere, and deny passionate students a chance at their dreams.

Students should all have a chance to be an active member of their school community, and have the freedom to choose what they participate in. Not everyone is aware the benefits of participating in extracurricular programs, and schools should make the student body aware of them, but they should not be required. Schools could encourage participation by offering a variety of activities, getting feedback from students on what needs to change, and advertising that extracurricular activities can be a fun way to meet new people, and learn more about a subject you're interested in. Providing students with a way to expand their knowledge and practice something they find interesting is a great way to inspire them to work hard. As soon as it becomes a requirement, students will begin to loose interest. Schools need to strongly encourage extracurricular activities, but not require them.               ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
AA9767FB71E9,"Think about the activities you participated in as a grade school student. This could have been sports, writing for the schools paper, or simply participating in the PTA meetings the county set up. Now some students choose not to participate in these activities, and it can set them up for failure farther into the future. All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it encourages them to be more socially and physically active, and may help the students uncover new hobbies.

Participating in activities outside of school would help students build relationships and bond socially. Studies have shown that being more socially active is good for your body and mind; however some students aren't given the opportunity to become a social butterfly, and this can take a big toll on their life. When a student is anti-social they have an increased risk of sinking into depression, but participating in social activities from a young age outside of school can make it easier for students to make friends in the future.

It is important for students to get outside and exercise often, and playing sports outside of school is a great way to do so. Sports are examples of complex social activities, and they encourage students to be both physically and social active. Students can find a joy and passion for the sport they play, and when they do they begin to feel better about themselves.

Many students choose to enter journalism or creative writing, and some might discover that this is what they enjoy. Other students could enjoy rocketry or chemistry, and find that they enjoy that more than writing. This can all be accomplished by engaging in after school activities, that way the students could discover new hobbies that they might carry on through high school and college.

In conclusion, students who participate in extracurricular activities can find themselves entranced by new hobbies, learn to love a sport, and make friends easier. Students should always be encouraged to participate in after school activities to increase their emotional and social health. Given the chance, they could become the next big rocket scientist.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
DA06C685218C,"I disagree with the principal beacuase no one should be forced to do anything that they dont want to to.

Students are sometimes lazy,so they dont want to do anything. so they just stay home and,play video games all day. when stay home all day all day everyday,that's how we as kids get over weight. on ther hand the principal can have his opinion. his opoinion wont matter because everyone has a choice.

what makes him think that he can fust force people to do stuff. no,no you can only control yourself. students have a good mind of there own. so students do what they think is best,and do what they want to do. students can follow the principals advice or dont follow his advice.

students ingeneral would love to have fun wile other's just want to eat and play video games. that's there choice like i said they have a great impact in life by what choices they make becuase it is hard sometimes. so dont let kids think that they can just do what you want them to do let them choose.

students get older and there mind is developing as they get older. so if the principal puts so much preasure on the kids he is also damageing there mind. and when i mean damageing i mean he is brainwashing there mind..now kids have a mind of ther own,some other's get brainwashed. when they get brainwashed they also lose there self,and they get out of control.

some kids have it hard in life,and i think it is wrong for the principal to put so much preasure on kids. for what beacuse he wants them to choose a sport,extracurricular activity. it should'nt matter if they da s activity or not they get to choose. you dont have to do activities if you dont want to. activities are just a thing that is extra.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

Dear students of Generic_School , I think that the our principal Mr. Generic_Name should be enforcing that we participate in at least one extracurricular activity this year.

Participating in something that is fun and can help you with your everyday day to day life , we should strive to want . For example , there are people in Asia , Africa , and India that are not able to go to school and would die if they were able to do the fun things that we get to do , that is why we should want to participate in fun things that can benefit you and your community .

My pawpaw once said that , "" If a opertuntity is thrown at you catch that opertunuty and create new and better opertunitys , and we should be doing just that . People are getting mad at Mr. Generic_Name and are leaving rude messages to the school saying , ""my kid should not have to participate if they dont want to"" , but what they dont see is that Mr. Generic_Name is creating new opertuntiy for you and setting you up for life . participating in activities with the school is helping everybody out weather they see it or not , we are learning new things that will stick with you forever.

When I was in 6th grade at Generic_School ,I joined FFA and I was staying after one Friday were I met a girl named Generic_Name , she let me come into her group and be one of there friends and now we all are super close. That is why participating in activities at your school can be beneficial to you and other people around you . Doing things with your school can help everybody out . For instance look at me and that group of girls I met staying after school 2 years ago , we are all great friends and hang out all the time and if it was not for the school having activities who know the friend I would have .

Participating can play a key roll in your life and can make you and shape you into a better person . If you thought before that you should not partiipate and that paticiapting in activitys were boring , I hope you change your mind and go about the new changes with a positvie aditude .

I dont think that the principle should be able to make the students do an extracurricular activity that they dont want to do or like doing and if they dont want to they shouldnt have to maybe if they like doing student council, sports or working on the schools yearbook then they can.

One of the main reasons i say that students should be able to choose whether or not they do an extracurricular activity is because if the principle makes the student do an extracurricular activity that the student doesnt like and if there is some other students that actually want to do that activity what ever that might be it might be full of kids already so the kids that actually want to do that activity he or she cant do that now because the class might be full and there is a kid in there that doesnt even want to do the activitty he or she got put in.

Its just smarter in general because theres also the kids that will complain about anything and if u just let them choose what ever activity they want to be in they can thats if they even want to be in anything if not then they just dont do any sports, student council or working on the schools yearbook but i definetley dont think that the principle should be able to choose what u do in school just like u get to pick your classes most the time but if they are full then u get other choices.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
57C5D1B5D26B,"What if out of the nowhere a person had to go out of their way to do something that wasn't needed? Wouldn't they be outraged and confused being forced into something that they know isn't necessary? So if this was implemented on a full scale of students wouldn't it fall apart completely. Knowing that the rule that would force students to do extracurricular activities could end up hurting the children and damaging the school, shouldn't it go away.

A school should support helping kids make their own decisions, but if they force them to make one it only hurts them and their growth. When someone constantly holds your hand and guides you to a choice it isn't possible to grow and learn. If they choose to hold their students hands throughout their schooling, how will they be able to grow and progress. If the children are forced into certain activities they won't be able to learn for themselves and become dependent on others. This can be shown in some schools were students pay others to write essay's for them but then fail their tests because nobody could help them. Also, it could ruin several students ability to manage their time if the principal forces them toward a activity. If a student who has a busy life gets more pressure on them they may give up on their grades. If they aren't able to manage their time on top of the activity, they won't be able to excel like how schools wants the students to. An example of this can be seen anywhere because if too much pressure is put on anyone they can get anxiety or depression from the stress. Lastly, it gives more stress on certain students because of the unfamiliar environment. If a child who is bad at interacting with others is forced to spend an upwards of 30 minutes or more a day alone with others it could make them anxious and scared. It would throw students into an unfamiliar place where they don't know anyone and don't even like the activity. This is shown in things like graduation or going to a new school, because teenagers may feel overwhelmed or stressed by the changes in environment. With all the damage the new rule would cause why let it stay in the education system.

It would change the school in many bad ways if this rule was allowed, which is why it can't be allowed to exist in our education. If the rule stays more money will have to go to clubs and activities then usually resulting in lower funds. A decrease in funds will happen since they need to buy more equipment for all clubs like volleyball. With more funds going to clubs it will be harder to improve the building itself and if any damage happens it may not be fixable. Which, is shown in modern capitalism where in order to expand you need to spend more money. Next, it will affect support given to the school. This will happen because if their kids are made to do something that affects them mentally in a bad way their parents will outrage. They would start losing students because the parents wouldn't support the school. This can be shown with things like the corona virus where people started to leave their countries after learning it was unsafe for their families. Last of all, it could affect the sponsors they get. This would happen because the school could start losing parents and kids which would affect how much money they get from sponsors and parents. Sponsors would leave because they no longer think that the school is worth their money since they are losing children and their parents. This can be shown in the stock market, where when funds are in a certain business and the value is going down the sponsors sell their stocks and leave. This would overall permanently damage the school if these events happened, which shows that this policy needs to be rid of.

It is only a waste to make that policy because it ends up hurting the kids and the school. There is no point in keeping this rule if it is just going to hurt everyone around it. So, if this school really cares about itself and its students it should let this activity law be abolished.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
0982F748C034,"I think that everybody should do at least one extracurricular activity, so that everybody has a chance to participate with the school. You don't have to do a certain one, you get to choose which one fits you best you, like you can play sports, you can write or draw, and so much more. Therefore, that means you can enjoy what you pick and not be interested in the activity. Some of these activities help you get into college because some college people come watch you work and see if your talented or not.

If you play sports, it may be hard out there because you have to stay fit you can't be lacking, You can play basketball if you like to shoot hoops at your house or if you just like the concept of it like how people work to together and more. Another sport is football, you may like how people are rough out there and going against each other. There is more but another sport is volleyball, girls can play sports like boys do, they can play softball, basketball, track, soccer and more. So you really have options of what you can do as sport and what you may like.

Some more things is writing and drawing, a lot of people love doing this activity. You may write the newspaper for the school and tell us what going on through out the day and week. Say if you like art you can make painting to show off your artistic part of you, and they might have contests for people to show off there work and college people may be there so o try your hardest. Therefore, that means they might do the same thing with writing, so its your chance to shine bright.

There is so much more you can do, it don't just have to just focus on them two activities, theirs clubs and stuff too. You can join the book club and thats where you read to kids, as a group, or by yourself. Theres an student council where you represent your classmates and come up with ideas for the school. Last but not least there is an drama club where you can express how you feeling by an character.

Basically what i'm saying is yes I do agree that we should have extracurricular activities in our school. It gives people chance to stand bright and show what they can do and what their good at. You have some many options to choose, so why will you just let that fly away. This is your ticket to greatness and to have and go career in the future and to make money. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
8BF8505849C8,"79% of student have a lot of stress because of school work. My friend, Generic_Name would cry to me because of how much school work he has, how unhappy he is, and how he needs a break. I think students should have an extracurricular we don't need to have 79% of student to be dealing with the stuff Generic_Name is dealing.

One of the reason I think student should have an extracurricular is to help calm stress. If a student does work all day then he or she will be stressed out of how much work they have to do, but if they have a class that they enjoy doing, and doesn't have to do work then they wouldn't be stressed out they would be stress free . Another reason why I think student should have an extracurricular activity is because more student would show up to school. For example, last year I would always hate odd days so much that I didn't even want to show up to school but there was this one class that kept me from staying home. It was art class I would just enjoy laughing with my friends, finger painting, and drawing people. If I didn't had that class I wouldn't even have shown up to school. I also think if student have an extracurricular they would come back to class all pump up and ready to do work. For example if I had an extracurricular and it was yoga or exercise then I would be ready to go to my class to do some work. They say when you do exercise it pump up blood and flow to your brain which makes them all ready to learn. My final reason why I think student should have an extracurricular activity is because student will have a positive attitude. Have you ever had a student come into your classroom all grumpy and grouchy? Well it's most likely because of the period they had before you. I know this because I am a student and I've been in their shoes before. One day I came home with a bad attitude and my parents would ask me why I'm acting bad I would tell them how bad my day was. There are some days that I came home all happy and jump because how amazing and fun my day was. Which is why we should have an extracurricular activity because our parents or teachers shouldn't have to deal with our bad attitude.

I think student should get an extracurricular activity because it will help a lot to lower students stress, it would help get students ready to learn, it would help student have a great attitude, and it will help student show up to school more. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
07A88E52FC70,"What if you were doing a extracurricular activity and wanted to share the joy of it with everyone else? I do agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Having a extracurricular activity helps students become more social, more active, and provides people with information that is not taught in school.

A extra curricular activity can allow people to become more sociable and make more friends. This is possible because there are probably other people who want to join the same clubs as other peers. People in the same club can then become friends with people that have the same interests that they do. For example, say you join a sports team. You must be able to work well with them in order to win games, therefore you must socialize with your other teammates and become friends with them.

Students can also become more active in exercising, school, the environment, and the community. Ways to become more active in exercising is by joining a sports team, in a sports team you exercise all the time in order to preform properly in your chosen sport. Students can become more active in school by joining the student council. When you join the student council you help organize events that can be seen as enjoyment for the other students, or it can help raise money for other school activities. Next, students can have a better impact on the environment. To do this students can join the gardening club or a

GO GREEN

club, which helps the plants and animals near your school. Lastly, by joining an extracurricular club you can also help your community. For example by joining

NJHS

or girl/boy scouts. These two clubs have you do activities that help out in the community, like helping the elderly or bagging food for the homeless.

Lastly, joining a extracurricular activity can provide students with a more in depth look on subjects that they are interested in. Therefore, it is wise for students to join clubs for subjects that are not taught in depth in school. For example science, art, or writing. This can also help students figure out what they want to do with their future, and if different activities would interest them or not.

In my opinion, I do agree that every students should be required to do a extra curricular activity. Even though having a extracurricular activity can allow less time for homework, or can negatively effect you grades. A extracurricular activity can benefit students in many ways from them becoming more active in school and the community, making more friends that could last a life time, or the can provide students with a bigger outlook on activities that they want to pursue when they get older. Therefore, I still believe that having an extra curricular activity is beneficial to students, people just have to work a bit harder to maintain the grades that they need for school. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
7748A809ACFF,"Hi i'm Generic_Name and I hope you enjoy my essay. I disagree with this decision because I think its to hard on the students. I also think that this principal is to hard on the students.

One reason I disagree is to much stress. Because the kids already have more classes. And practicing out of school for this activity would be to hard considering they already have homework. And it would either shorten or make the day longer for the student's. And it might narrow down the students classes, if that happens then they probably wouldnt get everything done which would leave it for homework.

My second reason is to much practice and work out of school. So if you signed up for a sport then you would have to practice out of school to get better. Or if you signed up for art you would actually have to practice drawing. And if you do a extra activity and a instrument one of them would be practiced less. On top of all of that you have to study for classes out of school.

And my third and final reason is that the kids would be to tired. Because some kids have to do chores after school. And because they would have to practice and study. And if a kid is already doing a sport out of school they would have to go to that right after the extracurricular activity. And they would have to do homework.

In this essay I talked about how kids would be tired and how it would be to much stress. I also talked about how it would be to much practice out of school. I disagree with this decision because I think its to hard on the students.

63A908894771,"Participating in an activity isn't so bad and would help you. My reasons would make you participate and agree. I agree on participating in at least one extracurricular activity. First, it would help us be distracted in good things. Students wouldn't have time to be sad or depressed because they would be more focused on their activity. We would have less drama and less counselor visits. Kids wouldn't have time to think about drugs because their mind would be on sports, yearbook, or student council. In the end, it would help us be distracted in good things rather than bad things. Second, we would be learning other new things. For example, working on a yearbook helps you learn how to edit pictures and add effects to it. Sports make you learn how to be healthy and be in good shape. Student council would help you be more social. At last, you would be learning more other things from those activities. Lastly, less screen time. Our eyes would be healthy because some of these activities don't require phones or technology. We would be more motivated in watching a game than just playing our phones. Instead of talking to people online you would have them their in real life. All in all, we would have less screen time. In conclusion, participating in at least one extracurricular activity isn't so bad and would benefit you in many ways. Activities distract you in a good way. Your learning other things that school in general wouldn't teach you. Less screen time benefits your eyes. After your activities, you'll be a much better and healthier person.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
571B29B60BDC,"Is it a good idea to force students to participate in an extracurricular activity? I do not believe so. There are many reasons why not to force after school activities. It is not necessary to force students into taking an extracurricular activity because: the student could already be participating in a non-school related activity, the student's family might not be able to afford the activity, and the student might be unable to handle the extra work.

A lot of students actively participate in activities after they leave school,that are mostly run by the school they attend. However some activities are run by separate organizations. An example is the Y.M.C.A. They have swim teams for both adults and children to take part in and enjoy. If every student had to do some sort of school regulated extracurricular activity, then practices, or competitions could be scheduled at the same time. That would most likely cause those students to drop out of an activity they had enjoyed, to attend a school activity that is mandatory.

School activities are not always free. Sadly many families cannot afford more than what they use to survive. Unless the school pays for all the expenses, the student's family could have a hard time getting what is needed for that activity. If the student were to serve on the student council, money may be needed to start fundraisers, or give extra supplies for an event they set up. With most sports, the gear has to be bought in order for the student to play. To try out a current physical is needed, and that costs money that the family might not have to spare. Then if the student did not make the team the money was wasted. If the gas money to transport the student was unavailable, then they could not go.

Making kids participate in extracurricular activities could make them more active, but the student could have enough work to handle as it is. There are very many students around the globe who are very stressed about school. Adding activities that they have to prepare for and worry about could just add to their torment. A hardworking honor student that gets three packets of homework every night, will not have time to practice for volleyball, or prepare a speech for their school's student council. Perhaps there is a student who does their best but is not excelled at learning. to understand and pass his classes he might have to take extra time on homework. Maybe he has a tutor that he goes to after school to help him with difficult subjects. That student would not have much time to do anything but work if he had three hours of baseball practice when he got home.

In conclusion, schools should not force students to participate in an after school activity. It would cause more damage than good. Schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities because: many students are already in non-school based activities, the family of a student might not be able to afford the activity, and students are overwhelmed with work as it is.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
