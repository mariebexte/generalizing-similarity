6.91E+11,"Trophies, medals, awards and praise, our school could use a lot more of these and you could too! Why not make your contribution by joining an extracurricular activity? Coming home to too much free time and nothing to do is something we all suffer from, so is simply not being included. Our students should listen to our principal and solve this lonely epidemic of too much free time while doing what you're good at and what you love by joining a club, sport or any extracurricular activity! Students should all participate in an extracurricular because they have the opportunity to feel included in a team, be acknowledged for their talents, and improve their skills.

Feeling included isn't something anyone can just make happen, and the cliche ""just talk to people"" isn't very helpful in a school with thousands of other students. It is hard for one to put themselves out there. However, when in an extracurricular, students are surrounded by people who chose to be there because they have the same interests as them. When there are people who are just like you by your side, you can easily find a common interest to bond over rather than talking about nothing to someone who you know nothing about, a stranger. Students have peers within that group or club also need them for that extracurricular because no matter what they are apart of, an extracurricular makes a team! No one can be excluded in a team, because every member works together and relies on each other. Being apart of a club or sport means students are surrounded by their friends who all are doing what they love together, almost like a family.

Imagine, a student is out there and doing what they love most and what they are best at, once they're finished, students are rewarded with trophies, medals, and praise! it's almost everyone's fantasy, so make it reality! students should not daydream about what their life could be and what they want it be when it is a very real possibility to make happen! Our students deserve to be acknowledged for their amazing talents. There is always something for everyone. Join an extracurricular activity to get credit where credit is due.

No one can ever be perfect and there is always something one can improve of themselves. However, no one may never be able to improve and build their skills if a situation does not present itself for one to realize what their weakness is. It is hard to meet such an opportunity if we never take risks and ""play it safe"". An extracurricular will help us improve those weaknesses and even our strong ones to be the best that we can be by presenting us with a new challenge everyday. Those skills may be related to our athletic or mental capabilities, but no matter what activity students may be apart of, it is certain one can improve their teamwork and cooperation skills. students are also working with their peers who may have more experience and can help guide them through obstacles and can share their wisdom on how to improve their skills.

Taking risks and trying something new is always scary. However, there will always be an excuse not to do something and we will never know what we are missing out on if we never even try. we could surprise ourselves and others by going beyond our expectations and being able to tell the story of the time we tried something new. Students may just be alone and feeling excluded with the push needed to encourage them to get them outside and into the open. An extracurricular will always lead students to new opportunities like being apart of a team, building skills with those around them, and being praised and rewarded for what they are best at.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
53A88F5C2B68,"The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. My three reasons are to make friends, better chance to get into college, and develop character traits.

The first reason is that it is easier to make friends. Most people struggle with making friends. It would be easier if you knew you had something in common with them. when you are in one of these activities you're there with kids who enjoy what you enjoy. Not only is making friends a good reason to do extracurricular. Another one is you get better chances to get into college

Colleges look for people with not only good grades ,but extracurricular they look for people that will fit with the curriculum. When I was in seventh grade my language arts teacher told the class that people with more extracurricular get in college more often. Not only is a chance to get into college a reason to take extracurricular a great.

Another one is to develop character traits. If you are the captain or president of whatever you're doing you are developing leadership ,but you also know that it can be taken away. Sports teaches you teamwork,discipline, and a lot of other things. You can even learn new skills that you never knew you had.

Extracurricular are important to your life because they can teach you many things and make your future easier. Most people struggle at different things.  ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
2549F87DC5A0,"I personally think he is correct. Although i agree with his statement, not all children have to participate in an extracurricular activity, they should be allowed to choose which activities they do, if they wish to do any. I also think they should just enjoy their own hobbies, for example, music is a hobby of mine.

Alright, so let me explain this to you, some kids have special needs and arent able to do such activities. While others already have so much going on in their life and might get sidetracked from choosing an activity. While i understand some just dont want to do the activities, they should not be forced to. I understand that some people love these kinds of activities, however, some cannot do them. I mainly agree because

""exircise, is a mental health reliever"".

Some kids have certain physical problems,so they should at least be allowed to choose less physically active activities, for example, chess. Chess is a game more for the excirsise of the mind, than the body. Coding is another good one for kids who cant do physical activities. It improves their sense of direction,and quick thinking, at least, that is how i feel about it. Quite frankly,

I understand what this principal is trying to get across , however, he or she may be going about it all wrong.

I personally think the activites that he or she has requested people do, is reasonable. For example, the yearbook club, a nice, peacful club that doesnt require too much physical skill.

I think these kids should be required to do less of the activities, mainly because they have their own hobbies, why shouldnt they get to continue doing them as often as they normally would? I say this mainly because it just makes sense. You know? In a matter of, ""i like to do this over this"". and etc. I personally have a musical hobby. I play guitar, sing, and play a few other instruments that i know alot of young people play. Some people give up on hobbies because they are ""too hard"" or certain quotes like ""it's just not my thing"", i think everyone should always keep trying at their hobbies, even if they are already good at them, or are very bad at them.

I have stated my opinon, now listen reader, i will include bonus information about musical, and genral hobbies, if you don't mind.

There are alot of hobbies for you to try that are out in the world, some even count as legitimate jobs. I'll give you some examples. Being a guitarist is an exciting thing to do, mainly because other people love to hear it, and once you get the hang of it, it's just so easy to do. Another good hobby is being a singer. While you think it is probably easy to sing, it is actually quite difficult, especially if you are trying to hold a note. It's nowhere near as easy as it looks.

Alright so back to my opinion on the activities, i will now conclude for you, that everyone shouldn't have to do the activities, but overall i get the principals standpoint, so i agree with him/her. However, that does not mean you should go around quoting me, mainly because you should use the words for your own benifit, so with that said, that is my opinion, have a nice day!",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
B496C551E6D8,"I disagree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities because those activities require you to stay after school, and some students might have more important tasks to do at their homes. For example, those students might have to baby sit their little siblings while their mom is still at work. I will be going into a few more examples in the following paragraphs.

The first reason why students shouldn't participate in extracurricular activities is because some might have duties to help out their mother or father. Some of those duties could be making dinner, babysitting, mowing, etc. There will also be many parents who would not want their child doing these extracurricular activities. These duties take up time, and the extracurricular activities and mess with that time.

Secondly, some students might just think it's a waste of time. Doing the yearbook club doesn't really interest many students, saying that the yearbook club just goes around taking photos. Sports doesn't interest many people, due to that the training is difficult and it takes up a lot of time. Serving on the student council is stressful. even though you make minor choices, they don't get that much thought from the school administration. You have all these positions, but what yields from the experience? Not that much.

Lastly, some students might just want to have a chill day, and might not want anything to do with extracurricular activities. They don't want the stress from them. They want some time for themselves. These activities take time away from students, and many dislike that. being stressed can make school harder, make you sleep less, and make your over all performance dwindle.

These are my reasons fro why i disagree with this decision. Some might have curfews, important business, doctors appointments, and much more. Extracurricular activities take up quite an amount of time, and could get in the way. This is why that all students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
D712B132C8DF,"I agree that all students must be in one extracurricular activity and my activity is sports. I believe that football can make you work hard like running at someone or,running after the ball and you can play and have fun with friends. A lot of people like watching kid's play football at there school.

Football can make you work hard on running and throwing the ball. The reasons why running is so important is because you run a whole 50 yards and that is very far so they make you run everyday down the field and back three times at the most. They run everyday to help train your body to get in shape.

I think having fun is the most import part to being a football player because you get to hang out with friends on the field while playing football. I think making friends are fun because they can tech you some new stuff like new moves to get around on the field. The best part about making friends is that you get to hang out with them after the game.

I believe that football can make you work hard like running at someone or,running after the ball and you can play and have fun with friends.

0D944DDF9492,"It is very beneficial to participate in a extracurricular activity you could make new friends,not be bored all the time,find something new that you like,and find people that have the same hobbies as you. Participation is always key,but if you don't participate then you will be never find something that you like. If you dont participate then you will always be bored,and you will not make any new friends and who doesn't want to make new friends.

You can make new friends,and find people who have the same interest as you. Who doesn't want to make new friends, and making a new best friend who you can play soccer with because you both like soccer. If you never participated then you would've never known that he/she liked soccer. You could practice together and it will just be fun this is why you should participate in a extracurricular activity. You could meet new people and it will overall just be fun.

If you get involved then you won't be sitting at home bored. You could be doing something that you really enjoy,and you could be doing it with your friends. Your friends can make it ten times better so then you will most definitely not be bored. Most people would want to go out and do something,and not be sitting at home being bored. Your other friends might be out getting involved in something so that should motivate you to go out and get involved. Even your friends could motivate you to go and participate.

Getting involved and meeting new people you can also find people who have the same hobbies as you. Finding people with the same hobbies as you can be fun,and lets say you both like painting then yall could hang out and paint together. Who knows you might have other things in common with them. Then boom you just found you a new friend who has the same hobbies as you. If you never participated then you would've never met this person or would've know that they liked painting.

Since you have to participate if there is nothing that interest you then try something new,and if you don't like it then try something else,and if you still don't like it then well at least you tried. It's not that hard to try something new well if you don't like it then try something else it's that easy. At least you're still getting involved and trying your best thats all that matters. Who knows you might find something new that you like,and you would've never known. You don't have to be good at what you are doing it matters that you tried.

You need to get out there and participate you don't want to be bored all day and night. You will never know if you like to dance if you never try. You would never know that you and sally had the same hobbies. You would've never known,well you do want to know so go participate and make new friends. Remember participation is always key so go participate in your schools sports or something else that you enjoy the most. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
E84E56E90C78,"participating in extracurricular activities is like going on your dream vacation, it's fun and enjoyable. i agree with the principal, students should participate in extracurricular activities, for it helps students build social skills, allows students to build friendships, and teaches students how to solve problems.

To begin with, i believe that all students should participate in extracurricular activities such as student council because, when students are participating in extracurricular activities such as student council they are developing a number of skills such as, social skills. when students are communicating with one another and expressing their opinions or beliefs they are becoming more social. For example, when student are communicating and working together with their peers.

In addition to, when students are participating in extracurricular activities such as student council, students learn how to solve problems. for instance, when students are communicating with each other to solve a problem they are developing problem solving skills.

Also, extracurricular activities allows students to develop friendships. when students are talking and communicating with other students, and working together with other students they may develop friendships. for example, when students are working together in student council they are always communicating and sharing ideas, and doing this will bring them closer together and create friendships.

however, some people believe that students should not participate in extracurricular activities because, students won't have time to study for test, less time to spend with family, and students will be tired after they get home. but i do believe that students should participate in extracurricular activities.

in conclusion, i believe that students should participate in extracurricular activities, for participating in extracurricular activities has many benefits such as, helping students develop social skills, helps students build problem solving skills, and allows students to build friendships. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
79F1EBED5921,"Most schools don't make their students participate in after school activities, but mine dose.

I don't agree with the choice and hears why.

Students have to sit at school and behave for eight hours a day. So when its time to finally time to go home and spend time with family and relax were excited. When you make us do extracurricular actives we don't get that time at home to relax and spend time with are family. I think we sometimes forget that everyone needs there own personal time to them self.

Although thats a big part of why I disagree with my principal I still have more to say. Some students may not have a ride to these extracurricular actives or a ride to get back home. Which could bring stress to the students parents. I may not be a parent myself but I know being a parent can be very stressful. Many parents work late night shifts. In which they can't be there to pick up their son or daughter.

My third and most important reason is that kids should be kids. We deserve to go outside and play and play video games. We deserve a childhood not being a miniature adult with lots extra tasks to do and think about. We need this time now to grow and be kid because in the real world they're a much bigger consequent then being grounded. Theses extracurricular activities are taking up all our time and a lot of us don't even like the activity we have.

All in all, we should'nt be forced to do something we don't want to. It should be optional to join a extracurricular activity. I just wish my principal would have looked at his chose from different points of view.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
9C8F1731D481,"""Rumble rumble rumble"" the after school bus roars to life as it carries uninterested students back home from a long day at school. I would love to just relax at my house, catching up on homework, or taking a small nap. Nobody should be forced upon to do an extracurricular activity.

After a day of school, some kids would be too busy to stay after.

I would fall under that category. By that I mean I already have after school events. For example, I play two sports which are soccer and basketball. I also have religious education once every week. I know that I am not the only one who feels this way. Some children could be interested in partaking in a different hobby. They might want to try something new. One of my friends is interested in playing lacrosse. She would be too tired to go out to skills evaluation because she was working at school all day. Young men and women may not even have the time for it. They already have commitments such as: practices, religion practice, homework, and other responsibilities that they need to accomplish at home. When I stay after school, I only have a little bit of time to eat dinner before I get dragged to my next activity.

However, it's not just whether or not pupils have the time and energy for extracurricular events, interest is another factor of the problem. The purpose of after school is to have students pick what they want to do and to have fun doing it. It is entirely upon the child's decision if they want to go home at regular school hours. I definitely do not like to stay at school any longer if I don't have to. I prefer to go home, and to be productive there. Some kids just aren't persuaded to participate in any of the options that after school has to offer. I am only intrigued by only a mere amount of events that goes on. Some of which don't last all year, or starts later in the year. For example, the girls' basketball team does not start until halfway through first semester. I, along with other pupils want to simply relax from a productive day's work. We may have had a bad day earlier, and we just want to go home and decompress. On my free days in which I don't have any activities post school, I love to take advantage of that and to lie down onto my bed and listen to music. Or, I can head over to a friends house and we can enjoy what little hours we have until we need to get rest for the next day.

It's not just how the young scholars feel, it is upon the parents' schedule as well. Some guardians may have work later than usual, and they might not get back until late at night. Or some, have to leave for work around the time that their child is coming home, they can't be late for their job and their kid does not posses the house key. As the guardian(s) would be at work, who could pick up the student? Late buses do not run everyday. But even if it did, the child could easily miss the bus for numerous reasons: not being able to hear their bus number called, being sent out late, or simply forgetting what bus number they are. There is also the possibility that the event let them out much earlier than the time to board the buses, someone would have the obligation to come and pick up the young man or woman. Not all post events are free, some come with fees. Perhaps an activity has a costly amount of money behind it. Not everyone could afford it, thus the pupil could not take part in the action. If the parents could not support the funding of this event, then the scholar would have to choose another post school meeting to do. Which may lead to the parent feeling remorse.

Having to participate in something that is being forced upon is not a good feeling. Kids should partake in an event because they feel good doing it, not because they had to do it. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
168E5BD0AECE,"The Principle has decided to mandate every student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, but is it a good idea? I think that the pros can eventually outweigh the cons if these tools are used properly. The social impact, impact on interests, and future impact can be very useful in their futures.

First of all, how much of an impact these activities is pretty cool when you think about it. One reason is because many students will be able to make friends in these activities, because everyone there shares at least one interest. It opens them up to people with similar interests which could be very helpful in making friends. Another reason is because these activities will give them time to hangout with their previously-made friends, or their new friends they just met. Last reason I will mention is stress levels. Their stress could get significantly lower, because they are hanging out with friends which usually makes people happier and with that they become more approachable. That is why the social impact it can have is positive.

Second of all, the impact it can have on interests is a positive one. The activities can help these student find new interests, and that gives them something to look forward to, fight for, and relax with. With these new found interests or pre-existing ones, they can develop those interests and keep building on them. Last reason is that these interests and hobbies developed in their adolescence years can open up and create future job opportunities but I will get to that in a bit. Those are a few positive ways this idea would impact interests.

Last reason it the impact on their futures. They might be able to make good, loyal lifelong friends, and if not lifelong at least long term, because they will be surrounded with people of similar interests and will most likely become more approachable. Like I mentioned before, this idea will be able to create job opportunities. For example, if one kid really likes computers but never thought about learning programming, with this new idea, they will be able to decide on programming and develop that interest. They might go to college for it and get a job in programming for a major tech giant. Another kid might already play soccer but with this extracurricular activity idea, it will open them up to a more talented pool of player where they can develop their craft and go pro. Last but not least, it can improve their time management skill. Some kids will be forced to manage their time more efficiently now that they have more on their plate. At first that might not sound like a good idea, but these extracurricular activities wont take priority, and this isnt as important as losing income because you got fired, or not being able to do something because you forgot. They will be able to decide on how to best manage their time and what works for them.

The Principle brought up a good talking point with this idea, that can be looked at in many different view points. My opinion on this is that it should be implemented for all of the reasons above. The positive impacts that this idea can have on their social life, interests, and future are undeniable and are what make this a good enough idea.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
1A9B74784B92,"Have you ever been forced to do something that you dont want to do? A principle has decided to make students be, at least one, extracurricular activity. as it may sound nice, it's not as nice as you think it is? Some students aren't able to pay for those activities, most students are already a part of an activity, and other physically blocked to play sports. Now you should already have a different opinion then you have now.

First, you should know that some parents or guardians aren't able to pay for extracurricular activities. Most parents don't have enough money to pay for activities. Some can't buy the items you would need to play the sport. Others can't pay the fees to go to the games or to start the sport. Parents may not want to their kids to play sports so they can save up for other needs like college and other needs.

Second, students may already have a sport that they do outside or school. Some students don't like the sport options that their school has, so they do other outside of school. For instance, if you wanted to learn how to ride a horse you would usually have to go to another place to learn how to do ride a horse. Students should be able to do the sport they want to do for a living and school can get in the way if they needed to do an extra sport. They need to practice their sport if they want to do it for a living.

Last, some students aren't able to physically do any sport. Most students who can't do sports have a sickness that can't go away. Sicknesses can keep a kid away from doing sports. Asthma is a bad one that can be bad enough to where you can't run at all. Cancer can make someone not able to do sports or really anything physical. These kids who have sicknesses have a tough time already and it will be even harder if schools make you do extracurricular activities.

Now you should have a different opinion about this topic. Students should not have to do an extracurricular activity. They should be able to do any sport they want. Students don't need any more stress about school.        ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
97622A00565F,"A frantic middle schooler had just received a load of homework from all of her teachers. Packets upon worksheets upon study guides that all needed to be done tonight. If she had to stay after school there would be no time for chores that needed to be done and the homework. Children and parents have the right to choose if they would want to do after school. Not all parents and students would agree with having after school mandatory. Is having a madatory after school really benificial.

Students should be able to choose if they want to do after school. Some students have a lot of homework already that the teachers give out, so most students are spending a sunny day inside doing homework after a long day at school and a long after school activity. Many students have stress and are overwhelmed by having too much homework and after school right after that. Most students have enough work that had to be done during school. Why push it so they have to stay longer and do more work than they should. Adding after school to the schedule will make more busy parents frustrated because they are the ones who have to pick up their child. The after school schedules does not meet up with the parents schedule and it make everything chaotic and difficult. Students and Parents have a routine that they do everyday but, if you add a mandatory after school it messes up the routine.

Maybe its not just the students and the parents who are frustrated because most of teachers will be too. Teachers had a long day of having to put up with back talk and misbehaving kids at school. They just want to go home and relax with their family. Teachers also have duties at home just like kids, but they have to grade students work and enter it into a online system. If teachers have to put after school into their schedule many teachers would be really tired and exhausted from working before school until after school. Teacher have a life outside of school just like the kids that attend school do so, it really should be their choice if they want to do after school or not. Not just teachers but faculty and staff will have to do double the work and double the cleaning from after school. Students are not the only one that need a break.

After school can affect the community in different ways. One way is by have a lot of cars and buses on the road while other people are trying to go home from work. The road will be filled with cars and buses clogging up the streets. Another way is that children and teens might have sports they have to be at. If you add after school they would not make it in time. Siblings have to go places too and they need their parents to drive them places but the parent is stuck picking up their child from after school. Schools should be worried if they have all of the children doing different thing, some outside, some in classrooms, some behind the school. It can be hard to keep track of them all.

Basically, the child should have a choice weather or not they want do after school or not. Parent would want after school to fit into their routine, their schedule not the schools. Not just that it fits into schedule but some parents and children do not like what the school has to offer. After school is a choice because students, teachers, parents, and the community need the choice if they want after school or not. One way to help everyone is by giving everyone a choice and condensing after school into a small thing. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
F4EC42B28077,"Do you want to be forced to play a sport, work in the yearbook, or be in the student council? Our principal has decided that you have to do at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular means out of school so that automatically puts many roles in play. Since you cannot say no to the principal, it means you have no choice but to participate in one. Students should not have to do an extracurricular activity because their family might not have enough money to support one, there can be transportation issues, and students would have less time to complete their daily expectations.

One reason why students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is that their family might not have enough money to financially support one. That means that you are adding to the fact that there are already money struggles. Most extracurricular activities come with some sort of cost which means adding an extracurricular activity to the bill would likely cause stress. Unless the school is willing to pay for each persons activity, the principal should not be allowed to force it upon them to complete a sport or whatever they choose. If the principal is planning on requiring at least one activity to be done per student throughout the whole school year and not just one quarter or semester, that would add even more cost that the parents have to take out of their paycheck.

Another reason why students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is because their family might not be able to take them everyday. Their guardians have to take time out of their own day to drive their kid to a place that might be a far distance from their home. It also might cause their parents to have to leave work early or hire someone to drive them, both affecting their paycheck. The students could carpool but there's a big chance that you won't know anyone doing the same activity as you. No matter what, whoever is driving you will still have to pay for gas. Since the principal is requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity they should offer transportation, but since they are not it really leaves you no choice but to figure it out on your own.

A third reason why students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is that they will have a lot less time for their daily expectations. Students often receive homework everyday and have chores they need to complete. They also have to spend time with their family, eat dinner, and they might have plans with their friends. The activity they have to do will most likely conflict with at least one of those things. It would be a shame that their family would have to change their schedule in order for it to work out with the students' activity. The activity would most likely last longer than an hour which pulls a big chunk of time away from them being able to do their homework, chores, and eat. It could risk students falling behind in school and cause extreme stress. The students may also drift from their friends and family and their health can decline from lack of sleep and nutrition.

These are just three reasons explaining how forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity can be harmful financially, health wise, and many other ways. Being forced to do a sport or something of the sort can cause a lot of unessecary stress at such a young age. It should be a students choice if he or she wants to do an extracurricular activity, but it should not be forced.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
CF73E9CEBB0F,"Making students do a extracurricular activity would be a great thing for students. It can also lead to many positive things and could make a big change to students. It allows students to meet new people they may never would interact with. And it enables students to be able to learn new things they may haven't learned yet. Also it lets students be able to learn great skills that they may need in life. Another thing is that students can find a new hobby they may never thought they would like. So I agree that making students do a extracurricular activity it can lead to great things by letting students find new hobbies or things they like to do, learning important skills, and meeting new people.

Many people have many hobbies or things they like to do. And by making students do a extracurricular activity it can help students find new things they like to do. Sports are a fun and enjoyable activity many students do and love. And by making students do a extracurricular activity, it can help students find a sport they really enjoy that they didn't think they would like. Another activity students may like to do would be art. Many people are fascinated by art and many students may not think they like it, but if students have to do a extracurricular activity it may lead to some finding a love for art. Also music is a thing a lot of people like to listen to or sing. And if some students do band or choir maybe they will find a liking to it. They are al lot so many activities students can do and find out they enjoy it. And by making students do a extracurricular activity they can find a liking to something they didn't think they would enjoy and create a new hobby for it.

Learning important skills can help students during life. And by doing extracurricular activities students can learn some along the way. Learning skills like being able to work together can be very beneficial. And by learning how to work together students can maybe help job teams or even their sports team to be like the Super Bowl winning Kansas City Chiefs or the Milwaukee Bucks. Another important skill is being able to be patient. By being patient it could help students not rush into things to fast and make things worse. And one last important skill students can learn is to never give up. If students never give up it can help them get closer to their goal or even achieve it. There is many important skills students can learn from doing a extracurricular activity, but these can really help a student a lot when the time is needed in life.

Meeting new people is great thing for students to do. And by students doing a extracurricular activity students would be able to meet many new people. By meeting new people you can learn a lot about someone you may have not known. Another thing is that students can be able meet different students from different classes they may not have. Also if a student does a sport, band, or choir they can meet different people from other schools. And in addition to meeting new people, students can find things they didn't know they had in common with other people and it could lead to them becoming great friends. Meeting new people is a great thing, and by doing extracurricular activities students can meet a lot of new people.

Making students do a extracurricular activity has many benefits in for students. By making them do a extracurricular activity it allows the students to learn new things. It also allows students to learn very important skills they need to know. Another thing is that it allows students to find new hobbies. And it also allows students to meet other students they may never talk to or would ever meet if they didn't do a extracurricular activity. In conclusion, making students do a extracurricular activity can lead to many positive things. It allows them to find new hobbies,learn important skills, and meet new people.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

I lift my leg and shoot and my ball hits the net within second. The crowd cheering my teammates gathered around me. We just won the first championship game for Generic_School. This is commonly known as extracurricular activities that are offered and put together by the schools. We should be able to participate in yearbook staff, team sports or any extracurricular activities.

One of the reasons we should have these activities for students is because they can improve social skills. For example if you were running down the court and your teammate on the other side you can communicate to them ""Pass I'm open!"". According to activitesforstudents. org having children and students be on a team can improve many things teamwork abilities,social skills, along with confidence. But some people argue that having these teams and a type of competitiveness which can cause kids to be rude and be unkind to the other teammates who they think is ""not good enough"". A true story from americanantibullysociety. org. about a young boy who was home schooled and very shy. He later came to public school where he sat alone at lunch and didnt talk to anyone. A few months later he joined the yearbook staff. He became very social and everyone wanted to be his friend. He later realized that having these connections at school is a necessity. This really puts in perspective why we should have extracurricular activities.

Another reason that we should have this rule is because it can help you become more involved with the school system. An article titled ""Children need extracurricular activities!"" claims that doing these activities can decrease the number of children and teens led into mental problems or social skills. A website called USAschools. com stated that in just the last year the number of kids who arent in activities at school end up being indoors and isolating themselves which could lead to no friends and could lead to larger more severe problems. Having these activities will attract more students to join new schools if they have good sport teams or any of there other interests.

Some people argue that school should only be for academics. There wrong because although schools are for learning new concepts in math,science, civics and more doesnt mean students should not have the opportunity to join a yearbook staff or a sports team. on the other hand, maybe we shouldnt have these activities because the schools already put enough money into teaching kids do we need to spend more money on this activities?

I think that we should have this rule because these activities help in so many ways not just inside of school but outside to! We should be able to participate in yearbook staff, team sports or any extracurricular activities.

0DB1CE0764E9,"Have you ever felt the excitement of being with your friends after school and doing something that you all love? Extracurricular activities include chess, soccer, basketball, and choir. There are an endless amount of after school activities, so everyone can have something to do. I agree with the fact that everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity because they help one to make new friends, they are lots of fun, and they help make great learning experiences.

When one comes to a new school, not knowing anyone can be a struggle. Extracurricular activities can help create a friend group for you. Extracurricular activities only happen around once a week, so you can spend that time with your friends. Many people only have a little friend group that they like to hang around, and extracurricular activities help expose people to new friends. Boosting your friend group can also lead to a boost in your self confidence around others. This is a reason that more people should be involved in extracurricular activities.

Extracurricular activities are a lot of fun. You get to hang out with your friends while doing what you love. There are such a variety of activities that you can do whatever you want without worrying that there isn't something for you. Besides, if your friends are doing an activity with you, it will probably be fun anyways. Extracurricular activities can help you find the fun things there are in high school and college.

Extracurricular activities are a great learning experience. They are amazing because they can make your day seem more fulfilling than it already was. Extracurricular activities can help you create more skills than you already have because they help you to develop more and more skills that will benefit you later in life. More and more colleges are looking for people to play sports for them. Extracurricular activities can help to get you into college for a lower cost. This is my final reason why extracurricular activities are a great idea.

Everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity because they help you make friends, they are a lot of fun, and they create great learning experiences. Everyone will have something for them to do after school because there are so many options. Extracurricular activities help you get your mind stay relaxed. From soccer to being in the musical there are so many options for extracurricular activities.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
BAC9D8631137,"Have you ever wanted to learn to take photos? maybe get a taste of managing a community? How about building a hovercraft with wood and shower curtains? Well then you should sign up for a club! extracurricular activities or clubs are programs sponsored by a set of teachers that allow students to experiment and try new things and experiences that you can't normally take a class for. I believe that participating in an extracurricular activity should be mandatory for all students.

First of all, you can get insight on what you might want your career to be. For example, taking a class on CPR, basic first aid, or how to respond to an emergency might make you realize that you want to be a nurse or doctor. In the club I've taken, its a computer support club. It's shown me that in the future I want a position that involves a team, a place where I can take charge, and can fix technology problems. This shows that clubs might help narrow down job choices, with more specific subjects that broad classes can't really hit home with.

Furthermore, it could help you learn about a class that you just couldn't take because of a full schedule. An example of this is me actually. I'm interested in learning photography, but next year i'm taking Spanish and band and as such, I have to pass up on photography. However, if the school had a photography club next year, I could sign up and get a foundation on developing my hobby of photography so I could learn on my own time! this shows that clubs are the perfect opportunity to have fun with the classes that you missed out on for more important things like languages or band. This shows that clubs are perfect to help students who's schedule is just too packed for the average student

Building off of that, Clubs could teach important life skills. A few good examples are serving on the student council could teach you how to be an active member in your community, which is an amazing skill to have. Cooking club teaches you how to cook, which is literally a vital skill needed to live. Technology clubs can help you fix your own problems in a world where technology is becoming more and more important and more jobs are opening up to fix said technology. This shows that clubs not only are for fun, but they can help you live a better life overall.

Ultimately, clubs can help you pinpoint your career in life, get a taste of that one class you never got to take, and even provide you with skills needed to live in the real world. if you want to get more involved in your clubs, then you can always sign up for one, or think about sponsoring a club of your own to kick start the process and provide other with the tools for success. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
1E5FF0F98ECA,"Extracurricular activities are beneficial for kids who are bored, want to invest time into earning a scholarship, or want to change something by putting themselves out there. However, does this mean every kid has to?

I don't believe that us kids should be forced to partake in after school activities.

First, not all schools provide a wide variety in extracurricular activities, which means that we are limiting the creativity, or expression, in students. So, by telling a student, ""You have to participate in at least one activity,"" you are saying, ""You have to be into these type of categories, or you'll never succeed."" Children need to understand that you don't need to be a school sports athlete in order to do what you want in life..

Secondly, not all kids have the opportunity to stay after school. Some kids may have to take care of elders, or have a ton of homework. School is important, yes, but kids need to put their important, after school lives, first. Often, most kids' parents get home too late to pick up their child, leaving the kid to walk home, hitchhike, or phone a friend, which may be inconvenient for the friend, and dangerous.

Lastly, the kid may lose personal interest in other things. What if he/she decided to join an after school club just to feel left out, or stressed, and grew a bad attitude towards the club? This can cause stress, anxiety, and loss of sleep if he/she is stressed due to their dislike towards the club, but they are being forced, so they can not do anything about it. These causes can effect bad behavior in school, sleeping in class, dropping grades, and lack of interest in learning.

In conclusion, it should not be required to participate in sports, or activities. Children deserve to make their own decisions in order to have the same experience as an adult. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
69E159567D65,"Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock . You watch the clock's hand slowly move towards freedom, the end of the school day. Without extracurriculars to interrupt core classes like math, english, science, and history, the school day is long and tedious. Curriculum planned by the state can be confusing and boring, making kids stressed and unfocused mere hours into the day. It's hard to find time for hobbies with the mountains of homework given in classes that aren't chosen by kids. Designed to be fun and engaging, activities outside of the four main classes include things like band, orchestra, yearbook, sports, and more, depending on what different schools offer. Students should have to participate in extracurriculars during the school day because they can alleviate stress, make students socialize, and help kids find new interests.

After test upon test upon test, extracurriculars give students a little bit of solace and time to relax. Classes, especially math and science, make students labor hard over textbooks and homework. Activities that students choose to take, like yearbook or student council, typically have little to no homework. These classes are more free form, a place that isn't so strict compared to core subjects. Because they're chosen subjects, not forced, they are also more fun for the children taking them. Students are always worrying about grades, which usually aren't a problem in extracurriculars because they are easy to earn as long as work is completed on time in class.

Not every student is a social butterfly, but electives help them to reach out of their comfort zones. Required classes are usually silent, making it hard to make new friends. Electives help kids meet people who share the same interests as them. Even if a person is introverted, it's good to find someone who shares something in common with them. For students that already have friends in their classes, they can talk more and may even be allowed to sit next to each other, a privilege rare in core subjects.

If a student has a job to help support their family outside of the school day, then between homework and their work they don't have time to find new interests. Special classes during the school day create the time and space for students to explore new hobbies. These interests can lead kids to think about their futures and potential career options. For example, a student who works on the school newspaper can find great enjoyment in writing and can think about majoring in journalism. Activities like student council and speech and debate give kids a look into political jobs, which later in life they may want to pursue.

Students shouldn't be forced to do anything, but they still have free choice with extracurriculars because there are many different classes that they can elect to take. The next time you're asked if you support extracurriculars during the school day, say yes. These activities can be a great break from the school day, help people make new friends, and help kids find new interests.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
EDBC0E9475DD,"Why Students Should do a Extra Curricular Activity

Have you ever been stressed and need something to clear your mind? That is why students should be required to do at least one extra curricular activity. Extra curricular activities is a great opportunity that every kid should be required to do because it lets you take your mind of of school and do something that you enjoy with your friends.

Extra curricular activities are a great way to meet new people and practice life skills. I moved to a school this year and I new very few people, but then I joined a extra curricular activity and I met a lot of people. This also means that people from a grade can still hang out with someone from a different grade level. Meeting people gives you great life skills because you learn how to greet people and you learn how to be more social and less shy. This means that people meet a lot of new people and they learn a lot about each other. You also learn their points of view. You learn a lot of different perspectives on how to fix certain problems that our would is facing. With all of those points of views, you can learn the best ways to fix the problems. Some people may say that you can do that outside of an extra curricular activity, but that is wrong because if you go to the grocery store you would not stop every one that is going down the isle and talk to them for 30 minutes. If you were a part of an extra curricular activity, you would have the chance to talk longer because you are with them after school for a long time.

Extra curricular activities are also a great way to do something that you enjoy. I joined a extra curricular activity and I am always exited to go there after school and have fun. I love doing it and I would not be able to do it at home. This means that I have a lot of fun doing what I love with new friends that I can hang out with. It also lets you not stress over school and think about something happy and exiting. Some people may say that anything you do at the school you can do at home, but that is not true because some people that go to the public schools can not afford it and even If you did, you would still need to bring people to your house to play it. If you did bring people over to do that it would be the same thing as having it at you school, but worse because it is less convenient and the school pays for the equipment. If you did it at your house you would have to pay. Some parents can not even pick their kids up until a little later so it gives them something fun to do. That is why it is a great way to do something that you enjoy.

Extra curricular activities should also be enforced because it lets people try new things that they may not be able to do at home. It is always good to try new things because you do not know if you like it. You may be really good at it, but you never know until you try. If you hate that extra curricular activity than their are a lot more and I am sure that you will find some that you really love and enjoy. This means that you find something you love and can connect to other people that love that activity as well. Some people may say that you can connect with people that do not do an extra curricular activity, but that is not true because it would be very hard to ask a lot of people what they love to do outside of school. If you do an extra curricular activity, it would be a lot easier to connect and you may end up being great friends at school and maybe even in the future. It is a lot easier to make connections and get to know each other if you spend a lot of time together.

Students should defiantly be forced to participate in extra curricular activities. Extra curricular activities lets kids try new things that they may love. Extra curricular activities also lets you meet new people. Students should defiantly be forced to participate in extra curricular activities. Extra curricular activities lets you take your mind of off school and it lets you hang out with friends. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
644BB909C87B,"In schools today, the average amount of students participating in extracurricular activities is only about half of the school's population. This number continues to go down as more students lose interest in participation because of the technological advances. Additionally, they do not make an attempt to participate in the provided activities with the assumption that there is no need for them to go. Although students may believe that it is pointless, there are many benefits to participating in them. By requiring all students to take at least one activity, it gives them the push they need to start their exploration with the variety of options given. This requirement for students is necessary for schools because it would increase their school spirit, give them place to socialize, and help them with time management.

If all students were to participate in an extracurricular activity for school, the increase of involvement would bring more school spirit. For example, students look forward to big football games because it generates energy and excitement from everyone. They come to watch the games in big crowds, always representing their school with coordinating colors and often wearing face paint. It creates a lot of school spirit not only from the stands, but also the players that are participating in the games. Players absorb the support given off by the spirit of the crowd and use it to boost up their own energy, which increases their playing performance. Another example of an activity that increases school spirit is academic teams. For example, Science Olympiad is an after school club that often competes with other teams across the county. The members always have a lot of spirit, representing their school through their outfits. When they win these competitions, students and staff members are energetic about the accomplishment that the team has made for the school. These sports and academic teams are both examples of extracurricular activities that generate more energy for schools and are just a proportion of activities that students can participate in. Along with the school spirit that these activities bring, they would also create a place for students to talk to each other.

The large variety of different students doing extracurricular activities would give them opportunities to socialize and meet new people. During school there is not much time for students to talk because of classes and lessons that are being taught. With extracurricular activities, they are able to join together with friends and socialize with each other for a longer amount of time. Students can join clubs such as the newspaper and yearbook committee, or sports teams like football and basketball. For example, last year I joined the yearbook club because one of my friends went with me. We were able to talk to each other for longer than we used to, and even grew closer because of it. Additionally, extracurricular activities allow students to meet new people. For example, I joined an after school club as a consultant to guide students with their writing. Through that club I have met a range of different people that I have connected with, whether it be the other consultants or the students I have helped. It has allowed me to make new friends with people I had never met before. All extracurricular activities not only give students chances to socialize with old or new friends, but also allows students to manage their time.

Requiring students to partake in extracurricular activities helps them practice their time management of school work and extra activities. Along with the activities that students would have to do, they would continue to get loads of school work. This is good for students because it makes them think about how they manage their time. For example, I play on a volleyball team as one of my extracurricular activities. With the two hour practices during the weekdays and eight hour tournaments on the weekends, it was hard to manage everything at first. I started to organize my schedules and prioritize the most important things first, such as assessments for school. The experiences that I have had with handling volleyball and school has helped me learn to manage the once overwhelming workload. This time management that students like me will learn is important because it prepares them for life after graduating high school. For example, colleges have higher amounts of school work from the classes for credits and majors for different occupations. To be able to handle the workload and out of school activities, students need to be able to manage their time efficiently. Additionally, many jobs such as doctors and lawyers also have big amounts of work to do. Through being organized with their schedules and managing their time, they can work efficiently without stress. College students and workers that already know how to manage their time because of high school will do a better job than those who did not. That is why by making students take extracurricular activities now, it prepares their time management for college and future occupations.

The school should require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it creates energy from them, allows them to talk with old or new friends, and prepares their time management skills. Activities such as team sports generate school spirit from the supporters and players because of the large amount of energy that is given off. In addition, all extracurricular activities create a space for students to socialize with people and even make new friends. With these activities there is also the school workload, which teaches students to manage their more time efficiently. These prove that by requiring students to participate in an activity it benefits the students more so than the school. Therefore, our school, and even all schools across the country, should make this a requirement for their students.                ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
05DF38C35D1D,"Many students engage in school activities. The athletes play sports after school, the drama kids join plays, and book clubs meet up after school to discuss their book. I think that students should participate in an extracurricular activity. Students participating in an extracurricular activity is a phenomenal idea because it is a good way for the student to take a break from school work, the student is doing something they enjoy, and their activity could help the student later on in life.

Firstly, an extracurricular activity is a good way for the student to take a break from school work. School work can be very stressful and time consuming to a student. The student is receiving school work every day throughout the year, and most of the time their teacher gives them homework right after they are done with their school work. The student could use their extracurricular activity as a way to take a break from their school work. I, being a student myself, do not enjoy school work, so I joined a book club and go to meetings every Saturday.

Secondly, the student can do something that they enjoy for an extracurricular activity. A lot of students in this generation get very bored easily, especially if what they are doing is something that they do not enjoy. Many students that I know think that school work is very boring and they hate doing their homework. If the student joins or engages in an extracurricular activity at school, they can do something that they enjoy doing. While they are doing the activity, they can meet other people that enjoys it too. For example, I enjoy singing and acting and I have been doing those things since I was four years old. Now that I am older and I enjoy it even more, I joined an advanced singing group, I take a drama class, and I got into the school play.

Lastly, the students extracurricular activity could help them with many things later on in their life. Many athletes play sports because they like sports, but some sports can get the athlete a scholarship to college, if the student wants to attend college, and can probably give them many opportunities while they are in college. Their activity can be on their record and look very good to colleges and the student would have a better chance of getting into the college that they want to go to.

The students activity could also help with certain skills that they would need for the students occupation. For example, when I grow up I want to be a singer. Being in an advanced singing group helps me learn how to do certain techniques that a singer would have to know.

In conclusion, taking a break from school, the student doing something they enjoy, and a good help for the students future are reasons why I think students should participate in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are phenomenal for students and very helpful for students as well. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
1306DBD7573C,"Do you think students should have to participate in an extracurricular activity? In my opinion, they should. I was in an after school activity, and it benefited me. Students should have to participate in, at least, one extracurricular activity because students learn how to work together as a group, it can help them connect what they are learning to the real world, it can teach them valuable lessons, and it can help students make friends.

Learning teamwork is very important. When you go to apply for a job, teamwork is a good skill to have. Also, in school, when students work with other students, they are showing teamwork. For example, on the school sports teams, they have to work together to win the game. Teamwork is a spectacular skill to have.

Another reason students should participate in after school activities is because it can help them connect what they're learning into the real world. For example, a student who works with the yearbook club helps them connect their writing skill to things other than just writing a short essay. A further example is if a student participates in the STEAM club, they are using science, technology, engineering, art, and math into something they can connect the materials to. Knowing how the skill students are learning connects to what they might do out of school might help them want to learn it.

A further reason is that it can teach students valuable lessons. Some students may be used to always being focused on one thing. If one of these students joins the school play, however, they would learn to focus on every detail. For another example, a student might be used to working on one topic, so joining an extracurricular activity may help with that. Also, being in an after school activity could help with developing social skills as well.

My final reason is that being in a after school group helps students make friends. Making friends is hard during a school day, especially when you're always moving classes. Even during a class, students are so focused on their work, they will not get the chance to talk to the people around them. When students join an extracurricular activity, making friends is easier. In these groups, you stay longer, most of the time, than in a class.

Being in an extracurricular activity benefits students by teaching them teamwork, connecting materials of learning to the real world, helping them learn a lesson that is important, and giving them a chance to make friends.

The first idea I had in mind with is making new friends. If you agree and you like making new friends, then would be really qualified for these kind of activities that your principal has listed.

Now, im going to break it down for you guys. My second idea is when you are bored at home everyday after school, and you go complain to your parents that your bored because you have nothing to do, then sighning up with one of those activities shouldnt be so hard for you. So now you wouldnt have to go home bored everyday.

Also,you start communicating with more people. And once you meet someone nice, you guys might have a few things in common with each other. Thats why it is so important to start trying new things , because you'll never know the good things that'll happen.

Ohh yeah, one more good thing, is you can also create new things or think of somemore cool ideas for your principal to add to that activities list for your school games or something that'll make people smile.

Example 2, a wrestling class, a class or sport is when two people wrestle it out and whoever taps out loses, can make you stronger faster and better at making up strategies that can influence on what you wanna do when your grown up, therefore will help you grow and move on in life.

Example 3, a recycle class, a class where you pick up trash in parks,sidewalks,your school can help you by making you feel good to do very generous things,plus your helping out the planet making you wanna do more good deeds,and lead down a good road,therefore will help you grow and move on in life.

9F03562EA45B,"On a rainy Tuesday morning, you walk to the bus stop with the clothes you wore yesterday, messed up hair, and such baggy, dark eyes you could go get groceries with them. Once you get to the bus stop you lay down on the wet concrete floor and shut your eyes. Someone accidentally kicks you in the arm. After that you open your eyes slower than a sloth, and notice there is three more people at the bus stop. You also notice that they're all wearing the same clothing from yesterday as well. In addition to that they also have baggy eyes and messy hair. You start wondering why we are all like that. The bus gets there and the bus driver honks at all of you for laying on the floor. Generic_Name ,your best friend leads the way onto the bus. ""Ya'll look like dirty slugs. are ya'll okay?,"" your bus driver, Ms Generic_Name asks in a high pitched voice. No one responds back. The whole bus ride is dead silent which gives you a chance to get some rest. ""Hey, Generic_Name have you finished the science homework,"" you ask with a sleepy toned voice. She responds, ""Yea, i spent all night doing it."" Those were the only words spoken during the entire bus ride. Once you got to school the principal greeted you and your fellow classmates with a wide grin. Walking down the hall was difficult because of the lack of energy in everybody. ""Hello class i hope everybody got more sleep than i did,"" your teacher, Mr. Generic_Name, mumbles. ""Today we will learn about the four comma rules. This is very important so pay attention."" Even with your teacher's warning you still zone out and wonder why your principal would make you all take an extracurricular activity when you already have so much to do. You start closing your eyes slowly trying to fight back the sleepiness, but you dont put much of a fight and you fall asleep. I disagree with the principal's decision because if we all had to participate in a extracurricular activity students wouldn't have time to do their homework, students would be stressed out, and would lead students to think they are disappointments.

First, one of the reasons I dont agree with the principle's decision is because students wouldnt have time to complete his/her homework. Students with AP classes already learn enough in one day and need time outside of school to complete assignment. Asking for good grades when having no time at home is like asking for superpowers. For example, imagine coming home from soccer and having seven classes worth of homework due the next day. In addition only having five hours to complete it.

Your mom looks at the doctor and asks, ""He's been like this since he started soccer."" The doctor replies, ""Soccer? Is that why you don't have time?"" You have a flash back of when your principal announced that everybody will be taking an extracurricular class after school. ""Why dont you just drop out of soccer, then you will have more time after school,"" the doctor says. "" Because my principal is forcing us to take an extracurricular class and I have homework from every class, thats why Im too busy.""

Another reason that I disagree with the principals decision is because students will get stressed out. School can already be stressing enough and when you add better time managing, which activity you should take, and still getting enough sleep its asking for too much. Student will get stressed no matter what under those conditions. Stress can lead to many things like mental breakdowns and suicidal thoughts. For example, you come home with a lot of homework to do. You run upstairs to get started on the homework. Hours later you finished three and need two more assignments to be finished, but its nine o'clock already.""eek,"" the door squeaks and your dad pops out and says, ""Hey, lights out, go to bed"" you reply with, ""OK dad, good night."" A couple of weeks go by and each day the same thing happens, you have to much work and such little time. One day your teacher puts down your report card and says, "" I might have to call your parents. You haven't been turning in your assignments"". You go home and show your parents the report card. They look at you with a disappointment look. This is another reason why I disagree with the principal. More and more of this happens you find yourself crying because you can't do anything and it seems like your life is on repeat. One day you Say to yourself, ""If I were gone out of this life no one would care in fact people would be happy, so then I would never disappoint them again."" You go on to tie a noose and hang yourself.

On a Wednesday morning, you wake up knowing you didnt do all of your work. You go to school tired. You get to class a bit late because you didnt feel like speed walking. ""Beep,"" the announcements come on, ""This is you principal speaking, from now on you will no longer be forced to do an extracurricular activity instead you will go home like you used to.""Suddenly a burst of energy rushes out of you and you shout in joy, you realize that you arent the only one. The whole school is shouting, some people are even going down on their knees and crying of joy. Weeks go by and you are back to your old self except you have an eating disorder and a bad sleeping habit. Once again you are getting good grades and you dont have anymore bad thoughts in your head. ""Congratulations, you made it to the AB honor role. we are so proud of you!"" your parents say in harmony. In conclusion, I disagree with what the principal has decided because if we all had to participate in a extracurricular activity students wouldn't have time to do their homework, students would be stressed out, and would lead students to think they are disappointments.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
1006FE578078,"Making extracurricular activities mandatory for students is not a valid rule that should be enforced. I don't agree that all students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity, because whether students graduate or not shouldn't be determined by an extracurricular activity that they may or may not have done,and most of the students already do an out of school activity,and students shouldn't be forced to do something that they dont want to do.

So what, they didn't participate in an extracurricular activity, that shouldn't be a barrier for them to graduate. Just because they didn't take part in the chess club, or the yearbook committee doesn't mean that they should be held back. Someone could be the next Albert Einstein and focus on school so much that he didn't have time for extracurricular activities, but you decide to hold him back because of a silly little thing he didn't do. Whether students do extracurricular activities or not shouldn't determine if they proceed to learn new things. The administrators should look at their grades and their work habits. It does not make a valid reason for them to be robbed of their opportunity to be smarter, if they just didn't participate in an extracurricular activity.

What if you dont have time? Most students already do an after school activity like sports, or a youth group. Some students even do multiple sports and still balance that with school. So for them to try and balance their after school activities, school, and now an extracurricular activity, it would be chaos. Students already go through enough stress with peer pressure, and their grades, and maybe just problems at home, so they shouldn't have to worry about this too. For example, maybe some students want to get a scholarship through playing a sport,and maybe their really good and actually have a chance at getting one. If you enforce that rule they would have to focus less on their sport and more on the extracurricular activity. So students who already do after school activities dont really have time for an extracurricular activity.

What if you just don't want to? Some students have trouble socializing with others. So maybe they didn't apply for an activity because they just didn't want too. Some students also enjoy their free time, time where they can do homework, be on their electronic devices, or just take a nap. So they didn't want to do an extracurricular activity because they didn't want to give up their free time. Students shouldn't have to feel like they are forced to do something. I mean it is called extracurricular activity for a reason, because it's for extra credit, so it shouldn't be a mandatory thing that they have to do.

Students graduating shouldn't be decided by if they did an extracurricular activity or not,and the students who already do after school activities don't have time for for extracurricular things,and students should not have to be pressured to do something if its not mandatory, so I don't agree that students should have to take part in an extracurricular activity.

BEC88463148B,"I would agree and disagree, i would disagree beacuse some people dont like to play sport's or all of the activite's the princiapl as them to do and im not saying they should because what if some student's have after school things to do like they having a family problem or they have to leave the state but stuff like work in the yearbook and sever in the student council would be good to work on at school but in sport's its up to you or your parent's because if you get bad grades in school you cant play sports your just gonna have to bring your grade up and then play and stay on task when the teachers give you work assigment's.

A reason that i would agree on is that some student's need to work on stuff like this because it could help you out alot and it helps you communicate with other people make friend's and stuff like that but what i highly agree on is that you should listen to your princiapl and but for the playing sport's after i dont think people shouldnt have to do it if the dont want to because you cant force any body to sport's if they dont want to. anthore reason i would agree beacause i think the kid's should have a after school program to help them out what they need to be helped on for example math not to many people do good in it and they might need a little help on it.

A reason that i would agree is that because studentss get to choose on what they want to pick for the extracurricular activity but the one that i would pick is the sport which is football becasue ive been playing football for 4 years and im really good at it and think of myself of being one of the biggest athelte and thats what i would like to become when i grow up but students at the school should pick the one they like and noody should force them to pick anything if they dont want to.

Anthore reason why i would disagree is that why should the students have to choose if they had to choose one i would reccomend the work on the year book's and the other one would be is to do the sever on the student council but work on the year book sounds fun to do and i think the students should do that but its my opinion but if they wuld like to do something else they could no one is stoping them from do what they want and athore reason why i agree is because some school's would pick for you.

But highly agree that students should pick one to listen to there princiapl and they all should participate in at least on of them and i think if they dont participate in at least one of them tehn i think they should have conseqeunces becasue why would you not wanna participate and say if it would be like and test grade your grade would be like a F because your not participating durning the assigment that your princiapl gave you so my word to them would be you should so you can get a good grade.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
B3031E720297,"Many schools have after school activities like academic programs or sports teams for their students. All students should participate in after school activities because The athletics programs may help students, and clubs may help students with their academic work.

The sports programs schools have for students may increase the students self confidence, and learn how to work with others. Some students don't have enough self confidence to do other things in life as in meeting new people or working in a group in a school activity, but being apart of a team and working with others will improve social skills, confidence, Strength, and mindset on things. These students get a chance to be apart of something they feel much bigger than them, but there are also clubs that may help with academic work.

Other schools focus on academic work for their students because they want their student to be successful, and make their own decisions in life. They could be a scientist or a school math teacher ether way the school wants them to meet their goals the smart way. That's why they made clubs like homework clubs or the historic club. These clubs can help individuals become very successful in life.

9D1C26B1696F,"The Principal is making all the students participate in at least one extracurricular activity and while some people may think that this is the greatest thing,and that they are going to love it,others may think that this was a huge mistake and that they won't do any good for them. I think that people need to try an extracurricular activity to get a feel for it. Sure some students may try out for a sports team or a team in general,but they are never finding out their true potential and will leave it in the dust. I think the Principal should let all students take at least one extra curricular activity because you can make friends,find something you didn't know you were good at till now,and make a living out of it.

The principal should let everyone take a extra curricular activity is because you can make new friends. You can make new friends by talking to the people in your activity. You can find people and become friends by talking to them,becoming really close to them,and becoming friendly with them. You can also find people that you have in common. There's people that I have met that have the same likes,interests,and dislikes,and we became really great friends just by having a few things in common,so you guys should try finding someone and seeing if you have a lot of things in common with him or her. You can also find your future best friend or your soon to be best friend. You can find a person,hit it off with them,and become best friends in the long run just because of that one extra curricular activity. In conclusion I think you can make new friends in a extra curricular activity by being friendly,finding people who have the same likes and dislikes as you,and find a best friend.

Another reason the Principal should let students take one extra curricular activity because you might find something you didn't know you were good at. You can find something you didn't know you were good at because of the many options that schools have. Over fifty activities in schools around the world! From basketball,soccer,and football,form even cooking. Schools have something that might suit you. So if you don't like soccer or any sports,there's always cooking or Cosmetics. You can make teams and become popular and active. For sports such as soccer and softball,you can make the teams and get popular making a lot of friends in the process. You can make money by trying out for a sport. Once you get into high school,you can earn credits and even a college application which saves a lot of money. I think we should take an extracurricular activity because they have many options,you can be active and popular,and you can make or save money.

I think everyone should take at least one extra curricular activity because you can become know for the best basketball or best soccer player one day. Kobe Bryant and Micheal Jordan are perfect examples of people who started in basketball in probably high school as a extra curricular activity,to one of the Greatest players of all time. On the other Extra curricular activity come off as useless and left in the dust. People just take it for granted and just want the easy A.They don't try to discover their true potential and leave it in the dust. I think that an extra curricular activity is fun and may or may not get you famous,but on the other hand people just seem to abuse it's power.

In conclusion I think that the principal should let all students take at least one extra curricular activity just because if how fun it is. Taking an extra curricular activity means that you can make new friends and best friends,do something that you didn't know you were good at till now and become popular and active,and be famous just like other famous people around the globe. But one the other hand people just seem to not care. In conclusion I think that the principle should let students take at least one extra curricular activity but not make it a rule so that other people will not feel uncomferable and forced to take an extra curricular activity.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
A42D0D160547,"Dear Principal,

I strongly disagree with you all students should not have to participate in a extracurricular activity. Such as, participateing in sports,work on a yearbook, or serve as a student council.

Who would want to do a extracurricular activity when we already have seven hours of school that's over working us. If we have that added on to school a lot of students will be going to sleep in school. Studies show that in the U.S. 45% of students is going to sleep in school. So, why would you add an extra activity

So it can waste more of our energy? So we can go to sleep faster?

I strongly advise everyone not to do any type of sports. You will get sore from pratice,injured,break a bone, tear your A.C.L. or worser. Lke in football you can get seriously injured. Why yall want us to do a type of sport we can ge injured in? Studies show that 58% of students get injured by Participating in sports.

We should just and learn then to do the extracurricular activity. School is for learning right?

Working on a yearbook is just wasting our learning time while we could be learning about math,reading, or science. We can finsh the yearbook in one day so what's the point of makeing it an activity that's just takeing takeing time from our learning. Matter of fact you can just just select five or six people to do yhe yearbook it's no point of makeing it an activity. By the way way why start this early you should wait until June.

Serve as a student council? That's not even an activity that's just for one person so, why should that even be included as an activity? That's not a reason why everybody in the whole school do an extra activity in the school. That's just for that one person. That's not an reason why we should miss out of learning because of an student council. That one person should do that while we learning our education that will be great.

In conclusion, we should not have to an activity beacuase we come to school for to learn not to no extracurricular activity while we could be studying for the S.O.L. or matbe learning something new. We shouldn't waste time from our learning to do an extracurricular activity while we can be getting our education in an class. If we was to do that activity students will be fallling sleep in class, chance of being injured, chance of getting bone broken, tearing your A.C.L. and etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
E76389FF2E2B,"Has your school ever made you join extracurricular activities? If not that's totally okay! My school wants students to really get their hands on learning and exploring new things. Personally I think that's a great idea, because students are not only helping their selves stay busy but helping out their school. Because sometimes our school needs a little pick me up I think in some spots it could use a little makeover and that's okay. Some extracurricular activities you could do are, joining a sport, helping out with yearbooks and redecorate things, or you could even paint or rebuild some things too!

Joining a sport can take time away from doing homework or other things, but thats what being a student athlete is about! At some points it can be really rough and stressful but really it's preparing you for the stressful things in the future. You may not think joining a sport could help you or your school but in certain situations it really can. Some schools have put tons of money into sports like buying new equipment etc. So why not continue on of what people in the past have put money into. Joining sports can be a big deal but no matter what just think about how much you are helping out.

Another thing you could do is help out with yearbooks. Sometimes it can be really stressful for teachers, so why not lend another helping hand and see where it takes you. I mean you never know, they may really like the way you helped out and may ask you to do other things! You never know what the future holds. Not only can you help out with yearbooks, you could also help out by redecorating some things in your school. Just throw your opinion right in there! It could also turn into something you really enjoy and you could continue on with that. Then all you have left to do is say thank you to your principal.

If you enjoy painting or building and you want to help out, let someone know and your school can definitely help find something you can do to help. One thing you could build is a new desk for a teacher or if you have a civics teacher build them a stand so they can sit like a judge in court. You never know where this ability you have could take you so take it and roll with it. Also if teachers don't like their room color you could gather some other students and help repaint their classroom. See there is always an extracurricular activity for everyone! Don't give up on looking.

In so many ways you can help your school! That's why i totally agree with this decision that my principal has made. Because everyone gets a chance to show what they can do and how they can help. Sometimes you just have to throw your opinion in the mix and see what it turns out to be. This is why i love doing extracurricular activities! Show what you can do and do it. I believe in you!",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
CFE8C526400C,"Extracurricular Activities are like music; some people like it, others do not. The principal at my school has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree, for the students may be shy, busy, or have money problems at home.

To begin with, students could be shy. Being shy and put on the spot in front of a group could build anxiety or stress. If they work better alone, being apart of any extracurricular activity means that you work with other kids.

The students may not be athletic, or may not like the clubs the school offers.

For instance, if a student is shy and he or she has to work with a group and express ideas, or if they join a team and have to do certain tricks, their anxiety and stress may increase.

Also, children can be busy, they have a life outside of school just like everyone else.

They might have to take care of others.

When taking care of others its hard to go to a club or sport after school, because when you get home your tired from your long day .

That is not fare to the students because when they get home they will be tired, have to do homework, and take care of somebody.

The kids may have appointments, like doctors appointments dentist appointments, or therapy appointments.

Some appointments can be every night, depending on the circumstances but no one should miss their appointment.

For example, a students has therapy appointments three times a week with his therapist he should not have to miss his appointments for any club or sport.

In addition, kids may have money problems. They might not have a car, or money to get transportation. They probably do not walk home because by the time for them to leave it would be dark and their parents do not want them to walk home.

If they join a club they might have to buy a shirt, or if they join a team they might not have money for uniforms.

Specifically, if a student does not have transportation at home, and does not have money for other transportation, then he would not be able to go.

In conclusion, I do not think that having an extracurricular activity is needed for all students. I think this unfair, granted that they can build social skills, and spend less time on electronic devices.

They should not make every student participate in an extracurricular activity. Everyone does different things when the school day is over. Some students may not be very good at sports and others just might not be thrilled with this idea.

Students may not be interested in participating in an extracurricular activity. Every student likes and dislikes different things. Some students might love extracurricular activities but others may hate them and like doing there own thing after school. Students could find extracurricular activities boring. Everyone is interested in a variety of things ,and could find doing things outside of school boring or time consuming. Extracurricular activities could possibly put students under stress. Students already have to go to school and do the work that we get there. Doing extracurricular activities or things outside of school could make it hard to balance the two. Extracurricular activities could be good for some but they can also create a lot of problems.

Students are busy and have other priorities to do other then going to school and doing an extracurricular activity. Students could have homework or have tutoring to go to. Some just want to sleep in and relax and have the rest of the day to themselves. from personal experience going to tutoring lessons and managing homework and sports was really difficult. Students may have plans with family and friends. Practices and meetings can take away time from students hanging out with friends and family and wanting to spend quality time with them. Students could become very tired and sleep deprived with managing school and an extracurricular activity. Students could be extremely tired and not want to go to practice or school because they havent gotten enough time to rest. Extracurricular activities can interfere with our personal lives outside of school.

Extracurricular activities should not be mandatory for a lot of reasons. Extracurricular activities should not be mandatory because every student may not be interested in the activities.

97A05BD1708D,"My principal, Mr. Generic_Name, has just announced that all students are required to participate in one activity around the school. I think that is is a great idea for Middle and Elementary school! But some of the students don't like the idea as much. I agree with my principal's decision to require at least one extracurricular activity. Whether it's encouraging students to learn something new that they like, getting to know others and making friends, or to spark a new hobby/interest. Here are my reasons and elaboration as to why I think this.

My first reason is that some of your time in Middle School should be spent doing something that you enjoy learning. The Loudoun Times have written about other schools doing the same change as what Mr. Generic_Name just announced. A writer for the Loudoun Times interviewed students at one school and 1 out of 5 students interviewed didn't like the idea at first, but when the interview happened again in the middle of the school year, that ratio changed to 4 out of 5.

Another reason why at least one extra curricular activity is good, is that you get to know others and make friends! CBS reported on a camp that was held in the Summer for exactly one week, which had kids aged 11 to 14 from 10am to 7pm, with 23 kids total, and activities of hiking, four square, camping, and more. All of the students except one had reported making at least one friends that they, later on in the camp, gave contact information to. I know this isn't in a school setting, but this proves that students can be the same way when doing a fun activity that they signed up for. If you like Tennis for example, you can play with other people in Tennis that share the same interest.

The last sentence brings me to my next reason, which is sparking a new hobby/interest. The University of Virginia had 20 8th graders choose something new to learn. The options were, Guitar, Tennis, and Basketball. 16 out of 20 8th graders liked what they chose. The next day, having all of the 20 8th graders either choose something new, or choose something different, 13 out of 20 choose the same option that they chose yesterday. One student when interviewed, said that he liked Guitar and hoped he could learn more about it in the future. That one student probably now has a new interest of Guitar as well as the other students who chose their activity for both of the two days. The people who chose the activity for only one day at least have an idea of what isn't for them.

I have just told you my reasoning! My 3 reasons have now told you why I support Mr. Generic_Name's decision of requiring at least one extracurricular activity. Making friends, getting to know other people, sparking a new interest, and having people choose something that they just want to see if it's for them. At least one of these reasons can help students when choosing their activity and make them feel better. Mr. Generic_Name clearly made the best choice for our school.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
5F99013AD518,"Extracurricular activities are a large part of many student's lives. Extracurricular activities build friendships and a sense of community.

There are many benefits to participating in these activities. It is a good idea for students to be required to participate in at least one team or club. All students should participate in extracurricular activities because they encourage healthy lifestyles and stronger communities.

Activities like sports promote a healthy lifestyle. They include lots of physical activity which is something many people aren't getting enough of. Exercise is very important for children and teens. It has been proven that participating in some sort of club or team also decreases the risk of joining a gang. These activities also promote mental health. They send many positive messages to students. Clubs and teams build strong communities and friendships, which can help improve mental health.

Extracurricular activities make a stronger sense of community between students.

Activities like sports and student council are great ways to make friends and find new interests. They can help students meet people with similar interests. Many kids find it easier to make friends with people they can relate to. That is why extracurricular activities are such a great opportunity to build friendships.

Not only are extracurricular activities healthy, they are also fun! I love playing sports and getting to do what I love with my friends. By participating in extracurricular activities, you can find new hobbies that you enjoy. You can explore a variety of fun activities when you join. Extracurricular activities are a great way to have some fun with friends while also exploring your interests.

All students should join an extracurricular activity because they help students live healthy lives and be more connected within their community.

Would you participate in extra activity if you were force to do it? Well ,the principle is thinking that student's must participate in extra activity. I disagree,because some kids don't want to do activities,and some students are too shy to be with other students.

Some student choose not to because of reasons. Some kid have strong reason why not to participate. It should be a students chose weather or not to participate in these stuff.

Some student have inanity or they are shy to be with other people. inanity is an problem to many specially with other people. Some student are shy and don't make many friends and when they do activity they don't have people to talk to. Shy people have rick of being bulled when doing things wrong.

99B650C97618,"Has your principle ever said you had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Well my principle has, and I think students just want to chill sometimes. My mom needs me after school to help her with my baby brother. I am against this because you may want to spend time with family, you may have to do something after school, and the people your working with in the activity are not working or helping you.

To begin with, you may have to do something out side of school, like you and your house hold have to go out of town. Most of the time, kids leave there room messy in the morning when picking out their clothes so after school they have to clean their room. Or, you might have a appointment after school. And sometimes, students have to work after school or help their mom or dad with work.

Also, you may want to spend time with your family. A family member or friend could be very sick and that could be the last time you see them. Sometimes, your parents have split up and you are on a weekly play when you get to see your mother or father. Often, you may want to have a meet because your friend of family member has past away.

Finally, the people your working with are not doing their part. Most of the time, I get put in a activity group with students that are lazy and get off task easily by others. Often, you or the students your working with may not get along, or maybe had issues in the past. Sometimes, I have students in my activity group that play around too much. Or, they may not be good at what the activity is and not do any work.

5AB3EDABE80F,"Imagine that you have a job after school, right after school goes out. But your school now requires you to take an extracurricular activity. You get fired from that job and all because of your school. This is what would happen to many people if schools mandated after school activities. I pick up my brother from his bus stop every day and if I had after school activities there would be no-one to pick him up. I think schools should not force students to take an extracurricular because of Jobs, People, and Time.

One of the reasons schools should not force students to take an extracurricular is Jobs. Some students have jobs after school. They might have to work to help support their family. If you made them take after school activities then they wont be able to make it to work on time most of the time and get fired. Nothing good would come of that situation.

Another reason is people like friends or family. As I said before, I pick my brother up from his bus stop every day. I also have friends that need to do the same thing. My mom has to go to work and my dad works from home so I'm the only one that can pick him up all the time. Same thing with my friend who also picks his brother up every day. If either of us had to do an extracurricular we wouldnt be able to pick up our siblings. Students also have plans after school with their friends, or maybe they are going on a trip with family. If they where forced into an extracurricular they would not have as much time to hang out with their friends or go places with family. They might be late to wherever they were going.

The last reason is time. Some students just simply dont have enough time every day to do an extracurricular. They might have clubs after school, or they might play on a sports team. Not everyone has that much free time after school. They have homework, eat, spend time on hobbies, etc. But an extracurricular takes another couple hours out of your day, thats less time to do all those things.

There are also arguments for students being forced into an extracurricular but I feel like students should have a choice because everyone is under different circumstances.

Card Stacking

Whether you have a job, a sibling to pick up, or plans with friends, you could be stopped from doing any of those things by the mandating of extracurricular activities.

Call to Action

So next time you have a chance to influence a decision about this topic, make sure you make it so that there are no forced after school activities.

Restate Thesis

That's why I think you should not make students take extracurricular.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
1BB9080C5E67,"I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, for students can learn to be more social, learn new skills, and encourage students in school. Being in no extracurricular activities is like being a baseball with no bat; no fun!

First, students can learn to be more social. For example, meeting a new girl at school and your wearing a new pair of shoes and she walks up to you and goes, ""I really like your shoes, where did you get them?"" They would have to be able to talk back to him or her. Obviously you do not just ignore someone. Whether you are too nervous to talk, you will be constantly communicating in your extracurricular activity all the time so that would be something students learn. Which is talking to new and different people. Some would say bringing you out of your ""shell.""

Also, students can learn new skills from being in a extracurricular activity. Like playing a sport such as soccer you would be learning how to kick the ball, building higher endurance from running. Or maybe other students would like to be in a real council one day you could join the student council and learn and talk all about it. There are many extracurricular activities you can join so the students certainly have options.

Then, doing extracurricular activities can encourage students in school. Behavior wise, you wouldn't want to be disrespectful and let the coach or teacher make you do anything extra as punishment. Students would always be keeping up with their grades because of the fact that they could get kicked out of that activity. Students would probably show up to school more often because of the extracurricular their in they cannot miss too many days.

However, not all students have the time of day to participate in these extracurricular activities for whatever reason. Possibly, no ride home, but there will always be an activity bus to come pick them up. Or maybe the students are babysitting after school. I think that you would need to participate in some kind of extracurricular activity or even try your best to.

Finally, extracurricular activities can bring so much more fun into your life. Whether its playing a sport or joining the student council make sure it is something that you enjoy. So I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, for students can learn how to socialize, learn new skills, and encourage students in school",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
DD769E98B1FF,"Extracurricular activities get you involved with the people and around you and your entire community no matter which one you choose.

Sports are a good extracurricular activity to try.

Another good option is joining the theater.

Lastly, another good option would be joining any musical program offered by your school.

All of these options I have presented offer many benefits.

Sports are a good extracurricular activity to try.

There is such a large variety of sports for you to try that you will always find something that you enjoy.

If you play any sport then you get the chance to meet a lot of new people.

When playing sports you travel a lot and would get to experience lots of new things.

Playing sports opens up so many more opportunities for anyone, no matter the sport.

Another option would be getting involved with a theater.

While part of a theater you get to experience either being the star of the show or working quietly backstage.

Some theaters travel to perform their shows, sometimes to famous places.

You could make new friends with either your fellow actors or actresses or the stage crew.

Theater is another great way to get involved with extracurricular activities and generally have a great time.

Lastly, getting involved with music programs is another great way to get involved with extracurricular activities.

Music is a fun way to be as creative as you want and perform in front of people.

Whether you are a soloist or part of a group you would get to make plenty of new friends.

Music programs generally travel quite frequently which lets everyone try new things and meet people they otherwise would never meet.

Music programs are another great way to get involved with extracurricular activities.

In conclusion, these are all of my reasons to join the extracurricular activities that I told you about.

There are plenty more activities than the ones that I have previously stated but they all will benefit you in some way.

I agree with this principle and think that others should follow them.

Extracurricular activities benefit all types of people and I think you should give some a try.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
2056B171116E,"""Oh come on!"" groans one of the students. All of the students have just been told that joining an extracurricular is now required. They are all upset now, but little do they know that they will be eternally grateful for it in the future. Making extracurricular activities required was a great decision. Students will have a beneficial learning experience, a better school experience, and gain guidance that can help them in the future.

Joining an extracurricular gives you a great learning experience. One of the benefits is new knowledge. Extracurricular activities teach you things that you would not learn in class, and that can be useful later. Some people argue that students will not have time for an extracurricular activity to be added to their schedule. However, classes can be adjusted so students have time for the activity if that is really the case. In most cases, students need better time management. They can learn this as they will need to be able to balance their schoolwork, their extracurricular, and anything else they may need to do regularly. Students will learn to manage their time wisely as a result of the added extracurricular, which is another benefit they will receive. Being apart of an extracurricular can also improve students' social skills. It gives you the opportunity to learn how to work responsibly and productively with others. Extracurricular activities give you new knowledge, time management skills, and social skills, which makes being apart of one a great learning experience.

Extracurricular activities can give you a better school experience. Extracurricular activities can make students happier and give them a good memory of school. Being apart of club they enjoy gives them something to look forward to. They can also help students step out of their comfort zone. Being required to take an extracurricular encourages them to try something they might not have tried otherwise. Joining an extracurricular can also help students meet new people as well. They can become friends with peers who share the same interests as them. Extracurricular activities can make school a place that students look forward to going to.

Extracurricular activities benefit students in ways that will help them in the future greatly. These activities can help students find out their interests. When they join different types of extracurricular activities, they can figure out what they enjoy doing, and what they are not interested in. This can lead to them finding their career path. By trying new things, they can find out what they are passionate about. Having tried different things and learned about them can also make a student stand out. If students continue to be apart of extracurricular activities in high school, it will help them get noticed by colleges. Extracurricular activities impact its students' futures for the better.

Making extracurricular activities required will positively influence students in many ways. They will help teach students skills that can help them for a lifetime. They will also give the students a more positive experience at school, and a better view of it. Lastly, extracurricular activities give them even more benefits that can help them in their near future. If students do not participate in extracurricular activities, so much talent and opportunities they could have had will go to complete waste.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
18CF13F4818D,"Many students play a sport or are involved with an activity such as a club, student council, and even NJHS (National Junior Honors Society) as well as other in school or outside of school activities. Most students go home everyday and relax the whole time and don't feel the need to exercise or do anything. This can start to take affect on their health and mental well being or even cause them to not care about school as much as to say someone who plays a sport for their school and attends clubs after school. I agree that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity or multiple activities of their choice for the benefit of their health and mental well being, to give them something extra to do after school or even an activity they love, and to help some students that are struggling and need the support or can help widen and better understand certain subjects they like to study and learn about.

Playing a sport is a healthy and enjoyable thing to add to your life. Sports help increase your endurance, muscle tone, overall health, and even helps you lose weight. Students who play sports tend to be less tired during the day and are much healthier than say a student who stays inside all day and doesn't play outside with friends or plays a sport. By adding a sport to your life, it gives you plenty of exercise and workouts each day and allows you to keep in shape and stay healthy.

When school is over, many students only think about how they're going to relax that day or what they're going to eat as soon as they get home. Most students don't really have much to do the rest of their day and often get bored most days after school. By doing an extracurricular activity such as a sport or club, it allows you to eliminate that boredom and have something to do either everyday or at least a few times a week. You can have something to look forward to everyday at least and can do something you love instead of sitting on the couch waiting for tomorrow to come. It's best to choose an activity you really like, by doing something you love, it makes it both enjoyable and makes you feel less stressful since it's an activity you really like and enjoy.

Some students find school very challenging or have mental disabilities that prevent them from easily completing school and gives them challenges they have to figure out how to overcome. School clubs such as homework clubs or even clubs that are dedicated to a specific subject or idea can help a student really understand the content they're learning about and help make it easier to focus in class and not struggle as much. Clubs that are dedicated to certain ideas or subjects often learn more about that subject or idea because of the fact that it mainly focuses on specific content or a wide range of data related to a certain genre. By joining a club, you immediately learn more than you would in a class because it's a more open learning environment and different people share their knowledge instead of maybe 1 teacher.

I do agree that our principal should make all students participate in an extracurricular activity because of the benefits for your health and mental well being, to give them something extra to do after school or even an activity they love, and to help some students that are struggling and need the support or can help widen and better understand certain subjects they like to study and learn about. Everyone should find an activity they love to do and add it to their life to benefit them even if it's multiple activities.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
77351280D0B0,"Over 60% of students who participate in extracurricular activities have a better chance of getting into college and getting a good job. My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision because students would get more experience in school, they would become more productive, and parents would have more time to work.

One reason why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, is because students would gain experience from it. If students participate in extracurricular activities they could gain experience from the the things they learned and the mistakes they made. For example, I am part of The Ambassadors Club, and this program has taught me how to manage my time, how to work with other people, and how to efficiently get work done, which I will need as I'm growing up. Students would get new experience if they participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Another reason why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, is because it will help the students become more productive. Most students at home have nothing to do, so they fill that time up by going on their phones, playing video games, or getting into trouble. One example would be myself because I am lazy, and I love to procrastinate. I would usually get my work done last minute, and I would always do the bare minimum. So, I decided to join a club at school, and I chose Drama Club. The club was very fun and exciting, and I learned a lot of new acting skills. Ever since I joined the Drama Club I have stopped procrastinating, and I have been more productive in school and at home. I believe that if students participate in at least one extracurricular activity they would be become more productive and would stay out of trouble.

My last reason why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, is because it would give their parents more time to work. Many students have parents who work long hours, and their parents might have to hire a babysitter or might have to enroll their child into daycare, which both are very expensive. Parents might not have enough money to provide their children with a babysitter or day care, so they have to get off work early so they can take care of their child/children. For example, my sister, who goes to the same school as me, comes home at around 2:30 pm, but my parents don't come home until around 4:00 pm. So our parents had to hire a babysitter, but all of the babysitters were to expensive, so our parents had to get off of work early just to take care of her and to make sure that she is safe. After a month of leaving work early, my mom signed my sister up for Step Team, which my sister says is really fun. Now my parents don't have to leave work early because of the extra hour and a half that my sister is at Step Team. If students participate in at least one extracurricular activity their parents would be able to work more, and they would be able to earn more money to provide for their children.

All in all, parents would have more time to work, students would be more productive, and they would get more experience if students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. However, some people might think the new system is bad because students would want to relax or hang out with friends, but I believe that their are a lot more positive effects if students participate in an extracurricular activity. In conclusion, with this new system many parents will benefit from it, and many students will benefit from the new system as well.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
F1A1CB2EB831,"Wouldn't it be awesome to always have something to do at the end of a long boring school day. Extracurricular activities give you that chance. I believe that everyone should be a part of at least one extracurricular activity every school year. I think this because of all the benefits. Also, every extracurricular activity has a different advantage. The extracurricular activities I think everyone should be a part of are: sports, academic, and different clubs.

The first, and my personal favorite, extracurricular activity is sports teams. Sports teams create a way for kids to get exercise. Kids are recommended to exercise 60 minutes each day. Joining a sports team ensures that you reach that goal. Not only would it be healthy, but the student would feel good about him/herself. Teamwork is also and benefit to joining a sports team. Teamwork is one of the most important skills. It's one of the the only skills people absolutely need to be successful in life. Sports teams are one of the best ways to practice and get better at that skill. Another skill acquired in sports teams is leadership. In sports teams leadership is always a reoccurring skill. You also need to show leadership throughout you life, similar to teamwork. Some may be a bit shy and not necessarily know how to correctly take a lead in situations, but sports teams could definitely fix that. To think this is only one of the types of extracurricular activities to choose from, doesn't it already seem worth your time?

The next option for an extracurricular activity is the academic workshops you're able to join. Academic workshops and clubs can push students to do better. In these academic workshops you surround yourself with people who want to be better, and are better than you. Surrounding yourself with people who are better than you encourages you to do better for yourself and pride. Academic workshops may also improve your grades a little or a lot depending on how dedicated you are to do so. There are workshops like homework club that help students who need a little more help and guidance than others. If these particular students participate in these types of things, they're sure to see and improvement anytime soon.

Lastly, there are so many different types of clubs any student could be a part of and interested in. Everybody should try something new every once in a while. The different clubs that schools have are the perfect opportunity. I'm going to introduce you to two of the clubs that sparked my interest. First is the yearbook club. Doesn't it just sound fun by its name? Wouldn't you want to be a part of the book that everyone raves about at the end of the year? You get to take pictures, make fun subtitles/caption, and so much more. Sometimes you even get extra credit for it. Seems like a deal breaker to me. Then there's student council. This is probably my favorite clubs to be a part of. It's very intriguing to see what it's like to be somewhat of a politician. Student council is also an awesome opportunity to show your teamwork and leadership skills strengthened by sports teams. Besides, wouldn't it be fun to basically be at the head of the school. Think about it, these are just two of the hundreds of clubs you're able to choose from.

I believe every student should be a part of at least one extracurricular activity. Sports teams help push exercise, and strengthen teamwork and leadership. Academic workshops encourage better grades and motivates students to do better. There are also opportunities for student to try new things with the different types of clubs. Think of how well rounded a student would be by participating in one of these extracurricular activities every school year. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
4B598963BE1E,"Close your eyes and imagine that it is your junior year in high school. You are sitting in a disorganized mess trying to figure out what to put on your college resume before the deadline, which happens to be in exactly two hours. This could have been prevented if you had actually done any extracurricular activities in the past. To prevent these types of scenarios, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can give them future opportunities, make them gain many skills, and help them find a passion to pursue.

Everyone wants many opportunities in life, and extracurricular activities do just that. If you play an instrument, you can travel abroad to play your favorite pieces. You can join competitions and get recognized so that orchestras and symphonies ask you to play with them. It is not just playing an instrument that can get you opportunities, but sports too. If your team makes championships, you both can travel places for that competition. We cannot forget about college scouts either. If they see you play and they think you are good enough to be on their team, then they could give you a full-ride scholarship to their school. If that is not an amazing opportunity, then I don't know what is.

The next reason why students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they can learn many valuable skills they will need in the future. In leadership clubs like National Honor Society or your school's student council, you can learn how to communicate with people and get your ideas out. You can also learn to lead people, plan or organize events, and help your community. You can even overcome almost everyone's biggest fear, public speaking. That is definitely a huge benefit. With sports, you can also not only build up your communication skills, but also learn to collaborate by becoming a team player. If you are in a chess club, you can gain patience and critical thinking skills which will definitely help you in the future.

The last reason why all students should participate in extracurricular activities is so that they can find a passion to pursue. Sometimes, people do not always know what they want to do or become someday and extracurricular activities just happen to help with that. By doing them, you can find out your interests and hobbies, what you are good and bad at, and what abilities you posses. If you love that sport or that instrument, pursue it! Work harder than anyone, and you just might find yourself in the Olympics. Practice with your whole heart and soul and next thing you know, you could be inviting your family to come see you perform with the National Symphony. The point is, all these passions can start from you just wanting to try out an activity.

Overall, students should definitely participate in extracurricular activities. These activities can bring you many opportunities, valuable skills, and help you pursue a passion you never knew you had. There are so many more reasons to participate in extracurricular activities, but these are some of the most beneficial ones. If you had chosen any of the hundreds of extracurricular activities available, you would not be frantically trying to finish up your college resume two hours before it is due. Instead, you could have been stress free doing what you love the most.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
686A0D833422,"The principle at Generic_School has decided that all of his students shall participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as sports, and clubs. There are many clubs the students may vary from. Some of the sports here at Generic_School Middle School include soccer, tennis, football, baseball, softball, majorette, dance, field hockey, track, cheer leading, and wrestling. The principle here at Generic_School

Middle school should have all of his students in some type of extracurricular activity. So students can socialize more.

Many of the clubs here at Generic_School require good grades and very good behavior and all of you are capable of achieving that. So there is no excuse why you should disagree with what our principle has decided. This is a very great idea and hopefully it will last as long as it can. Generic_School has many fun choices to choose from but it's up to you to choose which club best suits you.

The reason why the principle came up with the decision is because not many students get to socialize with others in school. There are a variate of sports to choose from. Generic_School also has a special place for each of the many sports. Another good thing is that you also get to socialize wit the high school students on your team. That is one reason why its agreeable to have every student doing extracurricular activities.

D4494228C749,"Say your principle has made a new rule this year that you must participate in a minimum of one after school activity. This means it will force kids to take action and try something new with a extracurricular activity. I hope my school does this because it will cause students to make new friends, it gets you more involved in the school and the programs that they offer, and it is something new to try.

My first reason why this would be a good idea is because students will make new friends. We all know there are some of those kids that are anti social and do not like to talk to that many people. But if you force them to do an after school activity, they will make new friends in that program. This can make their self esteem rise as their circle of friends grows. Even if you are not one of those anti social people, you can still meet many different types of people annd make cool friends. If you are taking the same after school activity, that mean you guys both like that same thing. This will make it even easier to meet new people that share your interests.

My second reason why this would be a good decision by your principle is because it gets you more involved in the school and the programs that they offer. By some peoples senior year, there may be some seniors that took so many after school activities, that the school loves them because it shows how much they want to learn and get involved. You may get an award at graduation or some recongnition for participating in so many extracurricular activities. I know someone who does a sport, works on the yearbook, and is on the debate team. This shows they want to learn and is a good sign for the teachers at the school. This represents to teachers that he is a well rounded student. Most extracurricular activites also go on your high school trans script. This means colleges will see you were involved with many programs at your high school and it will strengthen your chance to get into better colleges.

My third and final reason why this rule should be added by your principal is because it is something new to try. Maybe you have never even thought about going on the debate team because you thought you would never like that. You try it anyways because of this new rule and you turn out to be really good at it and now you have a new hobby. With this new rule forcing students to take part in extracurricular activities, it can expand someones personality by trying things they would never have tried before. It is always good to try new things because it can give you an idea of things that you like and do not like. By trying new things out in after school activities, it will help shape what you want to do with your life as you go through high school.

There are really no bad things that can happen with after school activities. You may get stuck in something that you do not like that much, but that is just practicing perserverance and determination. hope my principle will add this new rule forcing students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It will cause students to make new friends, it gets you more involved in the school and the programs that they offer, and it is something new to try.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
F6FF5119789B,"Your principal has decided that all student must participate in or at least one extracurricular activity. Do you agree with this? I agree with the principal because kids need to get out and make new friends, learn how to work with others and do better in school.

One reason, to make friends can help you because you will see life in there or a different way. You can learn new things about them. Let's say you guys are playing basketball an one of the boys did a lay up, you can teach or show them a different type of move they can do in basketball like how to shoot when you are 6ft away from the net and not miss. It can help prove your low self stream and help you become brave or bold because you know that your friends will have your back. There was this one thing when my school sister(friend) cyan had my back when there was people picking on me about my shoes in 7th grade she told them to leave me alone and you are so mean and rude. From that day on we are still the best of friends/ school sister.

For an example, you can learn how to work with others. Learn from other people can teach you new things.

Like cooking someone can show you or teach you they recipes and you can do the same. A lot of people have a different ways of see things like in photographer you have one way of seem one thing and someone else can see a another way, but if you can put or come together with both ideas you guys can both make a amazing picture. Work together mean there will have to be teamwork like everyone has a job to do to get the work done and they can feel like the are part of this team.

Finally, do better in school. Extracurricular activity can help you in school because some of this activity you will need to have good grades in your classes in order to be there. I know in basketball and cheer you can't get in trouble like get in fight, suspicion and get bad grades. Yes it must seem a lot of work but it not, but real it's a lot of fun. Your attitude will be much better and so will your attendance.

At lastly, make new friends, learn how to work with others, and do better in school. Your principal has decided that all student must participate in or at least one extracurricular activity. I belive that by do this we can make the world a better place. WARNING: You will have lots of fun.        ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
78422FE10011,"These days, before deeming them worthy of an acceptance letter, colleges take many aspects of a students life, into consideration. Many think colleges only look at grades and test scores, when that is not the case.

Although, grades and test scores are crucial to admission, they aren't the only thing colleges look at. Extracurricular activities are a great way to stand out to colleges. Many students shy away from participating in extracurricular activities because they aren't aware of the benefits. Requiring students to participate in them would eliminate future grievances.

Leadership skills, passion, and being well-rounded are all things colleges look for in students.

Colleges absolutely love having notable alumni; which is why, they look for pupils with many examples of leadership.

Schools offer various opportunities to show off those skills.

One popular example is sports.

What says leadership better than being team captain?

Sports are also a common way to receive scholarships.

Last year, someone on the Riverside Baseball Team got into Princeton. It is very likely they got in because of their performance on the baseball team. He probably wouldn't have gotten into Princeton if he hadn't played baseball. The Riverside Baseball player is a key example of how extracurricular activities are beneficial to students. If one isn't athletic, sports are not the only option.

Being the president, treasurer, or even secretary, of a club are wonderful positions to show leadership.

My older sister was the treasurer of Humanity First in her junior year and the president in her senior year; she was accepted into Duke.

It is highly likely that if she wasn't president, or treasurer, she wouldn't have been admitted. Leadership skills are vital for college acceptance, and requiring extracurricular activities would help students showcase them.

Passionate people are sought out by colleges, and extracurricular activities are a great way to show passion. Passionate people are often very committed.

Colleges want active members of society in their schools, not people who sign up for activities to be able to say they were apart of them.

Colleges know when someone signs up for a club just because they think it'll look good for college. They want people to sign up for a club because they genuinely enjoy its purpose, and not because of what it'll look like on an application. Colleges want active club members; not club members who barely go to meetings. Participating in marching band for all four years shows commitment, passion, and loyalty. Colleges want those attributes, so they are assured their students won't leave them for another college, and if they decided their major, they will stick with it. Required extracurricular activities would help students find their passions, and they would no longer wander aimlessly in life. Extracurricular activities show colleges passion, and passion is rare among teenagers. Often, passionate people go on to do great things in the world, and colleges want to have notable alumni.

Contrary to popular belief, GPA and test scores aren't everything.

Sure, they are very helpful and important on transcripts, but there are other factors colleges look at as well.

Colleges like well-rounded people.

This could be linked to the fact that American colleges allow their students to change their majors. If a person is well-rounded, then it is more likely that if they change their major to something completely different, they will not fail.

Being an active member in extracurricular activities shows that the person is not just good at memorizing notes, but that they are also able to partake in deeper thinking. Colleges want people that can use all of their brain, and not just one side of it. If someone had a perfect SAT/ACT score, a 5.0 GPA, and no extracurricular activities, they would probably not be chosen over someone with an SAT score of 1539, a 4.35 GPA and multiple extracurricular activities.

Required extracurricular activities would stop the person with a perfect SAT/ACT score and a 5.0 GPA from losing their spot to someone academically inferior who had more extracurricular activities. In terms of roundness, colleges want circles, not triangles.

Required extracurricular activities would benefit everyone. Leadership skills, passion, and appearing well rounded would enhance anyone's chances of getting into college and receiving scholarships.

65F8264950AD,"I agree because they can do at least one activity for school like a sport,clubs,even staying after for a teacher. Things like that people should stayed after school to finish a test or finish project things like this people should do.

Things i'll so if i stayed after school will be homeworke,sports things maybe helping out with the school staying after school will be helpful sometimes to you and sometimes to the school and it can be helpful to get your grades up and all of that stuff. Staying after is like useing your time on your stuff that are helpful.

The other reasons why people stayed after school is for sports and clubs these are the most common things that people stay after is sports and clubs. clubs are things that are fun to do and more active in the school thing some of these stuff is more doing something for the school or you. Sports are mostly playing for your team or school sometimes people do it for fun and try get to people to like it and try to play the sport or some other sport try to be good at it and have a future with the sport that you use to played on.

do have a students who is struggling in school due to lack of knowledge and understatement? Staying after school for an educational extracurricular can and will help students do better in school. I have taken a language and struggled to understand and comprehend it, but at my school they provide us with after school clubs that are also extracurricular's. So one day I decided to stay after for a french extracurricular that I ended up really enjoying, so I started to go every day that it was offered, I started realized how much of an impact it made on my grade I went from having a C to an A. This is one of the many impacts an educational extracurricular activity can have of your students.

Have you ever been really interested in a sport but not knowing how to play it?

If you think about it, Labron James was not always as amazing of a basketball player as he is now. The reason he is so good is because of how much time, effort and motivation he put into his practices. Staying after for a sport can put you on your path to being able to succeed to doing well at the sport. That is why it is so important to have after school sport extracurricular activities to help students who have a dream of playing the sport professionally accomplish it.

Students who feel more stressed out from school or home are less likely to do as well in school as others. Students who have parents who make them do homework as soon as they get home without a break feel more stressed, and probably wont put in as much effort as they would is they got a break. At my school they provide us with after school downtime clubs to help students relive their mind. It also helps students get the break that is needed form a hard working day at school, and students are more likely to have better grade outcomes.

This is why is it good for students to be required to do at least on extracurricular activity after school. They will help students do better in school, help students who are interested in playing any sports get better, and will help students who are stressed from school feel more relived. So next time you doubt what amazing powers of extracurricular activities remember how much of great of an effect it can have on students.     ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
B2F51A10762D,"Do you believe in being active or socializing. Many people dont like to do extracurricular activities. I agree that all students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because the students can make new friends or have the opportunity to get in shape.

One of the reasons you have to do an extracurricular activity is you can make friends. For example, you can talk to other students while you help make the yearbook or play in teams in a sport. My Cousin used to be super shy, but when he played in extracurricular activities he made plenty of friends.

Another reason to do an extracurricular activity is that you can get in shape. For example, if your extracurricular activity is sports you can work out your muscles. My sister used to hate her body, until she chose track as an extracurricular activity and started to losing weight.

Many people love to play sports or help make yearbooks. Extracurricular activities are very helpful. I agree that students should do at least one extracurricular activity because the students can get in shape or can make friends.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
D35C1DDA7658,"Imagine the sound of the school bell ringing, freedom, time to go home, it is a Friday after all, you get to go home and relax; but then you remember the new rule, all students must be signed up for an extra curricular activity. There goes another hour of my free time you mutter as you slowly walk towards your robotics club. Kids should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity. Most kids have other priorities whether it is limited time, or not wanting to be in a club, to even the stress of being forced into a social environment.

There is only one thing that is limited for every single person on the planet and that is time. Many kids feel that they dont have enough time already and if forced to join a club that only meets once a week for an hour that just cuts an hour off their free time that they could be doing other things. Many kids participate in a sports that are very time consuming. Most combative sports have multiple practices and games a week, along with practicing on your own. Another very time consuming part of every child's life is family, spending time with grand parents or even just having fun with your parents or siblings. Your family is the most important thing in your life and any time you can spend with them should be spent with them, not at school in leadership council. Finally your friends, every kid has a friend group and friends are a very important of every kids life. Your friends are who you go to for advice and who you learn many life lessons from.

A huge part of middle school life is stress. It is impossible to never experience it about something. Homework is very stressful, having math, Spanish, science, English, and civics homework that is all due on one day is crazy, especially if you have less time than you usually would. Most kids have an hour and a half of homework each night with some nights being more. Imagine not getting home until 4:30 then having another hour and a half of homework, that means if you are focused and you can get your work done you don't have any free time until 6:00. Pets are another thing that stress many kids out. Knowing that you have to hurry home to let your dog out is stressful, and it is made much worse when you have to wait another hour before you can leave school. Another reason that kids shouldn't be forced to participate in clubs is the amount of kids with social anxiety. Many kids freak out at hearing that they are going to have to go out into public once, much less every week. If kids want to be in clubs they can but it isn't fair to make that a requirement.

To close, most kids who want to be in a club are in a club. Most of the kids who aren't in a club dont want to be and there is no reason to force those who would rather be at home with their family or having fun with their friends to be somewhere they don't want to be. Simply people have better things to do then be in a room with a ton of other people doing something that they aren't interested in. Clubs are great for kids that are interested in them and for kids who do want to be there, but when you add in a ton of students who would rather be elsewhere doing their own thing it just makes everything worse. Also there isn't enough space for everybody to be in their preferred club so there would be angry kids and parents demanding that they signed up for a different club then the one they are in.

Kids shouldnt be required to be in an extra curricular activity if they don't want to be. Students have more important things to do with their time, they have many different things causing them stress and most importantly they don't want to be in a club. There is no need to overcrowd clubs with grumpy kids that ruin everything for the kids who signed up to be there.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
DDEECCE96A13,"Extracurriculars have many things that can benefit you in the present day and later in your future, which is why all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Doing these activities can be great exercise mentally and physically, be an awesome learning experience and help with future life skills.

Programs like sports or academic clubs can be great way to exercise. Sports are a great way to build muscle and exercise physically, while academic clubs are also great exercise, but for your brain and building problem-solving skills. Going to these extracurriculars are the perfect thing for your brain to do that doesn't involve a cellphone. Sports and other activities are a very productive thing to do for your brain but are also fun to do. Another thing extracurriculars can do is relieve stress in a good way. Running around or doing something you love can relieve stress from school and other things that happen in life.

Doing an extra activity can be a great learning experience teenagers. The activities can give you something new to learn, like a new dance combination or how to use a computer in the yearbook club. Participating in these activities can also be an easy way to find a new hobby that you love doing. Being in a program like yearbook or helping with special education classes can be a way for you to volunteer your time to someone who needs it. Giving your time to someone can feel good as well as give you role models to look up to, like your coach or teacher. It also feels good to be part of a group or team because your group has a lot of people with the same interests as you all in one place. All of these activities can also give you skills that will help you later in adulthood.

One last thing extracurriculars can do for you is they can develop some very helpful skills for your future. Being in a group of people that already have the same interests as you can be very helpful when trying to make friends. It is practice for when you go to college and have to make friends with completely new people. As well as learning to cooperate with others on group projects. Extra activities can also help with concentration on one task, or being able to concentrate on more than one and getting all of the assignments done. Having extracurriulars to attend can be a great way to practice managing your time. Like being able to fit in going to school and having school work into free time and other activities like sports. Participating in sports or an academic club can look good on college applications if you are trying to get a sport scholarship,academic scholarship, or just trying to a good college.

extracurriculars have so many benefits that can help for many years after you participate. They help you exercise your brain and your body, give you new things to learn, and can produce many life skills. Which is why all students should participate in an extracurricular because there are endless benefits to being in these activities.    ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

Your principle has decided that every student has to participate in an extracurricular activity,do you agree/disagree with this decision? I disagree with this decision because in the long run,its taking away many opportunities. Such as,after school jobs,family time,and activities that you enjoy.

After school jobs can be a nessicity. You never know what one is going through,some one might be supporting their family that way. If your always at school,when will you have the time for work? Work and supporting your loved ones should come before and after school project if possible.

I know your family says school first. You also need to find time for your family/friends. Spending time with them,and having fun,is making memories. Its okay to go to school,work really hard,and even though your tired,socialize with them. They love you and your company. so make the most of that.

I know its hard,Going to school,to practice for hours on hours. Then finally going home. Trust me,I do it everyday,sometimes you don't have time for extra credit,let alone extracurricular activities. Us athletes dont get the recionization that we deserve.

26CAE294C16B,"It is idiotic to force all students be in a extracurricular activity. There are over 300 student in most United States middle schools. Many schools do not even have a eleventh of that amount of in clubs and sport teams. Think about how many people would have to be in each club if you wanted each student to be in one. Here are more three reasons we should not force children to be in a extracurricular activity.

Reason one, many students will not have rides home. This is because their parents have jobs. They cannot just leave their job to pick up their child. The children who's parents have job, would not be able to be in a club or sport.

Reason two, student already have things after school they need to do. Children have a lot things they need to do after school, two examples are homework and chores. Many children also already have activity they do after school like playing on a local sports team or dance.

Reason three, most things clubs have are bought by teachers. This is because most clubs are not funded by the school, but by the teacher or teachers that run it. The teachers have to buy the snacks and pay for activities the clubs do. Making every student join a club makes it where the teachers would have to spend more money that they might not have.

Many people would say these are not good reasons. Here are three agruements against why we should not force students to join a extracurricular activity. Agruement one is that students can get rides from other people then their parents. Well this is the same as saying if you want a better job then just get one. You see that does not make sense you just cannot get a better job, just like you can not just get someone to pick up your children. Agruement two is that instead of staying on the sport team a student is already on they should just join the school one. Well schools do not always have the a sport team that the student play or that team might be full. Another reason this argument is awful is that the students have worked hard on to be on the sports team they are on, why should they have to give all that up so they can be on the school's team. Agruement number three is that clubs do not need snacks. This is true, but clubs do need activities, and teachers still have to pay for these.

These were three reasons that we should not force students to be in extracurricular activities. After school clubs and sports are great. Forcing students into them is not. It just does not make sense.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
B082F1A267EE,"We have all heard of extracurricular activities. Many kids do them. There are sports and clubs, a ton of different options. What about the kids who don't do any? What do they do? Should extracurricular activities be required?

Extracurricular activities are a great option. It gives you a chance to be apart of your school. It can be anything from being on your schools basketball team to playing in the chess club. It is a great opportunity to make new friends, to interact with people, and be involved. It makes you feel like you are needed.

In today's world, everyone is on their phones. The second you wake up you check your phone. It has just become part of our daily life, that is why it is so important to spend time off of a screen, to do something you have a passion for. Extracurricular activities gives us a chance to go do something we love, to go outside, to build and create new things, to accomplish something you have been wanting to do. It is really good for out mental and physical health!

Most parents have job and spend most of their day working so they can support their family. When they get home they often have many things to do. They have to make dinner, clean up, and many other things. That is why extracurricular activities are a great option, they are provided by the school. Extracurricular activities are cost efficient and parents do not have to pick/drop of their kids. Most schools provide an after school bus.

6F8081D34E75,"The principal at my school has decided that all students must participate in one or more extracurricular activity the activities include sports, student council, and yearbook. I disagree with my principal's decision and I am going to explain why you should too.

Students should not be forced to have to engage in extracurricular activities because some kids might have trouble with time management. Having to do something else other that school could be very difficult for them. Also parents might not want their child to have to participate in other activities other than school because their child could get distracted.

Another reason of why I disagree with the principals decision is it should not be his or her choice if the child should have to engage in a extracurricular activity that choice should be made by the child or the childs parents only. Some kids can have a illness or disability that is keeping them from doing other things besides school that the principal may not know about.

Forcing students to do some type of activity besides school should not be allowed because what if that child does not have a ride home and the school does not provide transportation. Having to do sports or student council and yearbook along with school could put a load of stress on that child which is never good for a kids mental health. I understand that the principal just wants his or her students to have a healthy life but the choice of if students should be forced to have to participate in an extracurricular activity should not be made by them.

347DE248D051,"Students you should do at least one extracurricular activity! It's very important to do extracurricular activities because you can find out the hidden talents and gifts that you might have. Furthermore, I have done many extracurricular activities in my life to search for what I might be good at and that lead me to swimming! The extracurricular activities I do gave me something to look forward to in life. I agree with the statement that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it's important that they dont just stay at home and do nothing, when they could be doing so much more in their life.

First, extracurricular activities can help expand your options in life. One way extracurricular activities can expand your life options is by helping you make friends. If your shy or have trouble making friends a extracurricular activity can help you because over time you will get closer to your new friends and end up becoming a family. Next, it can help you with collage applications to get into your dream collage because they will be able to see all the things that you have done and achieved from your extracurricular activities. They'll believe you will be able to accomplish many great things. In addition, getting into a collage will help you get the job that you desire. Moreover, the workplace you will choose will have interviews, see your application and also acknowledge the things you have achieved as well to make sure that you are a good candidate and can get the job done.

Second, when you do extracurricular activities you will have something to achieve and accomplish, which will make you feel joyful that you have done something in life. Also, sports or another activity is a very good way to accomplish or achieve something because it can help you look forward into getting better. When you do an extracurricular activity and there is a meet, game or contest for the activity you're doing your family will be there and cheering you on. Furthermore, you will be able to tell your friends or family about this great thing you have done and they will support you and be proud that you have achieved your goal. Which will make you happy and proud of yourself that you've done something. Later in life when your skill from the extracurricular activity comes into play and your the only one that is capable on how to do it you will be able to save the day and you won't regret that you did the activity.

Third, extracurricular activities are something that can help you get away from life. They will be able to let you distress and relax from all the frustration you have going on. As soon as I jump into the pool I let all my worries and things that I'm stressing over about wash away from me and I instantly become more relaxed. Also, as I become more relaxed my attitude and tone gets better and that way I won't say things I don't actually mean. Extracurricular activities can help you take your frustration and stress out into something good like working hard.

In conclusion, I agree with this statement that all students should do one or more extracurricular activities because it's important to stay active and do things. When you do extracurricular activities you'll be able to find out the many gifts or talents you might have. Next, I've done lots of extracurricular activities in my life so far to find the things I'm good at. The extracurricular activities that I am doing give me something to look forward to in life so I can feel like I've done something in my life. Therefore, extracurricular activities are something important you should do and be grateful that you have the opportunity to do it.

Now everybody will have something to do!

The principal just decided that every student must take part in an activity, before school, after school or even during school!

This new, amazing and creative idea will be beneficial to everyone! Not only the students, but the entire school administration including the teachers! Even parents will profit from the outstanding new idea!

""How?"" ""When?"" ""Where?"" you might ask. Well no longer worry! we have all the answers you could ask for.

After this decision starts getting enforced, every student will be able to find something they like!

Possibilities range from participating in sports to serving on the student council or helping to create the school yearbook! Students are very likely to find new friends while they participate in these activities and probably even run into some old ones! Having friends in their activity will surely motivate them to do better and achieve their goal!

Meeting those new people and having that special diversity will bring lots of students together and form unimaginable new bonds, friendships and relationships. Students struggling with their social life and stressing school days will finally have something to look forward to! The sport activities will also greatly improve ones understanding and overall skill in said sport. Joining sports teams will set a positive example for students and be a healthy and rewarding getaway from anything that might be bothering them. Working on the yearbook is an overall exciting experience that involves montages,photo shop and other activities! Students will be able to have fun and help the school at the same time! Student Council is also a splendid decision and it will show a student how many real life companies work, Students will be given more responsibility and trust. Both student council and yearbook editor have much in common and both contribute to help shape a young adults future life by polishing their skills, interests and hobbies. After school parents might still be working or just have too much on their hands to care for their children, This is where these extracurricular activities will also come in handy because students will be supervised, be constructive and have fun at the same time!

Overall these activities would be a great getaway for every student! Activities will include creative and challenging brain usage to athleticism.

91EB3DE61286,"Did you ever thought about doing some of extracurricular activities after school and how they impact you and your community? Well,I agree that students must praticipate in at least one extracurricular activity because it's fun,it helps your community,and you can get service hours.

My first reason is fun. Do you know that feeling when you have nothing to do and then you get bored? Some activities like sport or things that you enjoy to do outside of the school are solution of this problem. If you really enjoy your activity,it will keep you away from being bored. Also,it is a great way to get some skills and improve yourself. On other hand,it is fun because of the other people. Imagine a student that never does activities outside of the school sits at home and does nothing and a student that communicates with many people and meets new people during the activity. I think that the person who has a extracurricular activity has more social skills that will be useful in the future and is never bored.

My second reason is,it helps community. For example,I have an activity outside of the school. It is Russian scouts. We meet up at church in Washington D.C and we talk about how we can help our community and environment. Sometimes we pick up the trash or give away food for homeless and people who needs it. Sometimes we visit old people and help them. Also,we donate some of our collected money for many things. So,I think it's a very good way to help your community by doing kind things like that. Activities like that make a really great impact on you and your community.

My third reason is service hours. All teenagers understand how it is important. For example,if you do extracurricular activity like serve on the student council or like me,be in organization that helps community you can get service hours. They are really important for high school and college. This is why activities like these may help you a lot. I have an expirience of getting eight service hours by helping my Unity time teacher Mrs. Generic_Name with decoration of the Snow Ball dance after school and also I got 6 service hours by helping Russian Scouts with Russian Festival in Washington D.C.

In conclusion,I think extracurricular activities do impact you and your community in a good way. That's why I agree that students must praticipate in at least one extracurricular activity because it's fun,it helps your community,and you can get service hours.

63D663E674C5,"Just over twenty yards from the net with the ball at her feet, the parents and fans rising in expectation, she shoots and she scores! Her teammates gather around her giving fist bumps, high-fives, and cheering for their teammate. In any extracurricular activity, from a sport such as soccer to a school club, students learn important lessons that help them later in life. I believe that students should be required to participate in at least on extracurricular activity because they help build character, teach important life skills, and allows students to explore different opportunities.

The first reason why students should have to participate in extracurricular activities is that it helps build character. Students learn, experience, and grow traits such as responsibility, patients, and selflessness. Sports players have to know when they might not have the best opportunity to score, and be selfless enough to pass the ball to someone who has a better chance of scoring. In extracurricular activities such as Yearbook or Journalism, students have to reach deadlines and be responsible enough to keep up with their work for that class. Extracurricular activities and classes help students become better people and build good character that they might not get without the extracurricular activities offered at their school.

The Second reason is that students learn certain life skills that they can use later, in any career they might go into. Students learn skills such as teamwork while working on projects together, from putting in a group effort to having to depend on each other to finish their own individual parts of the projects on time. Students also learn important people skills, such as talking in front of large groups of people, from doing different activities that you cant just learn from a teacher, parent, or video. A personal example of this is that, while participating in a school club, I had to speak in front of nine classes of around twenty students each. That isn't something that you can read about and then go and speak in front of a large group with confidence and without fear, you have to actually speak in front of those large groups to get over that fear and become comfortable doing while doing it. Without extracurricular activities, I wouldn't be comfortable speaking before large groups of people.

The third and final reason is that extracurricular activities give students a chance to try and experience different things. Having a variety of extracurricular activities, such as multiple sports to choose from, gives the students a chance to find new hobbies as well as likes and dislikes. For example, a student might try basketball and decide she or he doesn't enjoy playing that particular sport, then the following season they could try another sport that they may like instead. In that process they are discovering that they do not enjoy playing one sport and finding other sports or hobbies that they like instead. That helps students, especially when they are getting to their junior or senior year of high school, decide what career they want to go into or what they want to specialize in that they will actually want and enjoy doing.

Extracurricular activities are a major part of school, and I believe it's important that everyone participates in at least one, if not more. Activities, clubs, and teams give students a chance to try new things, find what they enjoy doing, and teach them lessons that they cannot learn anywhere else. Extracurricular activities are important to not only the individual students that are doing them, but everyone else that is positively affected because of those people who took the extra classes or joined a school club.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

Some students enjoy doing activities while some students dont like it at all or some students have not tried doing activities before. Do you think all students have to do actives?

First,Not everyone likes doing actives some students prefer to stay home or go out with family or friends. Students can be very busy by doing homework or projects for classes. Students wont have time to do activities if there busy by doing homework and projects. If they do actives they will get stress and wont be able to spend time with family or friends. Everyone should at least spend time with family. For example,some students dont spend a lot of time with family and if they do activities they wont ever spend quality time with family or wont be able to go out.

Next, Some students might not be into activities. Some students haven't tried doing activities and are scared to do it for example, like sports you can get hurt or break a bone or something. Some students dont like doing activities as much like others do. Some students dont find it entertainment for them and others do and its okay everyone is different. The principal cant make students do something if they dont like it or haven't tried it before in there life.

neccecary. I believe that not all students should be forced to take an extracurricular activity.

Having fun with something you enjoy is a great way to spend your afternoon after school, but some students have loads of homework from honors classes, or they might have a farm to take care of with their parents. Another possiblity is that they have a job at Walmart. They don't have time for a production in theatre or playing this years basketball team. Even if there are a lot of kids who don't have something to do after school, it doesn't make it anymore reasonable to force them into something else to do. They may not have responsibilities, but we do. So why stress us out with more work when you can let us make our own choices.

Being anti-social can be a horrible mix with extracurricular activities since they make us get active with our peers, and that get bad fast. Some kids at this age are in a dark place of the mind, and most of those kids just can't deal with the stress of talking to others. So putting them in a scenario where they have to is not only wrong, but harmful to the student. They could have a mental breakdown, cut themselves, or even go to suicide over little things that people don't even remember. It's an act of terrorism to do any of those things, because it doesn't only hurts the person, it hurts the people around them or close to them. The last thing we want at this school is to make our fellow peers and your students feel stressed and traumatized.

Since we're having to stay after school now, we won't have buses to bring us home, and some of our parents aren't willing to get us either because they're at work or they don't have a way of even getting to us. If we were in highschool then maybe some of us could drive, but we're in middle school. Our parents might both be at work. We don't have public buses so we can't go home that way, and walking home is quite a stretch. We'd probably get complaints for parents about their kids waking home. The best thing you could possibly do is rearrange the bus system, but that's harder than it sounds. It'll all have to be this intricate set of buses, and I don't think you have the time to set that up.

I believe that we should not be forced to take an extracurricular activity. We all have things to do at home, we might possibly not be ready for the exposure, and some of us also don't have a way to get home safely without taking the school bus.

If they participated in an after school activity they would make more friends and it would help them out.

When someone is in an extracurricular activity they work with people who have similar interests.

Therefore, someone in that activity could form relationships with people.

This would help kids form more friendships and make their remaining years at school much more enjoyable.

So, one big impact extracurricular activities have, is giving kids more opportunities to make friends.

Another impact extracurricular activities have is strengthening team building skills and helping kids work well with others.

In most after school activities all of the kids are working towards a common goal.

Whether it be winning a game, publishing a school newspaper, or creating a masterpiece it's always a similar goal.

All the kids work together to accomplish it.

This helps them develop team building skills and allows them to learn about working with all kinds of different people.

For example, if a football team wanted to win their next big game, everyone on the team would have to put in effort and help each other out.

They wouldn't be able to win the game if the defense wasn't protecting the quarterback or if the quarterback wasnt throwing the ball.

So, it teaches kids that they need to help each other out and work together to accomplish things.

Lastly, it should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity because it creates more job and college opportunities for kids.

When colleges are looking at students, they want a kid who can offer more than just a good grade point average.

They want a kid who can work hard and make a difference.

So, they look to see if a kid has participated in an extracurricular.

If the kid has one on their record it will increase their chances of getting excepted.

Jobs look for the same qualities colleges do because it they want a good dependable employee.

Participating in an extracurricular activity increases someones chances of getting accepted at a college or job, so it is in their best interest to join one.

Overall, extracurricular activities help with a lot of things, some of the main ones are creating friendships, building team skills, and creating more job and college opportunities for kids.

There are many more reasons why participating in extracurricular activities are beneficial, but if I named them all it would take hours!

These activities are a good thing for kids, and kids should be required to participate in one every year.

The benefits that come from after school activities are great and very helpful to a lot of kids.          ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
2042CFDC3B39,"In today's world, often times students get carried away with social media, what may seem like never-ending homework assignments, keeping their grades up, and simply the stress of being a teenager in general. The countless things that students have to deal with can get quite overwhelming. Having a way to escape from all of that stress can be quite beneficial for students. I agree with my principal's decision to require that all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it gives students a chance to build relationships with others, it teaches students new skills, and it gives students a creative and/or stress relieving outlet in their hectic lives.

Extracurricular activities give students a chance to build meaningful relationships with others. Often times, students rely on their phones and/or other forms of technology to find sources of entertainment, and thus, deprive themselves of healthy, face-to-face, social interaction. Extracurricular activities give students great opportunities for social interaction and growth that they may not get otherwise. They give students a safe environment that they can go to to make friends, and learn to be a good friend. Though students can often build relationships with peers, they can build relationships with coaches, teachers, and other potential role-models as well . Not only can they befriend these role models, but they can learn valuable lessons from them as well.

Whilst participating in extracurricular activities, students can learn to develop the skills that they currently have, and learn new skills that could aid them in life. Skills such as the ability to be a leader, hard worker, team-player, good friend, and many others is a common thing that students take away from participating in extracurricular activities. For example, students that decide to serve on the student council can learn to develop valuable leadership skills that could potentially help them to be a good leader in an occupation later in life. Not only that, but students may also learn more about themselves and find out that they have certain skills that they did not know about before. While introducing new skills to students, these activities help students develop their previous talents as well by giving them opportunities to improve. Not only do extracurricular activities help improve students' skills, they also improve their mental state.

As previously stated, the lives of students can be quite hectic. When students participate in an extracurricular activity, it provides them with a creative and/or stress-relieving outlet to deal with stress and it gives them valuable life experience. Unfortunately, many teens that get overwhelmed with stress get mental illnesses that can lead them to do unhealthy things. Examples of unhealthy things that teens do when overwhelmed are they could partake of drugs and/or alcohol, harm themselves, or possibly even commit suicide. Extracurricular activities provide students with a safe environment to be themselves and worry less about the stress of daily life. It gives them a break from homework, social media, grades, and other things that could increase the levels of stress in their lives. It also gives students valuable life experience and opportunities to draw upon previous experience. For example; a student could use their knowledge and experience with being captain of their volleyball team to learn to be a good boss.

I agree with my principal's decision to have each student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because extracurricular activities can help students by giving students the chance to build relationships with others and use their social skills, and they can teach students new skills and help them develop their current talents. They also give students valuable life experience as well as an outlet to relieve stress and freely exhibit their creativity. Through the stressful and hectic life of a student, extracurricular activities provide a safe place, valuable skills, friends, life experience, and so much more. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
AE13071BFEF8,"In school, students can participate in a wide range of extracurricular activities like sports, science and everything in between. The principal has made a decision that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, and for good reason. Students can learn many things from these activities, they can improve on social skills and cooperation with one another, and they can engage in a fun experience that will help them grow.

Students can learn many things from extracurricular activities, such as programming or acting. Students are preparing for the world ahead of them, and activities like these enable students to get a head start on their goals for the future. Students also learn valuable life skills from these activities like cooking and sewing.

Students are able to improve their social skills and cooperation with their classmates, not only their learning prowess. Being in a team or in a club of some sort allows students to grow friendships and connections with each other, improve team building skills and expand on communication.

Students, regardless of the activity they choose to be a part of, can engage in a fun and worthwhile experience that will help them grow as people. Students can be a part of something they love and branch out their experiences, try new things and enjoy what they've worked for.

Regardless of students participating in one activity or three, the reward is still the same. Students learn all kinds of things from extracurricular activities, they can branch out to new horizons and grow as people. Students are preparing for the world ahead of them, and extracurricular activities can help them get a head start in the real world even if they are a part of just one thing.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
E8BF036DCFA5,"Students should participate in extracurricular activities

I believe students should participate in extracurricular activities because one it keep them out of trouble, two some of the activities keep them healthy, and three they are fun.

One reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they keep most students out of trouble. For example, it can keep the students occupied so they don't have to be on the streets. Another example is sometimes these activities can help them relax and keep them calm so they stay out of trouble.

Another reason is some of the activities can keep them healthy. For example students can do football or basketball which keeps them running and keeps them in good shape. They can also do lift training after school which keep them fit and all around healthy.

Last but not least these activities are fun. There are always a lot of activities and you can always find something you like. For example if you like sports there are so many different sports you can do. There are also other things like drama club if you like acting, art club if you like drawing, even robotics club if you like technology and stuff like that.

Therefore these are the reasons I agree that all students should do at least one extracurricular activity.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
EC2147043BD8,"Some students love to do extra things in life like sports or things dealing with school like yearbook or student council. But there are cons that needs be brought into light about these extracurricular activities. The principle want his students to achieve in extra activities that they like, but this goal can effect his students in many different ways. Some kids might find extracurricular activities fun while others dont, so the cons about having extra activities are more work, less family time, and very exhausting.

The first problem about these activities are that some students might not get enough sleep. If a student signs up for yearbook or student council then it causes them to stay up for a extended amount of time. Its not healthy for a student to stay up late because when its time for school then they might fall asleep in one of their classes, and they could miss out on important notes and guidelines.

Secondly, extra activities can take away family time. Family time is very important because you might not want to miss out on great things. If a students main focus is on running for student council or any sports they like then family wouldnt be the main concern. Since these students are being told to do these activities it might not affect many others in the same way because not every student wants to sign up for something. A good outcome of a student working on something dealing with a school activity is that there family can be included to help them out.

Finally, The last concern is that students will have extra work. It would be difficult because teachers already give students loads of school work they want to be accomplished. So, since there is lots of work bring given out, extracurricular activities can add lots of stress onto students because they are going to want all their work finished.

Students should be able to do whatever they want because not every student is good at sports or making detailed essays for student council. So, students should be able to choose if they want to be apart in any act of the schools activities because if they are not getting enough sleep, enough family time, and getting extra work then these activities should only be offered to the ones that want to do sports and many other things, instead of making it mandatory. Also, everyone might not want to participate in a extracurricular activity because they might not have what they enjoy to do available.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
D5826C01FBF8,"Kids should be kids and not be forced to do an extracurricular activity. In my opinion kids should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity. Because most kids have homework after school and if they are forced to do an extracurricular activity they have to stay up all night doing homework, therefore they are tired the next day. Plus some kids might not be interested in the extracurricular activityÃÂ´s their school offers so kids are told to do something they are not interested in which can lower their self esteem. Some kids are the last stop of their bus and dont have time to do an extracurricular activity and get their homework done so they have late work or are always tired at school which can make their grades drop from AÃÂ´s and BÃÂ´s to DÃÂ´s and FÃÂ´s.

Kids should be able to chose if they want to do an extracurricular activity or not. Because the families of the students at your school might not want school to be hard for their kid plus some times tradition can get in the way as well. If a student is already stressed out from normal classes they may get to stressed in school leading to them taking others lives or claiming their own life or other bad bad things which is a bad look for your school. Making you and your teachers lose trust and even money. These students and this parents are the only thing standing between teachers and principles from getting fired or losing money.

We come to school almost every day to learn at school and do work at school not to waste time or to do work at home or an extracurricular activity but to become the future of this state, country, and world. We are not slaves we dont come or chose to do stuff like an extracurricular activity because we know we are better stronger and smarter than what some teachers principles and any one else that have a job at a school think I think we dont need it. We are the future and I think more schools need to treat us like we are. I think students should partly have a chose of what they want to learn or have done to the school. Some kids dont siting around at school all day they want to explore and learn first handed but by forcing kids to do an extracurricular activity can take time away from doing that after school. Kids will less likely remember notes or worksheets they did in school and will most likely remember something real they seen or felt.

Some students want to have time at home to do sports or play games or talk to family but an extracurricular activity can take time away from doing that. So in conclusion I do not think we need to be forced to do an extracurricular activity. Because its not fair if we have to but cant on dont want to do it. We dont need to learn more in school we need to learn more out side of school. I think that an extracurricular activity is some thing the student should divide if they want to do it or not. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
EAFFC084F3D3,"I dont agree with the principals decision. For my reason is this. One, we don't have to go if we want to.

Two, we can make our own decisions and not for an adult to make decisions for us. For an example, if a person does something without your permission they're making decisions for you. Although, If that person comes up to you and asks "" hey there is a really cool sale going on hoodies and they want to ship the first hoodie for free."" "" I just want to know if you're okay if I tell them your address."" If you say no you are making a decision not to tell them your address. Same thing goes for school. If an adult starts to tell you something that you do not want to do. Then don't do it and don't listen to them but if it's beneficial to what you have to do by all means do it.

Since our principal made the ""decision""

that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity he or she is basically but not really forcing us to stay after school and do other things than our homework or projects. Since our principal decided we have to do after school activities, there are some kids that play sports outside of school. For an example, if I had to stay after school and do an activity I might miss my football meet this Friday/Saturday. If I don't show up I might miss my chance of showing to the coaches what i'm capable of.

For that incident I might not be able to join an outside football team. There might be some times where you have to listen and do what the person is telling you to do.

Since the principal made the decision to make stay after school to do an extracurricular activity, we might as well do it even though i'm not very fond of people making decisions for me. I can do a few thing until I completely lose interest in a certain subject.. Since it's only one thing we have to do how hard can it be but my answer still stands on me disagreeing with the principal on staying after school and doing an extracurricular activity. There might be some kids thinking "" oh well I need to stay after school so I can get my grades raised"" the only club that might get your grades raised is the homework club and that club is for people that have a lot of homework on their hands. Since that is not considered an extracurricular activity by the principle you might as well stay after school and go to that club either way.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
E3E51C3F6E8B,"Can you imagine being forced to do something that you absolutely hate, well that's what my principal is doing to every student at my school. He's making it a requirement for all students to participate in sports or to work on the yearbook or student council. The students have no other option though, because even though its no fair at all , the teachers and staff dont care what we have to say. So I'm going to change that, but I'll need a little support.

I have to inform the principal what a bad decision this is for the health of all the students attending my school.

If all students were required to participate in a extracurricular activities that they don't want to, then it could lead to depression or suicide. Students have a lot of stress and pressure as it is as a student already, but imagine the students with even more, and that could lead to an increase of the amount of kids with depression and suicides. Some kids might not even be good at the sport they sign up for and and get bullied from the kids who are better at the sport and have more experience than them, and they feel pressured to do better and feel scared to make a mistake.

Therefore kids might feel like they arent good enough and give up, and everyone will think of them as the ""quitter"".

That can cause the kid to feel ashamed and as if he let everyone down on the team and most importantly himself.

Also there would be an increase of injuries if more students were participating in sports. There will most likely be more concussions occurring in the school year due to the danger of sports, and that would be sad if a student was seriously hurt and damage their body and have to live with an injury they got from doing something they really didn't want to even do initially. With all these new teams being made, there is going to be more little friend groups that wont be accepting to all the others. They wont except the fact that people might have interest in something other than what they are interested in and that all the friend groups are equal and that all sports matter equally. When it comes to sports most children become very competitive and feel like they always have to win everything, which is good when it comes to playing the sports with confidence but can get very annoying at school when they act like they are better than all the other students and become bullies to others. These extracurricular activities could also affect the health of the students by them getting overly stressed, over exercising, head injuries , and causing them not to be mentally healthy.

Most students barely get a chance to spend time with their family because of school, and most parents only send their kids to school to get an education but they dont send them there to play sports because that should be the kids decision if they want to participate in something or not. Plus we only have one childhood, so why would we waste it spending time and lots of effort to a extra curricular, that we dont enjoy and is no good for us or for our health, when

I could be at home cooking and baking at home in my lovely kitchen with my beloved family and one day remember as a good memory. Rather than me having a bad memory of a evil principal who forced all the students to participate in a extra curricular that they never wanted to .

The principal should just consider his decision again and think about all of this information and possible effects that can be caused by this decision. Also if he decides to go through with his decision then he should be prepared for the parents who dont agree with the new decision he has applied throughout the school and the angry kids who have injuries and who are mentally unhappy. Some parents might be so unhappy they might transfer their children to other schools.

The school might suffer financially because they would have to buy new things for each sports and uniforms for the students to wear. They would also have to support all the activies by paying for their parties and fieldtrips they go on and also the events they go on that cost alot of money to attend. So this decision ould effect the schools future and he has to keep in mind that we only get one life so why spend our time and effort on something that we are getting forced to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

""I'm sorry Generic_Name, but I have to give you detention,"" said Mrs. Generic_Name. Many students want to complete their homework and earn good grades, but extracurricular activities make it very difficult to successfully finish all the work given in a day. Clubs and sports do help students connect with each other, but sometimes at the cost of thoroughly completed homework. Also, this rule would increase the need of after school bus drivers, if all the kids in our school joined a club, transportation home would be a necessity, and many bus drivers would be busy with elementary schools. I do not agree that the principal should force us to join an extracurricular activity because students will barely have time to see their families, homework and projects will rarely be completed, and students might not have any interests.

Students are forced to wake up early to get on a bus for school and return home at around 4:00 pm, if we had to do extracurricular activities many students who live far away would not be able to get home until very late in the afternoon. When I get home after school I get to see my mom, my sister, and my dog, Scout, but my sister occasionally stays at school to do Mock Trial, a club for future lawyers, when she gets back she is worn out and usually needs to take a nap. With all the effort that goes into school many students do not have time to socialize with friends or even family. The implication of these clubs would, without a doubt, lower the morale of our school by keeping us away from our homes.

With the long hours of school, the seemingly infinite amount of homework, and clubs, some people find it impossible to stay on top of everything. For example, participating in sports clubs forces you to stay after school for hours and ride the activity bus home to do more work from the school. Some believe that it is easy to continually do your work and keep good grades. For instance, my sister is a perfect, yet rare, example of clubs benefiting students. My sister is a courageous, hardworking student who always finishes her work, unfortunately she is not like many students; some students already do not do their work, and with the addition of mandatory clubs, I believe, the grade point average of Generic_School will drop significantly.

Many people like to relax after they finish their work, maybe read a book, watch television, or take a nap; these are all things that are predominately done at home, in the safety of our rooms. Though there are a wide of assortment of clubs at Generic_School, some students, like myself, find that nothing suits them. The choice of having fun or to getting good grades is a very difficult one, sadly, too many students in our school have already picked the former. Many of my friends that have joined clubs, only joined because their friends told them to. Sports teams are by far the most tried out for, but students join them simply to become popular or well liked, not because they have a real interest. This, of course, is not something we can judge, but something that gives us an insight to why students join clubs. Many adults enroll their children in clubs to give them a place to express themselves, but instead clubs assist in the build up stress, anxiety, and in rare cases, depression.

""Ahhh,"" Generic_Name sighed, as he relaxed on his sofa reading his book, as comfortable as he could be. Extracurricular activities are the reason some students are incapable of completing work. In contrast, students who are able to take their time and finish their work are the students who have enough time to correctly and carefully do so. Also, extracurricular clubs create separation between groups, clubs like the gaming club and the football team are on different ends of the extracurricular spectrum, making a social divide between them. In conclusion, I do not believe students should have to participate in any form of extracurricular activity because it will cause them to be distant and antisocial, give them less time to complete work for school, and they might not have any interests in school based clubs.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
DDF590722BF7,"All students should participate in extracurricular activities for many beneficial reasons. They could make a big change in their life an they wouldnt realize it. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps them find a hobby, gives them something to do, and the student would be helpful volunteering.

One of the many reasons students should participate is that they could find a hobby or something they would enjoy doing. Students could find something they like to do and start to participate in the activity more often. Different schools offer different activities so there is a wide range to explore from. They can try out different things and see which one fits them how they like. They could find more than one thing they enjoy doing and decide to participate in all of them. Finding a hobby can happen in different ways, even when you think you wont like something you should still try it out.

Another reason students should participate is that they could have something to do. They wont have to sit at home all day after school. Changing their focus and trying something new could help them fix their grades or behavior if they're struggling with it. Doing an extracurricular activity could introduce you to new things and places, depending on the activity. Different activities such as sports, choir or band classes, and drama classes allow you to travel and spend time doing what you like.

Students would be helpful participating and helping out with activities. They could help the schools come up with different projects or events. Planning school events and projects could be fun, for example; pep rallies, concerts, and fundraisers. With the help of students the school could get a lot done and make a good reputation for their school. When the school needs help thinking of something students could help them accomplish what they need. Younger people can have a wide range of thoughts and any of them could be useful.

In conclusion, participating in a extracurricular activity can benefit the student, their future dreams, and goals. Their grades and behavior could improve well or even better then before, all from participating. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps them find a hobby, gives them something to do, and the student would be helpful volunteering.

DDFE32440B4E,"Should students be forced to do extracurricular activities? I personally believe to do so because the activities can help you in many ways and get you friends. You only have to do at least one activity so you can choose the one that mostly interests you.

First,extracurricular activities can benefit you if you don't have friends or don't have a social life because can help you make a friend in it. You can make friends in these activities for example, Basketball. In Basketball, if your team wins and you guys are happy, your team can talk about things they do after school and share hobbies and interests. If you share theses hobbies, you can get a friend who has the same interests at you. Having a friend in these activities in these classes so you can enjoy it more and not be lonely anymore. Even after the activities and school, you guys can meet up any time at your and their house and be outside and hangaround. Lastly, a friend is important to have, but in a extracurricular activity, it makes it more fun and enjoyable.

Second, some activities can help you in the real world by learning new skills. For example, fashion, sports, and art. For fashion, people can do the activity if they are interested in designing clothes or have a passion for fashion. Basketball can be an area of growth of a person who wants to be good at it, same with other sports. Art can be the most useful thing to learn skills in my opinion because you can learn how to be an artist. People who take art class want to improve at being good and could make a career out of it to make money.

Lastly, I think it's good to force at least one activity to get the benefits, but there are still some cons. People may not be interested because they don't like any of the activities and it can waste time to getting home and less chance to do work. To compare the pros are better because it can change your view on something. In the beginning you would be like ""Soccer is trash"", but afterwards you can be like ""Soccer is fun"" if you gave it a chance.

5DB8A4809D87,"After school activities are enjoyable, but how would you feel if they where required? Soon, staying after school would not be fun anymore. Making students stay after would just make them angry and upset. Students who used to like school might end up despising it. School should be a positive, motivational space, but forcing people to stay after can ruin the environment. After school activities should not be mandatory because of homework, others time, and because students may revolt.

My first reason that after school activities should not be required, is because of homework. Students could struggle to find balance with school work and an extracurricular activity. They might need extra support from a teacher, but may not be able to receive it because of a conflict with their activity. Making students do an after school activity might create an environment where the activities are a higher priority than school work. Students who are already not very good about doing and/or turning in homework might use their activity as an excuse. These students already have bad work habits, and giving them another excuse is only going to reinforce the bad habits. All in all, after school, homework should be a priority, so students shouldn't have to take part in a activity that distracts them from what is important.

My next reason is that after school activities should not be required is because of peoples time. Some students already struggle to find time to have some fun when all they have to do is homework. Adding an activity could make it so they have no time to relax. Students don't have to worry about getting a job or paying the bills. Students should enjoy the freedom they have while they can. Not letting students have the opportunity to use their time positively and productively will negatively impact their view of school. If extracurricular activities are required, students are not the only ones who would be affected. The schools' staff members, such as teachers, would have to stay after to help run the activities. While some teachers might be willing to stay after, other teachers have to go home to help their families or need to use the time to write their lessons. Time is a valuable resource, but controlling how people use it would hurt the learning environment.

My last reason why we shouldn't require after school activities is because people may revolt. Students will be mad if they are required to do the activity, and teachers will be upset if they have to work overtime, but having to stay after school isn't the only reason people would this way. Some people might not enjoy any of the possible after school activities, or the activities they want to do might be full. This will make them not feel obligated to the club or sport they chose. An example is they might pick a sports team, but never show up to practice because they don't care. This is unfair for the students who want to be there, and the teachers who used their time to orginize that practice. Finaly, extracurricular activities happen after the required school hours. Extracurricular activities are extra, so they should be special, not forced.

With homework that has to be done, time that should be used productively, and how students and teachers could negatively react, it is not worth it to force people into mandatory after school activities. Schools should instead make extracurricular activities something people want to be a part of. Students who will be able to use their time as desired will have a more positive outlook on school. If you want to be part of an after school activity, we should be excited to make that choice.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
569400270AD9,"Students should participate in one extra curricular activity because it gives the students a chance to experience something new to experience or gives them an opportunity by following their interests.

For example, if a student has never played a sport before because he did not feel like it, how would the student know that he likes or dislikes the sport.

Students participating in extra curricular activities allows them to explore their interests and something new by themselves.

Allowing them to find their interests on their own allows them to have independence which the students will need in the future.

For example when the students move out of their parents home they will have to find a job on their own and do other things by themselves like paying their taxes.

An example of the benefits and the of the students follow their interests is that they will most likely want to do something great like become a NBA star like Michel Jordan because the parents and people around them let the students follow their dreams. Also will not be forced to do something they dont want to do like work at McDonalds because the parents said what they want their child to do something else instead of letting the students follow their dreams, and intrests.

Giving the students something new to experience could change their mindsets completely.

Changing the students mindsets could change what the students want to do in life or make them strive for their goals.

For example, if the student does a sport that involves everyone to work hard like football, where the coaches make you work hard to do well on the team.

The sport itself makes the anybody work hard that makes the student playing the sport work hard constantly.

If you do something constantly you will create a different mindset for that activity. In this case it would cause the student to have a hard working mindset in whatever he wants to accomplish.

These extra curricular activities are not just giving the students independence, new mindsets,new experiences and letting them follow their interests.

It is also about giving them a chance to change who they are or changing their emotions to what them to be like.

For example if there is a student who's parents just divorced and he is upset and takes his anger out on other students these extra curricular activities could change the student.

If he joins the school soccer team he could get that energy out of him and anger on the soccer team.

He might even make new friends to support him.

This would cause the student to not be as angry and upset because of this extra curricular activity he is participating in.

Overall the students benefit from the extra curricular activities in so many different ways.

Students should always have the option to do extra curricular activities due to how much the students benefit from them.                ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

But students should at least have time to do something else and not be stuck with a screen all the time. People should do something else then be in the house all the time, maybe go do something fun, and hang out with friends then texting them through a screen.

Why students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is to have better communication, be distracted away from an electronic, and to have a better health. Having better communication is good to have because then it's easier for you to start conversations with people that you don't really talk to. Another thing is, you will have more friends, building character in yourself makes you more stronger and having to do something more different and do something extra can help with that. Secondly being distracted from electronics is a good thing because then you have more time to do other things, like to go play outside and play soccer or something. Lastly having a better health is good, being inside all day is not good because you can gain lots of weight by just sitting all day and not do anything.

At the end people should do at least one extracurricular activity because to have better communication, be distracted away from electronics, and to have a better health. It will be better for yourself. Don't go and make yourself look horrible, enjoy life to the fullest, it will help a lot to get friends and start conversations with people. It will help you be a better you. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

It is not a very good idea to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I don't agree with the decision the principal made, because it is an overall problem for students and their families. The principal should not make students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because the students will have too much on their plate, the student will develop negative emotions towards the activity, and it is an inconvenience to the student or their family.

Students already are extremely busy without any extracurricular activities. Students have to complete their homework or study each night, complete any chores that they are given, run any errands that need to be run, etc. These tasks are all a part of the average life of a student without any extracurricular activities they need to commit to. Now, if we throw a sport or a club into the mix, then things get even harder to deal with and even more complicated. Students shouldn't stress about an assignment they didn't have the opportunity to complete because they are a part of something they don't want to be a part of.

Students will come to resent the extracurricular activity they are a part of, just because they are forced to be a part of it. This is the same thing that happens when you are willing to take the trash out on your own, but if your parents yell at you to do it, you won't want to do it. Students enjoy being able to make their own decisions, and take control of what they are doing. If they are forced into something they don't want to do, they will start to put less and less effort into the activity, until they practically dread doing it. Teams or clubs can never be great if none of the participants enjoy being a part of the activity. Overall, the student will suffer, and will resent even the thought of participating in something they don't want to participate in.

All of the pressure that goes into being a part of an extracurricular activity isn't just on the student, it's on their family as well. Students and their families who don't have as much money as others do will struggle to pay for the extracurricular activity that they or their student is participating in. It should be the family's decision whether or not they are spending their money on something that is worth the while. Additionally, students' families who don't have time or opportunity to transport their students to the place where the activity is being held is also a problem. It takes time to drive your student back and forth for an extracurricular activity, and some families just don't have that kind of time.

Some may say that being a part of an extracurricular is good for students' futures, but half of extracurricular activities won't aid students in finding a career. Most extracurricular activities will only teach students what they need to know if they want to be a teacher or sponsor for that same extracurricular activity when it is time for the students to get a job. Extracurricular activities are really for students who have extra time and energy that they are willing to put into the activity. Being a part of an extracurricular is not necessary for your future, and will not guarantee students a career.

The requirement of students participating in at least one extracurricular activity will create dozens of problems for the school and for the families of students. Students should not be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will become overwhelmed, they will come to resent the activity, and their families will be inconvenienced by it. In conclusion, this is not a good decision the principal has made.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
7F375C57B28A,"Do you know that people who have been in an extracurricular tend to get a higher score on the S.A.T.s than people who haven't? I think that extracurricular activities have many benefits for students. I believe that students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can be fun, they can teach students certain skills they would't learn normally in school, and can help students get better a a subject they are lagging behind in.

My first reason students should be required to participate in a extracurricular activity is, they can be fun! This year I decided to play soccer, so I can become more fit. First I thought it was going to be boring, however when I joined the team, I had a blast! I also met Generic_Name and Generic_Name, my new friends! I quickly found my place on the team as defense, I am not too good at shooting into the goals, I do better guarding them. Overall, I believe joining the team was a great idea.

My second reason is that they teach students skills they wouldn't learn taking normal classes. My friend Generic_Name joined the woodworking club and made his girlfriend a wooden heart for Valentines Day, she loved it. Later she surprised him with heart shaped cookies that she made in Good Eats. My other friend Generic_Name wants to make computer games when he's older and joined the coding club. He was about as good at coding as a turtle is at walking, he excelled in that club, and he has a some knowledge that can help him if he still wants to make games in the future.

My final reason is that certain extracurricular activities can help someone get better in a subject they don't do well in. I personally don't have any problems learning subjects like math or science, I actually take honors in both of those classes. If wasn't good at those subjects I would take time after school to join a club like ""Math Club"" where they do pratices and quizes so students can improve. My friend Generic_Name, well he isn't a very big talker and gets nervous when he speaks, so my friends and I wanted him to join theatre. We told him that he would get used talking and step out of his shell, with some effort, he joined the club. Currently he is still working on speaking in big groups, but he is getting better!

In conclusion, making every student partipate in at least one extracurricular activity would be a great idea. It helped me and my friends become better at talking, cooking, woodworking, and soccer. Overall, I think the benefits of adding this new rule overwelm the negatives, they teach students new skills, help them get better at subjects like math and science, and even just give students something that is fun to do after school. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
45E96E189978,"Extracurricular activities are after school activities that students participate in. For example, GEMS,touting,cheer, and yearbook. I believe students should have a choice on whether or not they would like to participate in a after school activity. I dont not agree on the principal making the decision for students on having to join a extracurricular activity, because students may already have enough going on in school as it is, students may not just want to do it, and students may already be participating in another activity out of school.

Me being a student I already know the stress that other students have to go through everyday. Students, like myself, struggle and stress over many subjects and do not want added on stress by having to join a extracurricular activity. For example, I have a really hard time in Math and Spanish, and I try my best in these classes by staying after for help whenever I get a chance, or I always ask a lot of question in class so I can get a better understanding of things. Every time I take a test or a quiz in one of those classes I nearly pass or just fail. By me already having stress over Math and Spanish, joining a club or sport will add on more stress because not only do I have to stay after to get help for Spanish and Math I would also have to stay after for my club or sport and eventually my schedule may end up running into one another.

After a long day of school kids like to go home and relax, eat, watch TV, or just go to sleep and wake up for the next day. In my option theres nothing wrong with wanting to be lazy after a long day of hard work. For example, the whole school day I have been testing and taking quizzes in ever class I have been in, and I just want to go home and and go straight to bed because I am tired from all the work I have been doing all today. Well by me being in a club I would have to stay after and do even more work, and what fun is that. Students do not want to be reminded of more and more doing this and that, we would like to just free of school and not reminded of it all the time.

I feel like athletes have the most stress on them,because not only do they have to do good in school and keep up with there grades,but they also have to be on time for practice, travel from one state to state, and they also miss out on many school events they student enjoy going to. I give them all the praise,because I know its stressful to maintain every thing they have going on. For instance, my friend Generic_Name is plays Softball and she complains to me all the time how she is stressed over how she has to go to practice then come home and do all her homework from the different classes she has. Another example, my friend Generic_Name does Competitive Cheer and tells me all the time how she wishes to attend different events that we have for are school but cant because of practice. Now if these two student had to pick a club to join what time in there schedule would they have to maintain to every thing all at once.

I believe students should have a say on whether or not they would like to join a extracurricular activity , because it is there life. I do not think students should be forced to do something they might not wish to do. I do believe the that the principle should educate us more on the different clubs and sports we have. If it was up to me I would just let students decide on what they wish to do what themselves because making a extracurricular activity a priority for will cause many of them stress which I have prove from my evidence.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
D5724EDF0DBA,"Schools offer a wide range of extracurricular activities for their students. From drama club, to art club, to dance team, there are so many possibilities that schools provide. The principal has decided that every student is required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with the principal's decision because extracurricular activities give students the opportunity to make new friends, relieve stress from school, and discover new interests.

Students may have difficulties making friends, but when they are required to be in a club, they must express their thoughts to sprout inventive ideas. By being in an activity, they are able to meet students that have common interests. Students can share their knowledge and work to build their group. The activities allow them to socialize with their peers by cooperating with each other. Students will work together to create projects and join competitions, leading them to strengthen their bond and have an enjoyable time. They end up having a blast and creating friends they wouldn't have, if not for the extracurricular activity. It also helps students get their mind off stress from school and be calm.

Clubs and teams create chances for students to relax from school. They can focus on the task at hand and not be apprehensive about the homework or projects they may have. Students can rest and enjoy the time they have in the club. There are also extracurricular activities that provide tutoring, which can help improve students' grades drastically. Students get to interact with their peers and make new memories. There is a set amount of time students have for a certain club, so they have a specific block in their day they can use to relax and not be anxious about school. Students are also encouraged to spend time with their friends. It gives them a period of time to hangout with friends they don't see often or new friends they made. Extracurricular activities can also open new interests to activities students would have merely glanced at.

Extracurricular activities provide students with vast teams, clubs, and activities. Students tend to look at an activity, think it seems fun, and then move on with their day. When they are required to choose at least one activity, they can explore the club they thought would be entertaining. For instance, they can try out for the basketball team, and if it doesn't work out, they can move on to the next club they thought would be exciting. This gives students opportunities to discover new hobbies. If a student is already skilled at a subject or sport, they can join a club to work on their skills and excel. They are taught new methods and are able to see varying perspectives from other peers. This new way of thinking leads students to make noticeable improvements, and they expand their knowledge on the subject or sport.

There are numerous activities the school provides for students to make their school experience memorable. Activities are beneficial and allow students to meet new people, relax from school, and open their mind to new interests and perspectives. The prinicipal's decision for students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is a superb decision that will lead students to have a great school year.                              ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
FCEF76504A79,"""Hey Generic_Name! Do you want to join the Dance team?"" Said Generic_Name. ""Oh I'm planning not joining anything."" replied Generic_Name. ""But the principal said all students must join a activity! If you don't join any of the activities than your most likely going to get in trouble."" said Generic_Name. ""Oh, I didn't know that! But that is not a good idea because what if no one don't wanna join any of the activities?"" replied Generic_Name. ""Maybe your right, I kind of don't wanna join any of those activities. Maybe we can tell the principal!"" said Generic_Name. ""Yeah! We can convince him that not every student should join a activity."" replied Generic_Name. So Generic_Name and Generic_Name went to the principal's office to convince him that not everyone should join a activity.

I disagree that all students participate of joining a activity because maybe no one is interesting of any of those activities, maybe its too much to do at school, and s ome students maybe don't like any of those activities .

Maybe no one is interesting of any of those activities.

First, I think probably no one is interesting in any of those activities cause what if some students don't like sports or stuff at school. For example, my sister don't wanna be any of those activities because she says its boring. Also, some students can't do any of those activities cause maybe they have disabilities or they just don't like it. For example, my best friend can't walk because she broken her legs a lot from doing a sport and she doesn't want to do anything activities. Next, there are some kids at school who are too lazy to do anything but they can join anything else but sports. For example, my dad wants me to play football but I want to do something else. In conclusion, you don't have to any of these activities because maybe its not the best for you.

Probably too much for some students.

First, some students maybe have some important things at home with his or her's parents. For example, some students can have choirs to do at home or babysit his or her's siblings. Also, they could be very tired if they have a long test or didn't have enough sleep to do sports or any activity. For example, I always get tests almost everyday cause my teacher loves giving us quizzes and sometimes I don't go after school activities. Next, some activities can put too much pressure on a student because maybe he or she can't play that good. For example, students can't do everything in life good but they don't have time to do these sports or another stuff. In conclusion, students don't have to do these things cause maybe they have to do something else that is important to his or her's activities.

Some students maybe don't like any of those activities.

First, some students don't even like sports or any school doings because its probably boring or scared getting hurt or get in trouble. For example, my friends don't like school and they don't wanna to any clubs, sports, or even play outside. Also, some students can be really scared of trying something new at school. For example, I don't wanna be in Book club but maybe it can be fun and try to improve reading! Next, students can be forced by joining a activity by his or her's parents. For example, my mom wanted me to be on the Track team because she says I'm good at it. In conclusion, students don't have to this because they probably don't like it.

"" Oh my gosh! I can't believe the principal change his mind about joining a extracurricular activities!"" said Generic_Name. ""Yeah! So that means you don't have to join anything."" replied Generic_Name. ""Yeah, Im so happy too! But I'll join the Dance team with you if you like."" replied Generic_Name. ""Awww thanks bestie! Now lets go to lunch, Im so hungry."" said Generic_Name. ""Okay lets go!"" replied Generic_Name.

542161D0012C,"I feel like extracurricular activities should be a choice. Students shouln't be forced to do one. School activities should be fun and we should do it because we choose to not because the principal feels like we should. We shoudl do it because we feel comfortable with what we chose an if we didnt have an extracurricular before we might've had a good reason. For example alot of people play basketball. They also have reason as to why they play it. Sudents thats play it are most likely playing it because they feel they're in the comfort zone when they play. Students shoudln't have to do extracurricular activities if they dont feel right or comfortable do it. It's obvious that it's unfair especially if they have other things to worry about ousitde of school.

As explained in the first paraghraph, being forced to do something you dont want to do isn't fair and its frustrating. It's different if your mom is telling you to clean up or wash the dishes but if you have to do some that you really dont have to do and the principal is making you because he just wants you too then thats unfair. If your not already involved in an extra activity then apparently you dont want to do. Which is why he should not make you participate. The need to let you keep doing what your doing.

Extracurricular activities can be alot if you have other things to do as well. For example; if you have to stay bad for a certain activity but , you also have to stay back for a certain grade or class and you cant do both then your going to have to chose which one to go to and the grade will seem more important but you still might need to work on something for your extra activity. If you dont stay back for the activity then you'll have more time to get up your grade in this certain class. Instead of worrying about multi-tasking you wont have to. Now if you can make time then that's great and you could include yourself into an extracurricular activity if you need or want extra credit. You could also just do it for fun because thats what it's for!

Another reason for why I disagree with this statement is because of time. Alot of people tryout for certain things and never end up pulling through because of their time and the other things they have to do. Students spend alot of time between sports, chores, and school including homework . Espacially middle school with our extra classes. The majority of students have little siblings that they might need to pick up after school and walk home. Even besides my extra scenarios time is important anyway. It would even be fun if they made us pick an extra activity especially if we didn't want to.

In conclusion, I disagree with the principal and feel like he should not make us chose an extracurricular activity. it wouldn't be fair nor fun and alot of students wouldn't enjoy it. Students barely participate in them anyway and nine times out of ten they have a good reason why . Forcing it doesn't make sense. however thats just my opinion. Other people might think differently.                            ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
3B4C23859101,"The idea of extracurricular activities is very questionable by some schools. There is a big question of whether or not they should be required. I think that extracurricular activities should be required because they help develop time management, improve social skills, and help students know their interests.

Some students in today's world don't know how to manage their time. In my history class most of the kids never get their work done because they don't know how to manage their time. They end up having 15+ assignments late. I know that one of the many things that employers look for in an employee is if they can manage time. If they can't manage their time in history class I don't know how they're going to get a job. Extracurricular activities will help with time management because they will force a student to budget their time on different activities. They will have to choose when to practice or how much time goes towards each assignment.

Extracurricular activities will help with social skills. Students will be forced to communicate with other people. In the real world, employers want an employee that knows how to communicate with coworkers and customers. Extracurricular activities will help the student talk to other people their age and meet new people. It will help some students not be nervous to talk to other people.

Students will discover their interests when they do extracurricular activities. When students are about to graduate high school most of them don't know what they want to do. The main cause of this is they don't know what they enjoy doing out side of school. These students just focus on school work, when really colleges don't only look at the test scores, they also look at extracurricular activities. My grandmother went to college and she graduated with a degree in cartography(map making). She never used that degree for the rest of her life, it was a quick decision that she did not think about. Later in her life she went back to school to become a nurse. She decided she wanted to be a nurse when she really thought about her interests. It is so important for everyone to think about interests. Extracurricular activities can help determine a person's future career.

Extracurricular activities allow students to learn time management, improve their social skills, and learn their interests. These are the important because they are necessary for succeeding in life, in school, and in jobs. Extracurricular activities have overall positive affects on students.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
4AB030046F42,"What do you do on your free time? Many students are involved in extracurricular activities such as sports, working on school yearbooks, or helping out as the student council. I think extracurricular activities is something that students should participate in because it would help students to balance their time, they would aslo stay active, and it can help students to get into collage.

One reason why I think students should participate in extracurricular activity is because they would learn to balance their time. With school work, family plains, and extracurricular activities in mind students are forced to balance them all. For example, when I was in elementary school I didn't have to worry about balancing my time because I didn't have much going on. Now that I'm in middle school with a lot on my plate, I have to make a schedule to balance things out. With extracurricular activities it would help students to practice balancing their time now, so that it would be easier as they get older.

The next reason why students should involve themselves in extracurricular activities is because it would keep them active. When students have a lot of time in their hands they tend to feel bored, so they procrastinate. For example, when my friends and I have a lot of time we tend to not use it productively, but wast it instead. This causes us to loose track of time. So by participating in extracurricular activities, students would be busy.

The last reason why I think extracurricular activity is something students should be involved in is because it would help them to get into college. Now a-days colleges not only look at grades when accepting students, but they also look at activities they did outside of school. With extracurricular activities on their college application, students are more likely to get accepted to a college compared to when they don't. For instance, a boy who graduated at the top of his class applied for his dream college. On the other hand, a girl who was also at the top of her class was applying for the same college. The college looked at both students' college applications and accepted the girl. The school accepted the girl because she was able to keep her grades up while participating in extracurricular activities.

In conclusion, I think students should participate in extracurricular activity because it would help them to balance their time, it would keep them active, and it would help them to get into college. Although, some people would disagree for reasons such as it would be too much things to think about, or that it would be tiring I still strongly encourage them to at least try one extracurricular activity.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

It will help students develop relationships. It will improve overall daily life for students. It will also give the students an opportunity to practice useful life skills.

Making students participate in an extracurricular activity will help allow the students to build relationships. Through the extracurricular school activity, students would have a new way to meet people. Through the club or sport the students would also have built in time to spend with these people to make meaningful connections. Meeting people this way would also not carry nearly as much social anxiety because students would already have a common interest.

These mandatory extracurricular school activities will also help to improve the daily life of students. The club or sport that the student chooses to participate in would provide something to look forward to after school. These activities would provide a light at the end of the tunnel for students. These activities would also positively impact student's daily lives because they would get to participate in an activity they enjoy on a regular basis. A sense of community would also be built between students who participate in the club. Overall all of those things would improve student's mental health and lives.

These extracurricular clubs and sports would also give students an opportunity to practice important life skills. These activities would give students a chance to practice working together. The extracurricular clubs and sports would also give students a platform where they could practice and improve their leadership skill. Because other students would be in the extracurricular activities it would also give students an outlet to practice general social skills. All of these skills will be incredibly useful and important to the students going forward in their lives.

As you can see, mandatory extracurricular activities in schools would greatly benefit students. These activities would give students an opportunity to build relationships.

F78B66358F6F,"School is a place where you learn about many topics. Having an extracurricular activity after school is very important. They can benefit you in many ways. There are many types of extra activities. Your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Extracurricular activities are very important, because they give you a chance to learn about a broader variety of topics. In high school, most activities will give you one credit towards your degree. This is important because your degree is what decides weather or not you can get a good job. After school classes can also be fun. If one is doing an interesting activity after school, that could be fun and it can be something one can look forward too. Depending on the school, there will be a wide variety of extra things to do after your day is over. With that being said, there must be something that is fun or interesting.

Most students will blow off after school activities because they know that they don't need to engage in them. If students must participate, than they would not be able to ignore them. Now even though this would not be every day, it would still be very beneficial to do extracurricular activities. Some students do multiple after school classes a week, but this can be stressful at times. That is why one activity is enough to start.

I would agree with him,because I think after school activities are beneficial. They benefit students because they can find new passions or hobbies and it can help students do better in school.

To start off it can help students find new passions or hobbies. Some do not have a passion or something they want to be better at. So extracurricular activities like sports,writing,gaming,etc can help them find a passion. Also extracurricular activities can help shape your dream job or something you want to be when you grow up. As a kid you always want to have a dream job or something you want to be when you grow up so you know what choices to and schools to choose to get to or qualify for that job. Certain groups after school can be beneficial in the future also. Some groups can go on you resume and can get you a certain job or get you into a school. Students always need a hobby or passion so they can stay challenged and distracted.

After school activities can help kids do better in school. Extracurricular activities can help your grades. There are book clubs and homework clubs that you can participate in to get a better understanding of a subject. You can also find new friends .Students can find people that have the same interest as them. Students that play sports also do good in school. When students play sports they tend to do better in school and completing their homework that when they are not active. After school activities benefit grades positively and students.

But some people will probably say that kids need freedom and should not be forced to do extracurricular activity. But kids with to much freedom get lazy and distracted. Students can easily get distracted by the television,video game,or phone so much that they will forget about homework or submitting that paper in and end up having failing grades. Students then sit in the house all day and do not do anything productive. And sitting around in the house all day is bad for your health. Students having free time is not a very good thing and can positive and negative at the same time.

Also if students wants to stay in shape they could participate in a sport that they like want to try out for once. For example they could play soccer, football, basketball, ultimate Frisbee. Plus if students don't want to do any sports they could cheer the sports team if they have a game. Or there are many other options to do.

If students does not like the activity they could go with a teacher or a club that discover new information that could help them in the future. For example if they went to a club that talks about robotics,math, or science they could use that if they would get that job. Also it could help them in college if they wanted to take this path this could help them already have an idea of the information. That could help the students get a great job when they are older. which would help them if they were growing up in a low income family.

Plus if the student is already in a team,and they want to get better they could practice in the sport if the school allows the sport to be played. Also if they had a friend, or someone that plays the same sport they play they could practice together and benefit from it. By making a new friend or by practice with a new way of looking, And it could help the student or students get ready for the school try out. By having everyone do a extracurricular activity it would help people with a problem with they lives, like with overweight or problems at home it would give a way to have a bright future in the end. even if the student comes from a good background it will still benefit them.

Finally I truly agree that everyone should do a extracurricular activity to help them with making new friends or even getting better at a sport,or just practicing their sport it will help them in many ways that they don't even know yet.      ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
6787D1982CEE,"I donÃÂ´t eat lunch at school and I donÃÂ´t pack my lunch. I disagree because we are in school for a long time,spend time with family, and after school responseibility.

First, we are in school for a long. Our schechedule says we get to school 7:00 and we get out of school at 2:30. Students get bored after a while and play games on their computer. Students donÃÂ´t like the schools lunch and some donÃÂ´t pack lunch.

Second, spend time with their family. Your family might have a fishing competion to see who caught the most fish and the biggest one. You might play board games with your family like Uno,Checkers,and Twister. You might play video games with your family like Family Feud,Mario Kart 8,and Rocket League.

Final,after school responseibility. You might help your grandpa work on the car, or help your grandma with cooking. You might have to do chores like washing the dishes, do laudry, and fixing your bed. You might have a dog in a crate, or you might have to feed them and give them water.

In conculison, you might have chores to do, get bored in school,and might not see your mom or dad until saturday and sunday. Do you agree or disagree with my opinion ?",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
90FD792769FF,"Why I agree we should have extracurricular activities at our school

Robotics, SCA, year book, cooking club, ceramics? Do any of these peek your interest? If so, then maybe a extracurricular activity is for you. There is a broad selection of clubs, teams ,and groups you could pick from to be a part of. Being involved in an extracurricular activity could be good for all of us in many ways, but there are 3 main reasons why I agree with having them in our school. The first way is you can make new friends, that one go to your school ,and two like the same things as you. The Second way is you can be introduced to something you haven't heard of, and could end up finding a liking for it. Finally, for some students it will keep them entertained when school is over with ,and they dont have anything to do after school. Finding something 1 you like, 2 you can do with your friends, and 3 is right at your school with no need for transportation, is a great thing every student should be able to have.

Making new friends with similar interest

Making friends in middle school let alone any school is sometimes a tough thing to do. Many people struggle with finding things that connect them and there friends. After all that is what make a lot of friendships happen, the liking of something similar. So what better way to find friends then doing something you like after school, with at first maybe people you dont know, but have the same liking as you, to then being a friend with the same liking as you. I know even sometimes kids that aren't shy have a hard time making friends. Maybe thats because they dont know where to start other than,hi my name is ... i am .... i have ... my favorite... and so on. That kind of conversation can't go on forever, but if they have something to already talk about like basketball for example, you can go right off those starter sentences right into a real discussion. In middle school making connections and making friends is just the start of what we are going to be doing it for the rest of our lives, so why not become good at it now.

Finding something new

Many students play sports outside of school like basketball,soccer,football, and more, but i'm sure most of them are good at more than just one thing. Thats where extracurricular activities can play a role. This gives students a chance to experiment and try new things that they think they might enjoy. If someone is a really good leader on the court or field, always cheering on a teammate or helping them out,then maybe they could do that for our school in the SCA. You don't even have to be good at something to try it out, extracurricular activities is a place to have fun learn new things and try new things. You never know if you will like it till you try it. The school offers many different activities and if you dont seem to find one you like there is always the option to start you own club. All you need to do is get a group of friends ( five or more) and a teacher to sponsor it. Being part of a team group or club can be good for anyone,and everyone, even if you already have a team, another cant hurt. So maybe this year try something new, be part of a different team, find a new group, or bring some good ideas too a new club.

Entertainment after school

Think about it. What do you do after school? I'm sure a lot of you said I play video games,or I go on my phone,or I relax, and I'm sure there is a point when your like I'm so board. Well I have your answer. Extracurricular activity! Yep thats right,extracurricular activity is right after school so that means you dont need to be driven to the school after you already left, you can just stay for a fun filled time with others. This can be very good for a lot of kids in many ways, because sometimes when students go home they stay on there electronics/ devices all the way till they have to go to bed! Sometimes even without a break. Thats no way to spend a day when you have a great alternet like extracurricular activity time. The best part is when you get home after your extracurricular activity and your parents tell you to do your homework ,or do some chores ,you can just say well I just got home from school and need some time to relax. This is also good for kids that just go home and hop on there devices/electronics,because there is not any real social aspect to that,no real human interaction which everyone needs. So try it our sometime, it can't hurt and maybe you will even really enjoy it.

Having a chance to making new friends with similar interest ,Find something new, and having after school entertainment is a very good thing that other schools should try for there students. Because it gives kids with no opportunity, opportunity, kids that need new friends, a chance to make new friends,and people who dont have anything to do after school something to do after school. There are also so many things and activities to choose from you couldn't go wrong with any decision you make. This is why I agree with having after school extracurricular activities and I hope you do too.             ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
F08DE35EFE16,"My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least onew school activity. I dissagree because mabye people just dont want to do an school activity it would be unfair for the people who don't want to do a school activity will the get a concequence what happens to the people who does not want to participate.

I think it's a bad idea because some people just get tired of school all day long. Some kids might be shy because they are telling themselves they can't do it so then they just dont participate. Sometime kids get tired of thinking all day and just want to go home because they be so tired o school. If it helped you leard and not just do things for fun mabye it would be a good idea but no it just fun and games sports will not help you count money math will so instaid of sports they need to have an after school program for real school.

I dissagree because when I get home from school I be tired of school i dont want to stay back and play sports or serve on the school council. School is a place of learning not just that it helps you in life and it teaches you life lessons and not only that it puts knowlage in your brain about your bast your future and how to count 123 or say ABC that is school no some play house. I like school just the way it is with student in class learning it might be boring but it will help you in the future.

That is why i dissagree because what is going to happen if you don't participate nobody wants to get punished for somthing they dont want to do so i dissagree with the principal because it's not right on the kids who don't want to participate in that activity.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
1B95C44855DD,"Forcing students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is an unnecessary decision. In my opinion, I believe that you should only join an activity if you want to. I also believe that extracurricular activities are meant to be completely optional. You shouldn't be forced to do something that you have no interest in doing. Some of the activities may not interest students at all and we want them to have fun, not be extremely bored because they were forced to join an activity. I disagree with the decision to force all students to participate in at least one of the activities because some students don't want to join one, others might not be able to join, and some have things to do outside of school.

First, some students don't want to participate at all. I wouldn't make them have to do something they have no interest in doing at all. For example, some could care less about playing a sport. They could also probably not care at all about joining a club, or to work on the school yearbook.

Next, some students might not be able to participate in an activity. They could be busy with something. They might not have the time to join one or some of the activities. That is the second reason why I disagree with my principal's decision to enforce students to participate in at least one activity.

Lastly, some students have things to do outside of school. They might not be able to stay back after school for one of the activities. Things like having to watch and take care of your sibling, having to go somewhere are some examples of why students wouldn't have the time to participate. They wouldn't be able to focus on things like sports, clubs, etc.

Now some may disagree and say that it's a good idea to make students join an activity but there are some pros and cons. Sure students would be learning more things but I believe that half the people there would be the ones who were forced to join in the first place. There are some benefits to being in an extracurricular activity but i don't think it should be enforced.

That is why I disagree with my principal's decision. Activities shouldn't be mandatory but just an option if you want to try something new out. I hope Generic_Name revokes this decision so we're not forced into something we don't want to do. In conclusion, I don't agree with Generic_Name's decision because some students don't want to join one, aren't able to participate, and some have things to do after and outside of school.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
C3AE86A7A222,"There is way to forget all of the school work and do something a lot more funnier during the day its called doing an extracurricular. For example, you had a very boring day in all of your class's ,and having that extracurricular like a sport could set you in a different mood. I strongly agree having an extracurricular is a good idea for the students. It's a good use of free time away from the school work, future careers ,and it would be fun for the students.

An extracurricular is a great way to get away from school stress. There are some days students have to do nothing but sit down and write for the whole day. Research says that doing this same cycle everyday will not help students intake information the right way. Having this extracurricular is also a lot like having your brain rest to better process that information.

A extracurricular would be great for students looking for more experience for future careers. like joining the student council or doing a sport. For example joining the students council is like taking ownership of a job ,and doing a sport like football, soccer and wrestling start to get young athletes to get a lot better. An extracurricular can be very helpful in the long run.

Having a extracurricular would be a lot of fun for students picking what they wanna do. Like some students that have a heart for sports or if other students want more of a challenge joining the student council may be fun for them. Research says that when your're a lot more happy you are more awake and ready to learn. If all the students did an extra curricular it would for a fact brighten their moods.

In conclusion, having a extracurricular is a good idea for the students. It's fun and it would get more students to wanna do it. Its a good use for free time and to take a break from school work. Helps out a lot of students for the real world. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
90A986A7470B,"Not every student has the time for extracurricular activity classes. If the principle dose decides to have students do extracurricular activity classes then it should not be counted as a grade. I think this because most students have other classes, grades, and homework to worry about. If the principal require a extracurricular activity classes then students might become stressed.

First, students already have a choice in which related art class they want to take. Even though it is a choice it is still marked as a grade. Related art classes is like a break from class. If the principal requires you extracurricular activity classes then thats taking time from students learning.

Second, feel like students would not have enough learning time in school if extracurricular activity classes gets added to our school hours. Then it might be too much pressure on students and that can effects a students learning. Teachers need time to teach and students need the time to process what they are learning. Some students need more class time to do work therefore extracurricular activity classes might not be the best choice.

Lastly, some students might not be interested in taking extracurricular activity classes. Students might not be interested because they might not have the time for it. Most students will not try in something they are not interested in and some students are not interested. If teachers count this class as a grade then grades might go down because how many classes is taken in a day.

In conclusion, I think all students should have a choice to take extracurricular activityclasses. Not all students have the time or interest to take the class. Will you make your students take this class if you were a principle. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
7181D43663A6,"There are innumerable extracurricular opportunities for students to participate in at their school. Most schools offer a broad range of activities, which is why I agree that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity at their school. No matter what the activity is, it can be good for the mind and the body. Therefore, students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will give the students a chance to try things that they normally wouldn't, it will provide students with more opportunities to make friends, and it will better serve them in the long run.

Requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity will give them a chance to try things that they normally would not. Most people tend to stay in their comfort zone, but this rule will challenge them to try new things that they will hopefully enjoy. For example, someone that never reads might never join their school's book club, but with this rule they could join the book club and discover that they love reading. Overall, trying new things is essential to finding new interests.

This rule would also be very beneficial to the students because it would provide them with more opportunities to make friends. Some students have a hard time talking to new people, so this rule would require them to join a team or club and talk to the people also on that team or in that club. This would be great for both the students joining the extracurricular activity, and the people already participating in the activity. Lastly, all of the students involved would have an equal opportunity to meet new people and become friends.

Finally, requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is a good rule because it will better serve them in the long run. Extracurricular activities can teach the students new skills that can become very useful to them in the future. Colleges also take extracurricular activities into account when they are reviewing applications. The most outlandish skills can become useful at any time, so it is important for students to learn about whatever interests them, because they never know when they will need those skills. To conclude, participating in at least one extracurricular activity will be more helpful to students in the future.

Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will give them an opportunity to try new things, make new friends, and it will be better for them in the future. If schools had this rule, then more students would enjoy going to school, and they would become more involved in the school. Once people are out of their comfort zone, then they will discover new interests that they never knew they had. Overall, this rule would help many students come out of their comfort zones and become more confident people. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
