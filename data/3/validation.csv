So therefore i think we should keep the electoral college.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the Electoral College. Also we help choose our states electors when we vote for president, but if we did'nt have an electoral college there would'nt be any reason to have a president or government.

But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee (

and that trust is rarely betrayed

), what they mean by that is that if he or she were to become president they could not lie or betray anyone.

The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast. I think they should really make people vote because its not fair or equal if only half of us americans voted.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates as we saw in [

2012's

] election-to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states. which means almost everyone voted that year.

The electoral college method helps see who the right person is to help our country. Therefore they need to keep the electoral college for us to see where it will take us all through the years and for us to acknowledge how it has helped americans all around the world to get where they are today.

There has been much controversy over whether or not we should keep the Electoral College or have it removed and vote on the president based on popular vote.  I believe the best decision is to change to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States.  If the system would change, people would feel like their votes actually matter more then they do now.  They wouldn't have to worry about the electors flipping sides. Some people though, do say that the way the election is now is completely fair in the case of votes are based on population.

To begin with, if the Electoral College was to be taken out of use, more people would feel like their vote matters.  Although you may think you are voting for your choice of president, you are not.  As of now, when you cast your vote, you are actually just voting for your candidate's electors, as said in ""What Is the Electoral College"".  In the 2000 campaign, voters in seventeen states didn't have a chance to see the candidates at all.  Those candidates went mainly to the ""swing"" states, or states that were not certain on who they would be voting for.  The states unvisited, such as Rhode Island and South Carolina, were passed over because the candidates knew they would or wouldn't have their vote no matter what.  The ones who questioned their vote did not have the chance to see either candidate in their state.  In, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", the Romney and Obama election is mentioned.  It brings up the fact that Romney knew that throughout the South, he was going to get their vote.  He realized that there was no need to go there because he didn't need anymore popularity in the South because he had already gained their electoral votes.  Those who opposed Romney in the southern states felt that their votes would not matter because majority already knew they were voting for Romney.  If the system were to change, which I believe it should, more people would feel their votes mattered no matter what state they were in.

In addition to feeling like your vote matters, people never know if the electors would flip their desicions.  The slate of electors is not picked by the people.  It is said in, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid jdefenses of the system are wrong"", that sometimes the state conventions, the party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves choose who will be their electors.  That being said, you don't know whether or not the electors will follow your choice of president or not.  For example, in 1960, some electors refused to vote for their party's candidate and they chose whomever they wanted. If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen.  A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now.  This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes.  You can see that the current system has its flaws.

Many people say that it is fair for all states because of their amount of electoral votes.  For example, in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", Florida, which has a much larger population than Wyoming, recieved 29 electoral votes for Obama while Wyoming only had 3 electoral votes.  This, at the same time though, makes candidates want to only go to the larger states to try to get their votes.  The smaller states once again feel left out and unappreciated.

In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote.  Above all, it is more fair to the people.  Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now.  People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for.  Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College.  I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College.  All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree.

I feel that you should keep the Electoral College. They help vote to decide the President as well as the Vice President. ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President .""

Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. Lots of states have a ""winner-take-all"" system. This system awards every elector to the winning presidential candidate. People would say that the Electoral College should be gone, they would say it is a disaster factor. ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse."" This was very bad, but nothing has been worse which shows that the Electoral College has been in control. Also after the elections the governor gives out a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" this shows which electors will represent your state. So Mr. State Senator I hope that you dont get rid of the Electoral College.

Have you ever sent your vote to where its is in the hands of other people not knowing what is going to happen to it like is it going to be counted for the person you want it to, or it could be for the person you really do not want to win. Well that is called an electoral college. It in my opinion is not a very good system because, you don't always get to vote for who you want to.

I believe that we as individuals have the right to choose what we want in a leader. I do not believe Electoral College. For the simple fact, we do not always get to vote for who we want to run our country. The people of America have their own beliefs and own opinion and when it comes down to where we have to choose the person who will be running our country for four consecutive years we will vote for the one we believe that will not hurt our beautiful country. But if we did choose the Electoral College and I wanted to vote for John McCain for instance, and is sent it in and now your vote is in the hands of other people now you don't know if your vote is gonna be for John McCain or Barak Obama. Therefore I do not like or consider anyone using the Electoral Collage.

By using the popular vote you are guaranteed the vote you wanted. You don't have to worry if you vote got changed or not. You popular vote is what you wanted to choose and no one could change that

So I think I speak for the people when I say lets do away with the Electoral College and just use the popular votes.

E36541D9BAE8,"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is not a good thing. The people should be able to determine who their president is. Not the stupid electors. It's called the people's nation for a reason. Majority rules. So whenever we have an election, which ever president gets more votes from the citizens of the United States of America, should become the president. Say if two people were running for president and one got more electoral votes and one got more citizen votes. The one with the more electoral votes would automatically win! Now, isn't this unfair? The people's voice needs to be heard and reconized!

According to source 2, the electoral college electors defy the will of the people. I don't disagree one bit that this is undoubtfully true. Millions of people live in the United States. Only 538 people are in the electoral college. We leave the hope of our nation into the hands of 538 people. What if one of the electors is crazy? What if they mess up on their ballot on accident? It's all up to them! We need to make sure that our voices are heard in the next election!

Some people think that the the electoral college is good because the electors know what they are doing. Well I say they don't! Millions of people do know what they are doing though and that's the very upmost important asspect of this whole essay.

Why are you reading this you may ask? Beacuse you have a voice that needs to be heard! We want our votes to count for something in our bleepin lives! Let's do this! Yeah! FOR THE PEOPLE!!            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The popularity vote is not having much of effect as the electoral college, the ellector college is also a non-democratic metod of the choosing of a president. these cause the election to be kind of fixed.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors A larger amount of 270 electoral votes is ruled to elect the president. According to a gallup pollin 2000 Al Gore won the popularity vote but lost the presidency because of the electoral college. More then 60 percent of the voters choose a direct election to the kind we have. The electoral colege has a large advantage over the popularty vote.

The non- democratic way of choosing a president tha should be changed by the candiate that gets the highest popularty vote the winner of the election. It is not democratic because the electors who elect the president, and not the people. It is as if that when you vote for a candidate you're voting for slate electors. it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.

The popular vote also has a down side to it the votes coould choose a president fo the wrong reasons. This could cause a disaster and be a very bad thing for the American people. The electoral college pays very close attention to that a looks at both candiates reasons of there decsions. In 1960 , segregationists in Louisana legislature nerly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with diffrent elecotors thta would oppose John F. Kennedy.

3C1F9041C565,"Should our way of voting in the United States be changed? The way we vote today is through the electoral college. Each president get a certain number of electoral votes and that is how we vote on specific leaders. The Electoral College process was established in our Constitution as a compromise. This way we could elect our president by a vote in Congress and election of our president by citizens who qualify. Is it not time for a change in the Electoral College?

First off, the Electoral College is a specified process. This process consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is manditory to elect the President. The way this works is every state has a certain number of electoral votes, mostly due to population. For example, a larger state with a large population will have more electoral votes than a smaller state. Also, each candidate running for president in your state has their own group of elector. These electors are chosen based opon the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. There is a presidential electon held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of the month of November. When you vote, you are helping choose your state's electors. When you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candiate's elecotrs. After your presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" showing all the candidates who ran for President in your state and with the names of their respective electors. This also shows which electors will be representing your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.

In addition, the pocess of the Electoral College should be changed. The are even a number of Presidents that tried to abolish the Electoral College. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, adn the AFL-CIO all agreed on abolishing it. It is proven that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Most voters today are significantly uninformed. Some do not even know what or whom they are voting for. Some of these people are not even U.S. citizens. Yes, some states do require to so identification, although others do not. A direct election would be more specified and easier for people to choose and use. Some people overlook these detail while others enjoy the system because of the power it provides them. There are multiple errors in the voting process. There are certain people that do not even posess a high school degree, let alone a college degree, that vote just because they want to. The is a massive suply of ignorance and pride that fall into play with the Electoral College.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president they choose, but for a slate of electors, who in turn, elect the president. For instance, if you wanted to vote for a specific person you would vote for a slate of electors pledged to that person. This method of voting is curupt and should be abolished. The people in American should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the largest election crisis in a century; the system could have lead to much worse than that. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for choosing electors, adn that those electors could alwyas defy the will of the people.

In conclusion, why is the Electoral college unhealthy? This system of voting is outdated and has many flaws throughout its system. Without this system being changed is could have a tremendous affect in the future of the United States. This irrational system lacks a basis in reality. The arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.

Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election, like the one we have today. There are so many wrong things with the Electoral College. Under this system, voters vote not for the president, but for the state of electors. which who  in turn elect the president.

The disaster factor is when the american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. The system also allows for much worse. Basically the system want's to see us fail. If the system would realize how bad there hurting us and making us feel like our  vote doesn't matter. For example, again the 2000 scandle with the votes for president. We voted for this guy and he won most of the votes from the states but the Electoral College desided to give it to the other guy. Some of us just don't get how that works.

State senator, i believe that we should keep the electoral college because it it not only benifits congress it aso benifits the president who is running to be our leader as well and also our electors.

The electoral college has been made from our founding fathers in the constitution it shows a meaning, a meaning not only to us but also to The United states and in the most part its total strangers who pick these people its a political party  it may seem unfair that the votes we are putting in is for the electors to run but its a show of value it shows the the electors get help with votes and so does the president just like it may be in the other side of the green grass as well.

""The Electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast""(pg22).

In each state the cadinate that is running for that paticular has their own group of electors that in safe hands its a great thing to know that people that are being chosen are being reviewed by state laws as well to be exact and either way we help choose our state electors its not about the specific people its about all of us and how we contributre to the votes to our candinates in the electoral college we are not only helping the electors the electors are helping the presidnt as well and most of all we are helping United State Of America Founding Fathers.

6481E8B9CD64,"To whom it may concern,

I, PROPER_NAME, think it is best to keep the electoral colles, but here is why. Some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the consititution is restored. The candiate must have trans regional appleal, meaning he/she must be all for each region & not just one, (South, Northeastern, etc.).  From this the residents of the other region are likelt to feel disfranchised-- to feel like their votes do not count, and that with no regard for their interests, the president is not really the president.

As a citizen I would say that if the president, only did what half of the regions had said, then I would not be satisfied with what he is doing. When you go into office, you go into office for everyone, not just one region, but ALL regions. Wether or not the president haave a trans-appeal, each region does not have enough electoral votes to elect a president on their own anyway. Some say the electoral college is unfair. outdated, irrational, because they favor most daily assertions without much basis in reality. However the lectoral college, can be unfair. Most arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much base reality.

To feel as if the president is not on your side, i dont imagine that being any fun, that to me would be like rewarding one child and not the other for the same action. We all are equal, wether by race, color, or age. We are all human, and we demand to be treated equal, if we dont get equal, keep trying until you do. Its always too early to give up. Always push yourself to high extents just like these canidates and maybe one day it will be you standing up for the majority vote, only hoping that the voters do not pick favorites, off of location. Before you decide make sure you know who youre voting for, and that there is a chance, that folur years from now, they could be re elected again, so please, put some thought into our society, and what social conflict does to us! America hass been torn apart because, of beliefs, religion, and democracies, and possibly is still suffering from all of these things, as i sit here and type this.

Although they maybe known to be unfair, outdated, irrational, and an non-democractic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. But I believe it is fair because the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between electon of the president by a vote of congress and election of the prsident by a popular vote of qualified citizens and that when we vote we vote for electors who basically take the side of the peoples voice but do further research on the two people that are running for president and vice president. and the electoral college requires a presodential to have transregional appeal so that there won't be a solid region that has one favorite canidate because a canidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president and the other region will feel that thier votes won't count and that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he rally isn't their president. the electoral college restores some of the weight i the political balance that larger states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution and avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast whcih makes the electoral college a better and more fair way of voting.            ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
7E3E96B4F614,"Dear state senator, I think that we should change to start voting by popular vote because it will be easier for the voters and is a more realistic way of voting.

When voting and following the rules of the electoral college, many voters get confused. As is says in source 2, many voters vote for the wrong person. They also don't always get controll over who they vote for. Say they voted for one canidate to be their state senator, well with that one person comes many people that have ""pledged"" themselves to that canidate. They would be voting for the canidate and these many people that have pledged themselves to him and they don't even know it.

Also as they say in source 2, the election of 2000 was a huge mishap in presidential election history. In states like Louisiana, they had people replace democratic electors so that the popular vote that would've went to one of the canidates, didn't actually go through. Although the electoral college is good for getting exact numbers and helps solve disputes( source 3)it is an uruly and untrustworthy way of voting and should not be used anymore. Voters are easily confused when voting and many do not follow up on what is happening during election time. I think that a better way to votee would be to vote more often and give the electors another chance to be relected so that after a few months if voters changed their mind then they could reelect someone else.

Popular vote is a much better idea not only becuase it is more realistic, but because it is easier to understand. Even some of our presidents like Richard Nixon and Bob Dole have thought that this was the way to go. Not only do they believe this, but they lost their presidency votes becuase of the electoral college. I think that they are just trying to scam voters and pick someone that would be best for them, not for our country. I think that by using the electoral college method, they are cheating into picking the winners, but if we used popular vote, this wouldnt happen.

23FBB9F44F8A,"Senator of Florida, the electoral college should continue and not change. The electoral college has helped America vote evenly on politics. This helps avoid any conflicts with candidates. Without the electoral college, we would have to try and use a new method. Using a new method is not only time consuming but, nobody is sure it can have a certain outcome.

The electoral college dismisses the problem of run-off elections. Candidates wouldn't have to worry about not receiving a majority vote. ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Cliton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively)."" (Posner, 22)

Using the electoral college will give you certanity of the outcome. Since most states go off a certain basis, it is very likely that the state will have a win based on their electoral votes. ""In [2012's] election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state."" (Posner, 18)

Conversly, it can lead to another disaster. People do have the possibility of rearranging votes so a certain candidate wins. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)"" (Plumer, 11)

4E0179E2F024,"Dear Senator,

The Presidential Election is one of the most important events that goes on in the United States. At the core of this election is the Electoral College. The only problem is, the college has many flaws. Like in Source 1, it states that our Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election by a popular vote from the citizens who qualify. As you know the E.C consists of the selection of electors, meeting of electors where they vote for the President and Vice, and the counting of the votes by Congress. There are 538 electors, 538 votes, and it takes a majority of 270 votes to win the election. This flawed system has been around too long and it needs to be altered. I am in favor of getting rid of the E.C and going to winner by a popular vote.

If the Presidential candidate is favored by more than 50% of the country then he or she should win. Like in Source 2 history shows that in the past candidates have clearly won the popular vote, but sill lost the presidency race. The problem with the current system we have in place is that the people who are supposed to have a direct voice in the government do not. Instead the people vote for other people who they are supposed to trust vote in favor of their opinion. I can see how some people believe in this system of trust, however some history has shown us otherwise.

History has shown that electors can go against the opinion of the public. When you vote for electors most of the time they in turn vote for what the people want. The only thing is you are not ensured that this will occur. In the end it is up to the elector who can decide however they wish. Personally for the U.S. it would be more effective to go to winner by popular vote, not only because of the unsureness of the electors, but also because that is what the people want. Another valid arguement to get rid of the whole Electoral College process is in Source 2, it states that sometimes voters get confused with the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. That could be detrimental to the country if the wrong person for the job was elected. If it was the popular vote sytem the selection of candidates would be clear and easy to understand, which leads to less mistakes when voting.

The view of getting rid of the Electoral College is actually quite popular. In Source 2 it tells us Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and others have all agreed that we should abolish the Electoral College. Going all the way back to the beginning of our country we started off on the base priciple that the people must have a direct voice in the government. That is the reason our country was made a democracy. The Electoral College has bent those principles and hasn't fully allowed the voice of the people to be heard. With the popular vote put in place their are no middle men, it is just the people voicing what they want and who they want to represent them.

Looking over the information that has been presented it is clear that the Electoral College has to go. The system is flawed for many reasons such as the popular candidate not winning, voices not being ensured that they will be heard, and the confusing system of not voting directly for your President. If the change of winner by popular vote in the election is made none of the previous flaws will be present. The popular vote sytem will ensure the people get what they want and the process is completely fair. For these reasons it is in our society's best interest that our government makes this change. Abolish the Electoral College and bring on a new age of simple and fair elections!

C9C6D699BCEA,"Dear Mr. Senator,

It has come to my, as well as many other's attention, that the presidential election is something that could potentially have disasterous outcomes. You, and many polititions like yourself, have been using a system called the Electoral College that people such as Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, and Jimmy Carter have been suggesting to demolish for years now. Personally, I find it quite alarming that although this process has been with us for all of this time, we have found the flaws yet still continue to take the risks. This is not simply about picking a president anymore, this is about the freedom of America.

All in all, the Electoral College at face value seems like a good idea for choosing a winner. It seems to make sense that we would choose electors who the president trusts that would elect him president, but when you think about it, something feels rather off. First of all, the general public places their ballots in the appropriate box believing that they are voting for their ideal candidates. In reality, however, they are voting for their electors instead. Most people who vote are unaware of this factor, and the lack of information pertaining to it is unsettling. Not only that, but the electors are not chosen by the people. Does this not contridict ""By the people, for the people?"" Where exactly do these people fit in?

Furthermore, the electors cannot always be trusted with voting for their respective candidates. This is something referred to as the disaster factor. While most who are picked by the candidate themself are trustworthy, electors are people who are not in office, therefore may not be as trusting. Electors are an uncertain factor and in some complex cases, even two slates for electors can be sent which could create a hectic mess. If you are going to vote for a president who you wish to win, and your vote goes to an elector that won't come through, it takes all of the power away from the people and places it right back into the state's hands.

Another thing to consider when pondering the validity of this process is the potential of a tie with electoral voting. In this case, the election would be in the power of the House of Representatives, and the representatives from each state would decide the winner. We have had many opportunities for a tie during the elections, one even being the difference of 5,559 in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii. The problem with this is the loss of power within the nation. Once again, the people will no longer have a say in the voting and the energy it took them to decide on a candidate and go out to vote will be for virtually nothing. The people will no longer be represented. If something like this were to happen to our country, surely people from every state would be outraged.

Now, you may be thinking to yourself, why should I be worried? Sure, it is unlikely to get a tie in the electoral votes. However, something as huge as deciding the leader of this country should not have even a single flaw in it. Horrible and unexpected things happen everyday, why couldn't we get a tie as well? Now, the main problem with getting rid of the Electoral College is the possibility of run-off elections. In defense of this, the Electoral College is the main reason that we have run-off elections in the first place. It prevents people in certain areas from voting because they feel as if they will have no say in the final result. Even if people still voted for the fun of it, it was only because of chance or political preference. With an election by popular vote, the chances of a run-off election would be significantly lower as people would realize the power they had in deciding it.

As you finish reading this, I ask you to consider all of the points I have made. I am certain that choosing to elect by popular vote would have more benefits than sticking to the old and flawed plan, the Electoral College. Endless proof points to the conclusion that this theory is correct, as the process of picking electors to elect the president is redundant and confusing. Finally, with all of the things that could go wrong, using a new system would be one step forward in making our nation even greater.

Mainly, Electoral College help us vote for our president. In the source ""What is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register assert that the winner of the president is ""election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" The more popular votes our states is given the higher chance that president is going to be elected. ""Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president"" out of 538 votes for a presidnet to win. With an Electoral College each president have to get at least 270 elector votes from all the 50 states for them to be president.

786C86C9ACFE,"Dear Senator,

I am astudent from Lakewood Ranch High School in Bradenton. I have recently been informed about wanting to make certain changes to the election process. I am not of an age to vote, yet I am informed about how the election process works and the role the electorial college plays withing it.

The electoral college is a proces, not a place, which consists of 538 electors. During this process the public casts their vote for their favorite candidate. The votes are added up in each state and whichever candidate has got the most votes is for whom the state's representatives will vote towards. Each state's number of representatives is determined acoording to polpulation with California having the most electorial votes at 55. Electors can change their votes for whomever they'd like, yet it is highly unlikeley. In order for a candidate to win an election he or she must obtain 270 votes out of 538.

Some may argue that the people's votes don't necessarily influence the outcome of the election since electors can still change for whom they vote for, so they request that the popular vote  determine who becomes president. This idea implies that all eligible citizens in the U.S.  to vote in the election when truth being over half of the nationwide population does not cast a vote, with the leading cause being apathy. Also it is implied that all citizens are informed about who they  vote for. During a presidential campaign, a political party will put most of their efforts in ""swing states"", these are the states with the most electors. This means that people from smaller states will recieve little or no information about the candidates causing the citizens to cast a blind vote.

The main reason of why the electorial campaign should determine who wins instead of the popular vote is the public can be too easily influenced. If a particular candidate is preferred in certain areas, the population in or around that area might be influenced to vote for that individual. Also people can be peer-pressured into voting for someone they might not agree with.

In my opinion the U.S. population is not ready for that kind of responsability. The electoral college was established to help the election proces run smoothly and it has worked for decades without any major flukes or flaws. So why change now?    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

D9B5F55E6705,"To keep the Electoral College, or to switch to election by popular vote for the President of the United States, anyone can see the right answer is to keep the Electoral College, despite it not being the most democratic choice around. Many see it as being a waste of time, seeing as how they truly can't vote for the President they want. Yet most still can't see that the Electoral College is not the most easiest thing to get rid of. It has been with them ever since their Founding Fathers established it along with the Constitution.

Keeping the Electoral Colllege is best for the US, even if it isn't that fair to the people. But first, what is the Electoral College anyways? Well, the Electoral College is not an actual college, its actually a process. The Founding Fathers made it as ""a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress, and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens"", as stated in paragraph one of the article, lines 3-6. A somewhat tedious task to get voted for a whole entire country, but it gets the job done.

The Electoral College system has been reported as ""unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (paragraph 14, lines 1 and 2). Most of what that statement does say is true, it is pretty unfair to the people who want to vote for their president, it's extremely outdated and needs an update fast, and its pretty irrational at times. Yet does that mean it can be bad? No, not really. As stated in paragraph 16, lines 1-3; ""Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)"". The statment means that basically each slate chooses some electors that go with the popular vote, and they are shipped off to go and submit the votes and the electoral votes, where the task they are given is rarely betrayed, or not done. Yet, the word 'rarely' still sticks, and not many can just simply deny that it is not there. The rest of the statment in paragraph 16 continues onto lines 4-6, ""[;however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" So in simple terms, you can get the electoral vote which can put you ahead, but you won't win with just that under your belt. The people still matter, and their vote can still count against you.

Finally, let's get explaining ""Why should we keep the Electoral College."" There are easily 5 reasons for retaining it. The 5 reason why we should keep it, are as follows:

1)Certainty of Outcome; certainty of outcome basically states that anything can happen, but anything bad won't neccesarily always happen. Let's take paragraph 18 for example, which talks about this reason. It states in lines 16-19, ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number, but is highly unlikely..."" Anything can happen, even a tie.

2)Everyone's President is as it states. The President is everyone's , not just the people in the south, north, or anywhere in the United States. If anyone just simply appealed to a certain region in the US, the other regions would feel as if ""the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president"" (paragraph 19, last line).

3)Swing States, the main practice of the Electoral College. The higher the state has with electoral votes, the more likely the canidate will be able to win. However, ""Voters in toss-up states are more likely to play close attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing canidates-knowing that they going to decide the election"" (paragraph 20, lines 4-8). This means that they will not be easily be persuaded.

4)Big States, as some can guess from the phrase, 'Bigger is better', that phrase truly shines here. the bigger states, such as California or Texas, have higher electoral votes than some of the smaller states, such as New Jersey or Rhode Island. As it states in paragraph 21, lines 9-12, ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does...""

5)Avoid Run-off Elections, where ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidates receives a majority of the votes cast."" (paragraph 22, lines 1-3) That means that the Electoral College tries to make sure that their is no tie.

Those are the reasons why the Electoral College should not be abolished. Surely someone can put up a counter argument to make this small article to shame, but in the end its truly all of the matter of opinions, where no ones is truly ""the best"" or ""true"". This is simply the opinion of many in the US.    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I am in favor of keeping the Electoral college. i am in favor of keeping Electoral college because it was the original decision made by our founding fathers. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The Electoral college consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to select the president. under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the elctoral college. for this reason, in the following discussion, the word ""state"" also refers to  the District of columbia..

most states have a ""winner-takes-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidates.

but people  like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO think that we should abolish the electoral college.

although i am in favor of it, there are some disadvantages to electoral college. under the electoral college system, voters vote for a a slate of electors who in turn elect the president.

287CDB5117E0,"There are pros and cons for both whywe should keep and get rid of the Electoral college.

You are voting for the electors, not the president. Voters don't get to choose the electors. Some electors might even defy the wishes of the people who voted for them. There are 538 electoral votes, which is an even number so their could be a tie.

It is rare that eletors will defy the wishes of the voters, but it has happened. In 2000 Gore had a high percentage of the popular vote than electoral votes. This is so rare that the only other time that it happened was in 1888. Most states give electoral votes on a winner-takes-all basis, some split the votes a little bit, because of this there is a clear winner. In the case of electoral votes, no one region of the United States can win alone, so the votes are spread out. If presidential elections were decided directly by the popular vote than region favorites would be elected abd the rest of the voters would feel that they did'nt vote for the president that was elected. Presidential candidates are most likely to campaign in ""swing states"" that they know they cn win the electoral votes from. Voters in these states are most likely to pay close attention to both candidates, so the most thoughtful voters will get the most representation. The most populated states or the ""big states"" get the most electoral votes, meaning the states with the most people the the most representation. With the Electoral College you increase your chances of having a majority (fifty percent or more). While there can be a tie, this is rare.

Since there are good arguements on both sides, a decision has to be made after careful thought.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

My name is Jacob and I would like to discuss with you some of the problems with the way the presidential election works. I believe the system using the Electoral College is unfair and can have its negative outcomes. In my opinion, the President should be chosen through the popular vote. There have been several times to date where presidents have one the popular vote but still lost the election due to the Electoral college. Often the President will have won by both Electoral votes and the popular votes but that isnt always the case. The electoral which has 538 electors are people as well. What is to stop them from voting who they want and not what the popular vote says in that state? They are people that are put in a position of power to choose who the next president will be. The obvious choice would be for them to pick who they want as president. Voters may also get confused about how the system works. They may thinkn that their vote doesnt count, that only the electors votes count. I believe that using a system where the popular vote is what chooses the election. This can solve several problems such as confusion and biased electors. If people felt that their vote counted, they might even want to get more involved.

I belive that we shouldn't keep the Electoral College. The election by popular vote is more fair for electing a president.

First off, going with election by popular vote is more fair. For example, in the article ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" the author states, "" Obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So,other things be equal, a large states gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" Its not fair that small towns/states gets less attention for the president because their opinion and votes dont really matter if they get less attention. Another reason for my argument is, ""Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in Califonia. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attentionto the campaign than they would have if the president we picked by popular vote.."" Proving that not many people have a say when voting.

In addition, the election by popular vote seems more better. For example, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but or a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Why is it that we arent actually voting for a president? That other people are technically voting for us. If we were to vote by popular vote people would actually feel like they are voting for who they want in office.""Consider that state legislatres are technically responsible for picking electors and that those people could always defy the will of the people."" So much time goes into election day but for what? We just vote for how we feel but not for who we vote for.

As Americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. We have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first admendment. We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a ""popular"" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?

Bradford Plumer, author of

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Best-laid Defenses of System are Wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. He elaborates further to say that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presidet, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the ""priveledge"" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

The next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. If Florida voted canidate A, but North Dakota voted for canidate B, canidate A is bound to win because Florida has twenty-nine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one canidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first canidate has already lost.

Now most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. They are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society's ethics. However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.

Mr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. However, every four years comes around, and yet I do not see a change in anything. I do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. But, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised?

The electoral college is something that the founding fathers established for a choice of voting. You can either vote your election in congress or by a vote of the citizens. In my opinion, I don't really think that this is a good idea. No one really knows who's voting for who. And most of the time, voters don't always control who they get to vote for. But this can be a good thing sometimes because it helps keep everything in order.

First of all, the electoral college is a bad thing because nobody really knows who's voting for who. Most of the time, soem voters get confused about the whole thing and end up voting for the wrong person. During the election, most people get, as I said before, confused. These people get confused because there's too much going on. theres one side voting for one person, the other side voting for the other, then out of nowhere here comes like, 3 more people that are racing, and no one even knew whos these people were because everyone is too caught up with the states votes being all over the place to focus on anything else.

Secondly, I really think that the electoral college is not that good of an idea because most people that are voting don't even get a choice on who they want to vote for. The legislative branch is technically suppossed to choose the electors of the state. The electors are the people who allow peoples votes to go through.

The Electoral College is stupid and we should not use it.  I have many reasons to believe that this is an unfair system that is adulterating our country's wonderful ways.

The first reason for why I despise this system is because we have had people with more than half of the country voting for them not be elected President.  This is due to winning by just enough in certain states that you get their elector votes.  If you win by 51% in a state with 4 electoral votes, but someone else wins by 99% in a state with 3 electoral votes, you will have more electoral votes, but less popular votes.  In the system that we are set up with, electoral votes is how you will get elected for President.  This happened during the Presidental Election in 2000, when Gore won the popular vote, but Busch won the electoral votes and was elected President.  It also happened several times before, most recently in 1888.

With the Electoral College it is more likely that a tie will happen.  This is beacuse there are only 538 electoral votes, which is a lot less than 300 million popular votes, for every U.S. citizen.  If there is a tie, then the Senate and House of Representatives has to do all this stupid stuff to figure out who wins.

In the process of the Electoral College, the voters in the smaller states are given more power than those in the larger states.  Every state gets a minimum of 3 electoral votes, and then more are added depeding on the size of the state's population.  WIth 3 votes for a population of 500,000, Wyoming has more votes per citizen than the larger states do.  Large states with ten of millions of people may have only a few more votes than Wyoming does, giving it's individual citizens more power in choosing the President.

Because of the Electoral College, Presidential Canidates spend a large portion of their time in ""Swing States,"" like Ohio or Florida, and little or no time to states with predictable outcomes.  A swing state is a state that could go either way in the election, so the canidates spend a lot of time convincing it's populants to vote for them, because of the winner-takes-all method.  This is unfair to the states with predicted outcomes.

Also, this is presidency here, not what game we should play in Gym! majority vote makes absolutely NO sense whatsoever. I mean come on, we are deciding the next LEADER of our country! Again. everyones wishes should be accounted for.

Now im not saying that popular vote is perfect either but it sure beats the college. there are too many variables for the college. too many areas where something can go wrong.

The most basic reason why the electoral college is unfair to our country is because not everyone is fairly represented. For example, there are 55 representatives in California to represent 35 million voters. As you can see, it is an unfair ratio. It is impossible for the House's votes to reflect the views of the people in California. That also means that since each state only has one fianl vote, a state such as Wyoming, who has 500,000 voters, would have as much say as California, with 35 million. California has more people, and my making every state have equal representation, it is messing up representation in states like California.

In the system we have today, it is very easy to have a dealocked election. In 1968, a mere 41,971 votes would have caused a major deadlock in the election. The same thing happened again in 1976, if 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii decided to vote differently. In both cases, and few thousand votes could have caused a serious disaster. History tends to repeat itself, so if the almost exact situation happened in the span of less than ten years, what makes you think it won't happen again?

The electoral college creates an unfair system to gaining votes. In 2000, 17 states, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, who are home to some of the largest media markets, didn't even get the chance to see a campaign ad. If you were a canidate, wouldn't you want your ad to be seen in the some of the largest media markets? The canidates had already thought they won those states, which is a ignorant move to make. Because of the electoral college, and the unspoken rules that have been set in place about certain states views, the canidates missed a greatly helpful opprotunity to gain more votes.

However, many might think that the electoral college is a good system because it gives a clear winner, and it makes the states have equal representation. If the people are barely being represented, and a state with less than a million voters has as much say as a state with 35 million voters, then it doesn't matter if the process gives a clear winner. The people want to have a say, not someone choosing for them.

The electoal college may have been a good idea back when it was first created, however, times are changing and the number of people being able to vote is growing day by day. The voters want to give their opinion through voting, and by having the electoral college in place, it is making voting unfair, irrational, and nearly impossible to do.

Thank you for your time.

29534C6BD280,"I think the election system should change to most popular state votes because it's only counting Americans who represent the Democratic and the Republican. The Electoral College does get its votes and completes the system but you have to vote for a slate of electors, not just that but voters can't always control their vote and voters would get confused about the electors and probably would vote for the incorrect candidate. The Electoral College is unfair.

In 1960, the Louisiana legislature nearly replaced the Democratic electors with new electors so John F. Kennedy wouldn't get the most popular vote, while that was going on electors were being defiant about voting for their party's candidate and voted for whoever they wanted to choose. also in 1960, a state sent two slates of electors to congress in Hawaii, but Vice President Richard Nixon validated his opponent's eclectors without establishing a precedent.

If the state uses a different system such as counting votes from different states, we wouldn't have as much problems we have with it now because the votes in the electoral college are outdated and irrational, even Bob Dole said ""Abolish the electoral college!"". Americans who vote in the electoral college would not be confused and fussy anymore about who their voting in a different type of system because the electoral college system would sometimes be unorganized and not allow equal votes.

An anachronism is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled and receives the most popular votes wins the president election. the Electoral College method is not democratic because the electors elect the president only, Americans are only voting for the slate of electors and voting for the presidentail candidate. The winner of the electoral vote doesn't win the most popular votes, but in 2000, Al Gore had more popular votes than George Bush but less electoral votes than Bush

So the reason why we should retain the electoral college sytem because it's not fair because they avoid the run off elections which happened in 1968 and 1992 to Nixon and Clinton but the electoral college reduced the electoral votes in the run off elections, the electoral college never thinks about the outcome and almost have the winning president lose, in 2012 Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote and had the same percentage of popular votes than Romney, and the electoral college turn off potential voters for a candidate knowing their votes will have no effect because they don't pay attention to the campaign.

The Electoral College is somewhere they vote for President and Vice President and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. A majority of 270 electors votes is also required to elect the President. The 23rd Amendment of the Constitution is the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and they treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ''Certicate of Ascertainment'' listing all the candidates who had ran for President in your state along with the names their respective electors.

The thing thats wrong with the electoral college is that the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century to the system that allows for much worse. Because each state casts only one vote to the single representatives from California to who the represent 35 million voters. The best arguments in favor mostly assertions without much basis  in the reality. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote the party's nominee is possible that the winner of the electoral vote not win the national popular votes..

3C5CFABBA1F0,"Every four years since the founding of the United States, a president has been elected by the people to lead the U.S. According to source 1, the system used to select the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral College involves voters voting for president they want, as normal, and then the president that got the majority vote in that state gets all of that state's electoral votes. Supporters of the Electoral College claim that it is good that the presidents focus more on swing states, and that they are more likely to be the thoughtful voters, but there is zero evidence shown to support this, and it makes presidents focus on states disproportionally. The Electoral College should be abolished and replaced by the popular vote system, as it is an outdated method compared to modern technology, makes the vote of an individual seem even more insignificant, and makes presidents not campaign in states that are small or loyal to them.

Since the Electoral College was hundreds of years ago, it does not account for all of the new technologies that have been developed since then. The founding fathers could not have possibly thought that it would be possible to easily count all of the nation's votes with a machine, but now it is possible. It is likely that the reason they thought of the Electoral College in the first place was because it would mean that they could spread out the tallying of votes between the states, instead of doing it all at once. Nowadays though, there are computers that can count votes faster than ever imagined. Popular vote is now a viable method since every person's vote can be accurately counted.

Due to the Electoral College relying on a majority rules system, the vote of a single person can be completely insignificant. According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody's vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn't vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on who to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, ""... those electors could always defy the will of the people,"" and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an anti-thesis to democracy, because a citizen's vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points.

Both those who support the Electoral College system and those who oppose it agree that the Electoral College puts a much bigger focus on swing states and states with large populations, according to sources 2 and 3. To put this into perspective, here's an example of why supporting big swing states should not be rewarded. The US has 6 states. 5 are completely democrats and each have populations of 20. 1 is half democrat half republican and has a population of 100(assume 20 people equals an electoral vote). If the republican presidential candidate convinces a single democrat in the big state to vote for them, they will get the majority vote in that state and get 5 electoral votes. This results in the democratic presidential candidate, with 149 people supporting him, tying with the republican presidential candidate, with 51 people supporting him. Simple logic shows that the opinion of 149 people is more important than that of 51 people, so a popular vote system would have been best in this situation. The focus on certain states is such a popular method by the presidential candidates, that, according to source 2, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all...""Big states and swing states should not receive much more attention per citizen from the presidential candidates than little states do.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems ""easier,"" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.

Senator

I think we should change the election by popular votes for the President of the United States. It's a more accurate process and who knows what people running for office has up there arm. The electoral college voting has a repeated tendancy to vote for the state of electors and that way they end up voting for the President. People prefer to vote for exactly who and what they choose to vote for and Electoral college isn't the way to go for it. What would happen when we run out of electoral votes just stick and choose a President? In what world is that fair and accurate?

Popular votes will actually help the voters voting and it might even be a faster process, whose to say, it could even be better. People aren't voting for President anymore which is the most important person in the senate, besides you the right hand man. The Citizen's voting are starting to vote for the state electors do to where they originate or live in. Citizens have not yet grasped the rules of voting and tend to vote unfairly and not for the real reasons we urgently need these people in house,senate, or office. In some states electors refused to even vote for their particular party's candidate  and choose to vote for who ever they wish to vote for which is a good thing. these electors prefer to vote for whoever will do a better job in office and that's what were scoring for with popular votes. What happens to votes when there's a run off, because there isn't enough votes to be held accountable for? Thats a question to think about , because there could be a lot of problems to be the cause of it.

To have a certain number of people vote for who they choose to be President is surprisingly unrealistic. Why choose the majority rule when you could have thousands of People praying for a change vote for a change in their their future for a better life. The ""winner-take-all"" system has to be the most challeging systems of them all but seems to work out after all. ""Electoral College is the best way!"" what happened to the People actually living off of the rules that the Electoral college Voters choose for the people all together? It's time to make a change, why not start now and see how the congress feels. The biggest Decision that should be made should be made fairly by the people, the citizens. In paragraph 13 it even states ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" why not make a change make a difference.

To whom ever it may concern, Big States are the main key. If we could get the big states to take part in the Popularity vote the smaller states will join in. Hoping for the best the Popularity Votes will soon rise and all the discrepencies won't be needed.

E5C0A11D06E2,"Dear Mr. Senator,

The citizens of your state are crying injustice, but nothing is being done to serve them. The Electoral College goes against the Bill of Rights opening words of ""We the People"". The current system of electing the President is more complex and less beneficial than choosing our leader through popular vote. The popular vote actually listens to the people of the United States' opinion and how they want this country run. The Electoral College has many faults such as in the case of electoral overuling popular vote, possible corruption of state senators (no accusation presented), and could lead to the rare event of a tie.

Such as in the election of 2000, Al Gore should have won the race. The people poke through the popular vote to choose him, but the Electoral College thought otherwise. As stated in the article, that usually state senators choose the representatives of the state in the Electoral College, if bribery and corruption affect our nations such as those in the Miuddle East, the presidential race can and will be rigged in one party's favor. Due to Mane and Nebraska policy of ""proportional representation"" could lead to a tie.

As you can see, the Electoral College has many faults and is outdated due to the rapid population increase of our nation and reasons stated above. Some may argue there will be inaccuracies with popular vote whereas we already use the popular vote today as a way of forecasting the oucome and seeing the people's real choice.

4933B56F9E7B,"Dear State Senator,

You should keep the electoral college vote the same without the popular vote because the winning candiate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Aswell as the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast.

To begin, the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invairably exceeds his share of the popular vote. for example in the 2012 election, Oboma received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is very possible like the total number of votes-538-is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. It is less likely to have a dispute over the popular vote but it is more likely to have a dispute over the electoral vote. In 2012's election voters in toss-up states are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing canidates- knowing they are going to decide the election. Causing the popualr vote to go up. When we as a community should not want to president be chosen by a popular vote but by the electoral vote, it is only fair!

Also, the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning the majority in the electoral college. Did you know that there is someone from a small state and they only get three electoral votes. Well, they are not treated equal and only the large states get more of the attention from presidential candidates than a small state ever will.

It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. You should keep the electoral college vote the same without the popular vote because the winning candiate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Aswell as the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast. So I'm going to leave you with this. What will you choose? The popular vote of the electoral vote? It's up to you not.

228001464BD0,"According to a Gallup poll taken shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters prefer a direct election over the electoral college. Electors could always defy the will of the people. Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The abolishment of the electoral college will make choosing a president less difficult and allow the people to make their own choice.

In the article, In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, written by Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College is widely regarded as belonging to the past and not being able to fit the present. In 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, Bush took the presidency, despite popular demand. Voters can't always control who their electors vote for. They sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

With a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. According to The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, written by Bradford Plumer, with the even number of total votes of electors there is a chance there can be a tie between the number of electors that chose each president, in that case the House of Representatives would vote on the president. This would make the state of Wyoming with a single representive representing 500,000 voters have as much say as the 55 representatives in California who represent 35 million voters. The House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect what the people want.

On the off-chance that the electors you voted for won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and who they elect would get the electoral votes. Anyone not holding public office can be an elector. The electors get choosen depending on the state they represent. The whole election process would be easier if the voters were able to directly state who they want to elect.                      ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

A majoriy of 270 electoral votes are required to elect a president, therefore in my opinion a popula vote would have mor meaning, beacause it's more people the vote would be chosen fr the mayority making the rest of the people satisfied. The number of citizens all togete versus the number of the electors at the Electoral College is superior; the people are te ones that follow the law might as well let them choose he president thats going to run the country and establish laws.

The electoral college system prevents us from voting for the presidet directly, instead they make us vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the pesident. For example if you were to live in Texas and wanted to vote for a president you'd have to vote for a slate of 34 elector of that political party that are pleged to him or her, on the off-chance that those electors won the statewide elections. The electors get picked at state conventions, the states party's central committee and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Also electos can be anyone not holding public office.

Furthermore the best argument against the electoral college is the disaster factor. Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 disaster was he biggest crisis in elections that century since the system allows much worse. Consider the fact that the state legislatures are in a way responsible for piking electors and those elector could defy the will of the people back in 1960; what tells you that they stopped doing it?

The electoral college system has a lo of flaws and they can choose if they want o do what the peopl think is best or just take mater into their own hands and do as they plese.

I dont think a few 100 random citizens should pick the president, i think the people should beccause what if the entire nation votes for one person but, the few 100 people vote for someone else. With only a few hundred electors a rich person could bribe them into choosing who they wanted and it could be someone who got no votes. It is unfair this country has 100s of millions of people and to leave it up to 370 people is proposterus.

Secondly we dont get to vote for the president and the electoral college says oh well they voted for him so lets pick him, no we vote for slate of electors who vote for whoever the they feel like and sometimes there random people.

Thirdly you votes dont count lets just say u live in texas and wanted to vote for for john kerry youd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry.

3A3AD368D10E,"The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it. The Electoral College was a smart idea in the seventeen and eighteen hundreds, but as our country continues to change, it is necessary to change the way that we elect our leaders. The Electoral College has remained untouched and exactly the same for hundreds of years and this has caused it to be extremely outdated. Not only is it far too outdated and complicated to help our voting process, but the Electoral College does not give the voters voice; instead, it takes it away from them. The Electoral College also can lead to concerning situations that the country and its people do not want to be put in. For these reasons, I strongly encourage you to make the change and switch to election by popular vote.

The question of whether or not to abolish or keep the Electoral College in tact is a heavily debated one, but it is clear that getting rid of the Electoral College will be highly beneficial to the voters of America. The Electoral College was established hundreds of years ago when our Constitution came about and it created a complicated process to elect the President and Vice President of the United States. Our country is changing day by day, and we certainly have made monumental changes since the Electoral College came to be. According to Bradford Plumer, author of, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" a poll was taken by Gallup in the year 2000 that showed that less than just forty percent of Americans support the election system that we have now. This proves that it is time for a change and that the system that we currently have in place has been in place for far too long. The everchanging United States of America is in desperate need of an up-to-date election system that fits the current needs of the American people. The Electoral College is not only outdated, but it is also an extremely complex voting method. In an article entitled, ""What Is the Electoral College,"" written by the Office of the Federal Register, it is explained that the Electoral College is a lengthy process that involves the choosing of electors and the issuing of Certificates of Ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted. The Electoral College does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially, I believe that America should begin to elect its Presidents using the popular voting method.

Moreover, the Electoral College should no longer be the voting method of the American people because the people are given no voice with the Electoral College process. In his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a non-democratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote.

Most importantly, using the Electoral College as our voting method can lead to some serious problems. The replacing of electors that oppose the popular vote result is a problem that comes with using the Electoral College. Not only is it not hard to accomplish, but it has happened before. According to Bradford Plumer in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" in the early 1960s, people who favored races being seperated in society were almost able to replace Democratic electors with a new set of electors who supported the opposite party. Also, some corrupt electors who are not pleased with the popular vote will simply vote for whomever they please. Electors clearly have trouble being trusted and there is obviously some extreme dislike for the system we have now. The Electoral College also causes some problems when instances like a tie in the electoral vote come about. In this case, a tie in the Electoral College would be thrown to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for the President. The Electoral College brings about uneccessary problems that could all be avoided if the country converted the way of electing to election by popular vote.

In summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents. The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications. For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.            ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I belive that the people should get the popular vote and that the Electoral College should not be kept because it doesn't exactly help the people. They get who they want even if the people voted differently,which seems extremely unfair to the people. It has also been declared that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational (14), so why would we want to keep it?

The people should get the popular vote because if the people wanted the elecltors candidate they would have voted for them instead of voting for the other competitor.

Why would the electors even try to ask the people to vote if they're just going to decide the final vote anyways?

Although they don't elect who becomes President, they are the ones who are more likely to really listen to the competing candidates and know who to vote for than careless voters who vote for no obvious reason or are told to. They are the most thoughtful voters, which could really help the U.S. pick a great President for the next 4 to even 8 years. The more votes from those who pay attention to the election, the better chance of having a great President.

Bigger states are important to the candidates in the election. A larger population would mean more votes, and more votes would avoid a tie between the candidates. For example, Florida is a larger state. In 2012, the popular vote was very close because Florida had more electoral votes. Wyoming, a smaller state, had only 3 electoral votes. In other words, larger states get more attention from presidential candidates than smaller states do.

The Electoral College avoids run-off elections, which is when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. When there's a tie in votes, great pressure arises and the presidential election process is greatly complicated. The Electoral College avoids this problem, reduces the pressure and produces a clear winner.

The Electoral College may not be a democratic process and may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carring their state, but is important in a variety of ways; including swing states, votes between big and small states, and avoiding run-off elections. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote that may decide an election.

Electoral College .The

Electoral Collage the process,not a place Founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between elections of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by the popular vote of qualified citizens.

Electoral Collage consis of the selection of the electors where they vote for president and vice presidence,and the counting of the electoral votes by the congress. The

Electoral Collage consis of the 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to select the president. Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the

Electoral Collage .Each canidate running for president in our state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by the canidates political party,but states laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.

President election is held every few hours on tuesday after the first monday in november. You help choose our states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for president because when you vote canidate you are actually voting for your canidates electors. After the presidential election your governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all the candidates who ran for presidenty in your stare along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate of ascertainment declares who the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent. Your state certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official recors of the president election.

Why people think the

Electoral collage is wrong? Because over 60% percent of the voter would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year the voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Whats the bad thing about the

Electoral collage is that voters vote not for the president, but for a slate electors,who in turn elect the president. Peaple dissagre with the

Electoral collage do to the fact is is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take-all system in each state,canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. Those are mostly the main reason why the people do not want the

Ellectoal collage to continue they want to be the one who choose who is winning.

I agree with the

Electoral collage and think it should continue with it. I think the president and the congress ahould continue to decide who is the winner they got more expirience and know who will be the best person to continue with it and win the

I belive that the people of this nation should be able to vote for who they want to be president directly. So, I belive that we should disgaurd the old Eletoral College and switch it with election by popular vote. The reason why i would like to change it is becuse the people of this country should be able to choose their president, not a canidate to choose for them. I understand that it may be esair to have a select number of people choose the president. Rather than going to each stae and couting each of the indvidual votes, but this country is ran by the people and their dicisons on how to move foward. Chosing the right man to put in office is the first part in moving in that direction.

The  way that the Electoral vote is flawed is that the people don't get to directly choose thier president. The elected candiates  could go angainst the will of the people and vote for whom ever they please. Another way that it is flawed is that if the celcted candiates tie, the right to vote gets handed down to the house of representatives. The people have no say in this and the repersntives can vote for whom ever they please. This is a very unfair procses that the people have to grow through to choose the leader of thier country.

This prosess may esair but it is undemocratic. The people should have the right to directly choose thier president. The winner-take- all method is the wrong way to obatin electoral votes.

Instead of voting to choose electors to vote for the next president, popular votes seem more accurate , because it shows what president is more popular or wanted by the people.

To add on, electoral college votes not for the president, but for a slate of electors, states source 2. The electors are people not holding public office, which no one wants to vote for electors, the whole point is just to vote for the next president to serve and help maintain our country. Electoral College votes can be confusing also because voters may sometimes vote for the wrong canidate which is another problem if that person wasn't really voted for in the right mindset. To conclude, most people believe that electoral votes are unfair and in my opinion shouldn't be continued.

On the other hand, some people might agree to the idea of electoral college votes, it has certainty of outcome and sometimes the electoral college votes excede the popular votes , which gaurentee the win of the president elected. In toss-up states however, voters tend to pay more attention to the campaign and really listen to the competing canidates. So in toss-up states, thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election but electoral college votes don't necessarily let that happen. Lastly , electoral votes are kind of a good thing because it avoids the problem of elections where no canidate recieves a majority of the votes casted. With electoral votes, we avoid the problem of run-off elections and by doing so , the electoral votes help clear a winner.

In conclusion, the thought of electoral college votes all relys on someones opinion. If more people dislike the idea of the electoral college vote , then maybe it could be changed to popular vote only. In some peoples opinions, using electoral college votes are somewhat useless because most people who vote, their votes won't count , which makes the whole voting process pointless since everyone doesn't get a say in what president they should be able to have to help bring out and set forth their ideas. But popular vote allows that freedom of voting for the most wanted president, not the president picked only because electors wanted them.

saving paper is extremely important. paper comes from trees and many animals and wild life have homes in trees. with electoral college one wouldnt need paper to vote, which is a paper saver. the electoral college helps a lot when it comes to selecting electors,metting of the electors and where they wil vote for the president, and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. by saving gas one is saving money which can be used for any nessessitites.

gas now a days is extremely expensive,but with the electoral college one would be saving money because the electoral college is a process, not a place, and it doesnt require one to travel anywhere,whch saves gas and money. with the oney saved one can buy the nessessities that are needed. the electoral college offers a lot by just being a process. it helps save paper and money,whch is good for wild life and humans.

when it comes to methods for choosing the presisent and reasons to keep the method there isnt just 1, theres 5! the first method is that certainty of outcome.. it states that a dispute over the outcome of an elecotral college vote is possible and it happened in 2000,but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. a winning candidats share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. for example, in the elections that happened in 2012, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, b ecause almsot all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis,ev en a very slight. method number 2 is everyone's president. the electoral college requires a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal. no region(south,northeast,etc)has eneough electoral votes to elect a president. method 3 is swing states. the winner-take all method  of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election-to focus their campain efforts on the toss-up states. voters in toss-up states are more likely to poay more attention to the campain-to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are gouing to decide the election. method 4 is big states. the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population0 losy by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the consitutuion. mthod 5 is avoid run-off elections. the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.

8EEB5226121C,"Dear Mr. Rubio,

My name is PROPER_NAME and I am a concerned youth.

The electoral college system is archane, confusing and disruptive to the constitutional democratic republic that is the United States of America. Voters are thrown off by this system and are often completely over-looked in an election. For a country that was built on the ideals of freedom and fair representation, using the electoral college system isn't right.

Firstly, canidates running for president need a majority of 270 the 538 electors to win an election. Thus, they focus more on winning swing states such as Ohio, rather than winning the approval of their constituents. This immediatly shows faults of the electoral college. What kind of government is running the world's super-power? One that ignores its people and bombs governments of other countries for doing the same thing? The electoral college takes away from the value of the vote- a right for which the United States of America was founded. The electoral college may have had good and just intentions, but isn't effective or fair now. Also, with the embarrassingly low voter turnout the USA has already, having a confusing, old-fashioned and unfair system of electing leaders will only decrease the amount of citizens that actually go to the polls. Studies like the one published September 1st, 2012 by the American Research Institute, have shown that the average American person doesn't know very much about their country and how it works. Those that do are a minority. So, why would the government that is supposed to be looking out for, protecting and listening to its citizens still use a system that only deters already ignorant people from participating in elections?

Secondly, the electoral college (in addition to putting down the voter) has been proven to be faulty. Like the 2000 election with George W. Bush, with Clinton in 1992 and Nixon in 1968- these men all had less of the popular vote, but were president. How? How did they become the Leader of the Free World- the Free World that gives everyone the right to vote for their representitives- without the popular vote? Without the blessing of their constituents? How were these men sworn in without the backing of true democracy?

The electoral college.

This system goes against every democratic ideal in the United States' foundation! And yet, it is still how president after preseident is put into the Oval Office- sometimes wrongly as explained above.

The electoral college is wrong. It just is. There are no valid arguements for it. It puts down the voter and, in a sense, makes them obsolete which, in addition to being extremely hypocritical, is just not right .

Mr. Rubio, I am a citizen of this great country. I don't break the law, I don't burn flags, I love my nation and I care deeply for my fellow Americans. You are a United States Senator. Shouldn't you feel the same way? Help to abolish the electoral college. There are only benefits for the corrupt, not for the citizens.

Mr. Rubio, help to abolish the electoral college if you believe in a strong America.

I think the electoral college should be changed and people old enough to vote should be able to chhose who they want to be president. I think people should be able to choose who they want to be prsident because. And he start destroying the economy and he starts taking away things that some people need to survive or maintain.

One reason I think citizens should be able to choose who they want to be prsident because what if someone gets elected as president and for example he or she decides to begin a marshal law in the whole united states. Then he starts putting a chip in evevyones body and we get told when to eat and when not to eat. Then he or she starts to put us in concentration camps and we get paid 2 cents a hour and killed if we dont cooperate.

Another reason I think citizens should be able to choose who they want to be president is because. Its not fair to people cause that would be like a citizens vote doesnt even count and the government doesnt really care about what citizens think and they dont care about how we feel. Then if the wrong person gets elected and he or does something no one likes everybody gone be mad cause they didnt for that to happen.

Finally I think citizens should be able to vote for who they want to be president is because I honestly dont think the government doent care how anybody feel. And The Electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The electoral college method for selecting presidents may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no carrying their state.

the Office of the Federal Register , 1). The process of the Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, meeting  of the electors, and the coutning of Congress' electoral votes. The electoral College requires a majority vote of 270 to elect a President and your state is entitled to the allotment of electors. Even the Electoral College has a few flaws in its system, such as when voters vote in the election, they actually vote for the slate of electors, and ""the single best argument against the Electoral College is what we call the disaster factor.""(Plumer, 11).

The Electoral is critisized as a system that only seems to fit in the past and doesn't belong in the present, not democratic in a modern sense, the electors elect the president, not the people, even with the critisism it have recieved over the past years, it has stayed here and is still being used. ""There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic predigree; all are practial reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.""(Posner, 17). The certainty of Outcome, it's very unlikely to have a dispute over the popular vote. Because most states are award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the slightest plurality in a state can createa landslide electoral-vote victory in that state, there is a possiblity of a tie, but it is very unlikely. A presidential candidate is required to have a transregional appeal, no region has enought votes to elect a president themselves. A candidate is highly unlikely to become a sucessful president with only just a regional appeal, the candidate must have appeal to throughout the country to become everyone's president. Swing states have voters that are more likely to pay attention to the campaign and recieved the most attention from the candidates. ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" (22). The Electoral College reduces the pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.

""Under the Electoral College System, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who elect the president instead.""(Plumer, 10). The best arugment against the Electoral College is the Disaster Factor. The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the country but the system can allow for much worse to come. State legislatures are responsible for picking electors, and those electors can defy the will of the American people. In 1960, Lousiana's segregations almost succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new ones that would oppose John F. Kennedy, the candidate running for president at the time. There is always a chance of a state sending two slates of electors to Congress, it had happen in Hawaii in 1960. Vice President Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors. This can very well happen again. The Electoral College is unfair to voters, bexcause of the winner-take-all system in almost all states, the candidates don't spend much time on states that they knew they have no chance of succeeding.

""It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off  potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state- Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California, for example."" (23) Voters in presidential elections are people who don't think that a single vote can decide the swing of an election but they want to express a poltical reference. Even with its flaws of the Electoral College, the pros of it are just much greater and outweighs than the pros of going against the Electoral College.                                            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

It says ""the most thoughtful voters should be the once to decide the election"". Do you agree with this statement yes, or no?.

B7E9862AA0E0,"Dear Mr. Senator,

Over the course of American history the US has always had an Electoral College, which was designed for untrustworthy ballot counting during the 18th century. Today the world is in the 21st century and therefore the Electoral College is outdated on a several century basis. The Electoral College should be abolished because it is outdated and creates politicians that only care about the larger states. Even though America is a Republic the vast majority of people believe it is a Democracy, and that they elect the elected politicians as a people, but in truth elect people to elect politicians for them.

To commence, the Electoral College has no need for presense because it is simply outdated. The Electoral College was made for people to elect people to elect a president, which in its intirety is completly unfair, also it was made when a smaller population was present and the ballot counters where unreliable without the use of electronic counters. Now, one can argue that age has nothing to do with the election process because the close ties rarely happen- the most recent one in 2000 and before that 1888- but a close tie is not the reason. Today the world lives in a modern era where we know how many people voted for a specific candidate but still we use the electoral colleg to see who wins what state. For example, Al Gore, the presidential candidate in 2000, ""won the popular vote but lost the presidency""(9), now how is that fair? It is fair because of the Electoral College, where the popular vote isn't always the winner. Clearly, the Electoral College is outdated and should be abolished.

Furthermore, the Electoral College creates politicians that care not about the country but the large states, which have the most votes. A presidential canditate may forget about small states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina and focus on larger ones, like California or Texas, that foster larger amounts of votes. For example, ""during the 2000 election seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina""(13), but all the big states did. This is because politicians want to win and not focus on what needs to be done and only say what people want to hear. But once again there is always an argument; people can argue that the Electoral College wins by region, which explains why some states don't see the candidates, or that big sates allows for political balance. ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does""(21).

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be abolished because it is outdated and creates politicians that only care about the larger states. The US has outdated politics that have no need in todays society, why should the people depend on this outdated system? Also, the politicians only want to win the large states because of this system that does not always coincide with the popular vote. Overall, the Electoral College needs to be abolished.

But that is why you learn about your electors and who they want so you choose the one whon is going for you which is your president. Its as easy as doing a little research to find out who your really electing for as president of the U.S.

I believe that Us americans should keep the Electoral College so we can keep our rights as our nation for the people. That is what we fought for for our freedeom and our rights. So I argue Mr. Senator to favor in keeping the Electoral Collegeso we can get our electedpresidents for majority of people in the U.S. SO lets stay away from the presidents choice because that is not our rights we are the people for the people to vote for who we want as qualified citizens.

57807B412545,"There are alot reasons to keep our the despised method of choosing the President. The First reason is because Certainty of Outcome, in the text its states that ""The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Another example from the text is ""Obama, he recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.

Another reason is that the Electiral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal,in that case, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the South , has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state, he wont be able to campaign heavily. So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. In the text its states that ""It is a Desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.""

Also the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance the large states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment Senate decreed in the Constitution. My proof is in the text ""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama who won the that vote got 29 electoral votes. A same victory by the same margin in Wynoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.""So, other things equal, a large state gets more attention compared to a small state.

And Finally the Electoral College avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example ""Richard Nixon in '68 and Bill Clinton in '92 both had on 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the in the Electoral College.

Even though people think the ""Winner-take-all"" system is not fair i think it keeps everything in line. There are reasons why this system was created to prevent major problems from happening.

I think that it does not matter if Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the AFL-CIO all want to Abolish the electoral college. Sure over 60 percent of votes would prefer a direct electionto the type of elction that we have now  but I think it will just cause problmes. We would have to make new rules to when it comes to voting which could take a long time because we would have to have he approval of many people. Then everyone would have to learn these rules and the age to vote could be possibly changed. For everone to get used to these rules could cause many fights and arguements between peopl.

The Electoral College has been around since the Constitution of the United States of America was composed. Is it outdated? Probaly, however just because something is old does not mean that is doesn't work anymore. Why should be get rid of the electoral college? It is still working, and it is very effiecient at what it does. We must keep the Electoral college to keep the voting for the presidency under control.

The Electoral College is made up of 538 electors, so that means you need at least 270 electoral votes to win the Presidency. However, there is a very small chance that a tie will occur. In source two the author states that if there was a tie in the electoral votes, the election of the President would turn to the House of Representatives, and the Senate would vote for the vice-president. Each delegate would get one vote, so the state of Rhode Island would have just as much say as the state of Florida.

Since the popular vote does not decide the presidency, it is very possible that the electoral vote doesn't side with the popular majority vote. However that is very rare, and only happens maybe once a century. In source three the author stated that in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than George Bush, it was the first time since 1888 that the electoral college didn't side with the popular vote. It is very possible, but very unlikely.

There is no one region that has more electoral votes than the other, so no one region is suprieor to the rest of the regions. The candidates are required to travel to other regions, so all regions can see what the candidates campaign is, and see who the electors will be voting for.

If we did get rid of the Electoral college, there will be consequences. For example, in source three the author stated that only half of the population eligible to vote will even vote. Some people vote because they believe that they are the people who decide the presidency. The electors are people who want to express a political view point, than just vote just for the sake of voting.

Mr state senator, as you can see we must keep the Electoral college rather than switch to a popular vote for presidency. The Electoral College was created to last forever, and so far it is doing just that. If we get rid of the Electoral College, we will regret it.                                                                                     ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

These electors are just simply pledged to whom the voters vote for. The people have no control who their electors really vote for.

Now others like in our third source, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" written by  Richard A.

Can you really trust these electors? How do we know they will vote for the president the people really want? How do we know they won't ignore our votes? How can we trust these electors? Just like what Bradford Plumber said, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically resposible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.""

To some, the electoral college is unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state. Candidates usually only go to ""swing"" states. ""Swing"" sates are states with tight races. This, if fact, is not fair at all because some states don't even get to see the candidates. In our second source, it clearly states that in he 2000 campaigne, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all.

In the third source, it states, ""....Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaigne... They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters..."". I completely disagee with this because what mathematial, tangible, or hard core evidense is there to physically prove that the people in toss-up sates are more thoughful that the people who aren't. I think that candidates should go to states that have more people that are the opposite party.

Haven't you ever wondered why the poppular vote seems to have the majority of votes for a candidate? This due to the unfairness of the Electoral College. The Electoral College has to be eradicated mainly do to many factors such as the ""Disaster Factor,"" the Winner-Take-All"" system, and the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. These events can all cause a crisis in the country due the the Electoral Colleges unfairness.

One reason the the Electoral College can be considered unfair is due to something that we refer to as the ""disaster factor."" This is a possibility in which a state legislature is responsible for picking electors that vote based on their bias. This can be considered unfair mainly due to the fact that they did not follow their plegde to the citizens of their state. For Example, in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature choosed a group of electors in which the promised the people to vote for John F. Kennedy. In the end vote against Kennedy and not complying to their pledge. Luckily, Nixion, Kennedy's opponent, validated only his opponents electors, without establishing a precedent.

Not every one gets to vote.

Maybe if all people got to vote it will be better and will be ble to find out a better count because each state has so many  electoral votes. The thing I don't like is that not everyone has the right to vote and the should. It should be a freedom to vote after this is a free country. We also have the freedom of speech why can't we have a freedom to vote. I may understand that not all people are from this country but reall who is thatb is what make us different but, if we would understand it well be better for every to vote. That way it will be more fair than having only those that qulify.

Another thing is that when we vote the add up how mant people voted for this person and how many voted for the other and that n there they decided who won that state. add up the electoral vote but what happens to the other who wanted the other person they get pushed away and it should be like that. Those people should get a say in who the want too not automaticly be part of the one who won that state.

We should change the way we vote for our persident in the way it will become more equal and not asume it is right. To me the elctoral college just rounds up the vote in the state elector.

The Electoral College is outdated, and is commonly viewed as anachronism. In this system voters, instead of voting for a president, vote for a slate of electors. The slate of electors if chosen for the statewide election, would go to Congress. At Congress, they would then vote for the President. For many people, it seems understandably unfair.

First off, voters cannot control who their electors vote for. At this point in time, voters have no more of a say in which President is elected - they can only hope that the elected candidate shares the same views they do. Most of the times, this is the wrong case.

Second off, many times voters will get confused in who they're voting for. They'll pick out a candidate without knowing much information about them, or what their views are. A random candidate will be chosen for their vote, and most times this tends to come to an unhappy ending. Many times, voters will be disappointed and frustrated with how the election turns out.

People claim this tends to be due to the Electoral College.

It would, in terms, be much simpler to change the election to go by popular vote. This would have many benefits on the difficulty of the systems selecting a President, to how people react. By choosing a popular vote, time of the election would be cut slimmer. People wouldn't have to focus on choosing an elector, or their worries that their state electors didn't share their views. It would give our people the chance to vote for the President they want.

In the end, the Electoral College should be abolished and thrown out. It doesn't make sense to keep continuing on this way, when the votes should be up to the people - not random electors.                    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
B55DD4BF3B1B,"Mr Senator,

After being informed of the United State's combination othe the electoral college and election by popular vote, I was asked wether or not we should keep the electoral college or change the election to just a popular vote. I thought about this for a while and I believe the electoral college is beneficial to the results of the election.

We are Americans. We can be innovative and change the world but we can also be lazy and uneducated. While most Americans are informed about the election and who is running, Mickey Mouse is still the most popular write-in on the ballot. Why not have a group of citizens who represent our state and party have a say in who should be president? ""..each party slects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"" (Source 3). The electoral college is a group of sofisticated men and women who do this as their job. While the average American is tending to family, working or watching tv, their electors are learning the viewpoints of the presidential nominees and deciding wich one they think would be the best leader of our country. Why would it be anything but harmful to our country if we got rid of it?

I understand that you might be saying that voters don't vote for the president and electors overrule the popular vote. Electors are just an easier and more equal way of distributing the votes and electing a president. Only in rare cases has the electoral vote overruled the popular vote. Have you ever thought there might be a reason behind that though? Assuming the government isn't majorly corrupt and the elections are fixed, wouldnt you think that the slate you voted for should be trusted? Maybe they know something you don't or have witnessed the candidates actions in the past that could've swayed their vote. Citizens are keen but they do not know everything that goes on behind the scenes.

The Electoral College makes sure that there is a transregional appeal. Not one area can overrule the other votes. This is very important because it evens out the votes and reduces risks of a split country who doesn't want to follow a president elected by the South. Popular vote alone doesn't do this. If we just go by who was the most votes from citizens then If there is ever a great divide in which party want which president it could also lead to a divide in the country itsself. This could even lead to a civil war and make these 50 states not-so united. The fact that we have a system to keep order doesn't mean that we should get rid of it just because people want their write-in ballot of a cartoon character to mean more.

Keeping the Electoral College is necessary for the unity of our country. We should trust our slate of electors to vote the way we want them to. If they don't, the blame shouldn't automatically be put upon them. Since we elected the trustworthy slate, shouldn't we believe they have the best interest of the country and their party in mind? The Electoral College should stay as it is. This system keeps order, balances votes, and 99% of the time it works.

I fervently believe that we should abolish the Eletoral College sytem, and change the election of popular ovte because it is an injustice, outdated, and irrational.

The Electoral College system is highly unfair. The voters wnat to elect the president that they would like, and in order to do that their vote should be significant. Although  the Electoral Collge system is at times efficent, it still does not satisify the voters. The people aren't even the ones who get an actual say on who their next president will be. Even the people who are in defense of the Electoral College System agree, ""It is the electors who elect the president, not the people"" (15), says Richard A. Posner author of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing president."" In the 2000 elections, candidate Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush, and won the popular vote, but did not win the electoral college vote so he lost the presidency. If this is supposedly a ""free"" country with a democratic system, then shouldn't the citizens have the right to pick the individual that will be running their country for the next four years?

Some electors may not even vote with the majority. Voters can't control who their electors vote for. The electors are even sometimes picked by the presidential candidate running for office, how does it seem fair that a group of people that hold the fate of our country in their hands is chosen by soemone who would be highly affected by their decision.

It is also an injustce because of the way the votes count. If you live in a state with a higher population, your state gets more electoral votes. The amount of electors depends on the amount of senators and representatives your state has. There is one elector per representative, and two per senator. There is a total of 538 electors, and to win presidency the candidate mst have at least 270 or higher. For example sya you live in Iowa, where there are only four electors, the vote doesn't count as much as the votes in California or Florida.  The system is completely outdated too. The Electoral College system has been around for hundreds of yars,a dn it is not up to date with our modern times, so it is a complete waste to use it.                        ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

In few words, the United States should keep the Electoral Collage. Although the people may not depend on them, it does not mean that they are dependable either. The United States may have a long process of voting for a president for the country that in which only they can choose rather than the people, but it still is being done for the good of the countries' future.

The process for gaining a president may be long and not allow the peoples' voices to matter, but the future of the country cannot be placed on their unreliable descisions. Not all of the people are experienced on the ways of the government as the Electoral College or the House of Representatives are. In truth, you may never know that if a certified member of any one of the states is actually on the side for the greater good of the country. An enemy country may pay for any large number of citizens to elect a certain candidate that could be working for them. This could happen with the Electoral Collage. They may be paid by an organization working against the U.S. or by one of the candidates themselves for personal gain. But even if it did happen, as it claims in Source 1, by the Office of the Federal Registar, there would be the House of Representatives to also give the last vote if there were to be a tie. Source 3 states that there is an equal number of electors  which gives every state a chance of getting in the matter of equally electing a candidate for president.

Many things could happen while there is a new president to be elected. As I said before: the Electoral College may be paid to pick one candidate for president over the other. Source 2, by Bradford Plumer, states that the Electoral College has its defenses. Some of its members may be replaced in a state for that states' personal gain in the matter. Even so, it would be hard to tell. For the most part, it is the unfairness of not counting the peoples thoughts and opinions. It is their country as well!

All in all, it is very unreliable to put trust in the people, or anyone, for voting a president. Not many people may like the Electoral College, or their final descision, but even then it is the best way of getting a fair vote on a president. They will be there to select the new future of the country, besides being their job to do so, as opposed to the American people having duties elsewhere. They may want a candidate over the other, but even then by the end of the day, they would be in the same square they were on even before there was to be a new president elected. Even so, if there is a change in their style of living that they frown upon, they can always alert Congress.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
AAA152F374E0,"Today, there are many arguments between keeping our governments way of electing a new president. Many people have turned their back on the Electoral College saying that it is unfair and are instead for changing to election by popular vote. The Electoral College is seen as a non-democratic method of selecting a president that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes is the winner. Therefore it is the electors who elect the president, not us people. Some people even see the Electoral College as unfair. outdated, and irrational and see arguments against direct elections spurious. While some have different opinions saying that the Electoral College, although its lack of democratic pedigree, is very practical.

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required a elect a president. Your state's amount of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation. One for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. So, technically when you vote for your candidate you're actually voting for your candidate's electors. Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. All in all, it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.

Most states do award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, some things in a state could create a landslide electoral vote victory in that state. A tie is possible because the total number of votes is an even number, but is highly unlikely. In the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states that are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. Statistically, the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balnce that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionmen of the senate decrees in the constitution. So, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

The argument between keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote has many different sides to it. Through facts and opinions, there is many reasons our government should keep the Electoral College and some reasons that we should change to election by popular vote. In some ways the Electoral College can be unfair but in others it makes complete sense. The people who vote in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference not people who think that a single vote could decide an election.

I do not like the Electoral College. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It's basically a winner-take-all system in each state. Especially with California it represents 35 million voters and if they are really close and have a tight margin the winning side of the votes takes it all, which means all the 55 representative votes go for that one side. getting rid of it would be fantastic because we could have other options on having a better vote system that is more accurate and fair to the the people/voters.

First of all, an example of this could be Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. Like almost all cases award electoral votes on a winner-take-all, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. Thr popular vote was very close in Florida; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.

Secondly, this is not the greatest way to vote because first the voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, which in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for the slate of 34 Democratic electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president which wouldn't be what the voters want in some cases.

Third, according to the Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Next election the voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner couldagain lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. The Electoral college is not the best way to choose, it has minimum chances of succeeding in the future. I think a direct vote would work the best for the voters but yet the the electoral college has its cons.

Conclusively, the Electoral College is not the best way to vote. By a bare minimum margin of votes, it could cost the election for the other canidate. The bigger state could be a catastrophy and it would be unfair. Last, the Electoral College is irrational, outdated, and unfair for the most part with its winner-takes-all.

The Electoral College is a very contreversial topic when it comes to electing a president. Many people think it's a system that works fine, while others think it's a complete disaster. When it comes down to it, the Electoral College is a compromise between electing a president through congress and electing president by popular vote. In the past the Electoral College has caused problems in presidential elections and it can easily cause more problems that are much more severe than what we've seen in the past. America is all about democracy, so why don't the citizens get complete control by being able to elect their president directly?  It's about time that the government finds a system that works better and gets rid of the Electoral College once and for all.

The Elecotral College has many flaws, a major one being that voters don't actually vote for their president, they vote for electors, and the elctors are the ones who elect the president. You may ask yourself, ""What's wrong with this? One way or another we're still choosing the candidate we want."" While that is somewhat true, the system has many kinks that need to be fixed causing errors in the process. One example of this is the ""winner takes all"" rule.  An excerpt from ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" says ""... the electoral college is unfair to voters. Becuase of the winner take all system in each state, candidiates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"". At a basic level, this means candidates will only focus on some states, and giving up on others. In fact, the same article also says ""During the 2000 campaign 17 states didn't see the candidates at all..."" The facts prove it it, the Electoral College is a flawed, and unfair system, and it needs to be dealt with.

Another huge problem with the Electoral College is called ""the disaster factor"". According to Bradford Plumer, "" The American poeple should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse."" Plumer then explains how in Louisiana the legislature almost replaced the democratic candidates with some who opposed John F. Kennedy so that the popular vote wouldn't go to him, but rather someone else. This is a fine example of how corrupt this system can become if someone actually manages to pull something like this off. Other problems like a state sending two slates of electors to congress, or a tie in the electoral vote can happen, and there are some solutions to these problems, but why even go through them when a new system can be created  altogether?

People like Richard A. Posner argue that we should keep the Electoral college. Posner believes that the Electoral College balances the weight between big and small states. The Electoral College gives big states less electoral votes and smaller states more to balance things out. I don't see this as balancing anything. Now the smaller states have an advantage over the bigger states, so you still have the same problem you began with. Posner also argues that voters in toss up states are more likely to pay attention to campaigns, but Plumer clearly contradicts this in his article. He states ""  ... seventeen states didn't see the campaign at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad.""  The proof is irrefutable, the Electoral College has it's loop holes which seem fairly easy to get through. The system is outdated, it's time for a new system to take its spot.

I stand my ground when I say the Electoral College should ber abolished. The people should have full control over the election of our president, and even if that's not possible, the system is very corrupt. While some still agrue that the Electoral College is working fine, the proof shows it isn't. It either needs to be renewed or replaced altogether.

I believe that keeping the Electoral College is a good idea but I also think that changing to the popular vote is also a great idea.

I don't think we should change it to the popular vote because then it wouldn't be fair on the people thats running for president or electors, we also wouldn't be able to vote for everything all at once so it would make things very difficult.

The eletoral college consists of 538 electors. The majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. If we switched to the popular vote, it would be nothing like how the Electoral College works. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice pressident, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. I personally like the way the Electoral College is ran/worked and thats why I feel like its best to keep it the way it has been for many, many years.

If we are to switch to the popular vote, people would b fighting and arguing constantly, there would be no piece. I dont believe anybody would be happy because thats not a fair way to choose how our President, Vice president and the Representatives should be picked. We pick a new president every four years so why don't we just keep it the way it been for a long time so we don't mess everybody up on their decisions. Another reaosn why I don't care to switch is because what if we run into a run-off election. If we run into one of those it would be hard to get out of it just because we wouldn't know what to do. Popular vote would also run us into "" swing votes. "" If we were to get stuck in a swing vote, everybody would have to re vote and then pray it dosen't happen again.

Now that I have explained myself in much detail on why I think the Electoral College should stay the same, and why the Popular vote should be thrown in the garbage, please take what I said into concideration. I'm sure I could be wrong on a lot of things but I hope I got my point out and accros on why other people and myself think it should stay the same.

In source 2 the auther states that the voters vote not for the president,but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. The problem with that is that the electors  can be anyone who is not holding public office. When i vote i would like to know who i was voting for not letting electors vote for me then they would just be wasting their own time.''Inthe same vein ''faithless'' electors heve occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and a cast a diciding vot for whom ever they please. Plus that winnier take all thing i really dont like because i like other people to have a chance to see what they say.

Perhaps in source 1 they have a winner take all system that awards all electors to the winning presidental canidate. The electoral collage is a prosses not a place. It was established by the founding fathers in which they put it in the  constitustion as a compromise.

By the way in source 3 the auther states that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the popular vote. There are five reasons for retaining the electoral collage despite its lack of democratic pedigree all are practical reasons ,not liberal or conservative reasons. The first reason is certainy of outcome. the second one is everyone's presidents. the third one is swing states. the fourth one is the big states. the fifth one is avoid run off elections.

My name is Mikayla and I am very concerned about how my president should be elected for the United States. It would be nice to change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States , not keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is unfair and should not be used to elect the President of the United States.

The Electoral College has it's issues to why it shouldn't be used to elect the president of the United States. Well for one the Electoral College system ""voters vote not for the president , but for a state of electors , who in turn elect the president."" In paragraph 10, sentence 4 it states that electors ""sometimes"" get confused. Why is that you ask? well because the people are picking the wrong candidates.

The electoral college is also unfair to voters. I say this because of the winner take all system in each state. in paragraph 13 , In paragraph 2 it states that canididates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning , they focus only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Personally i wouldn't want to use something like that if its unfair , outdated , and irrational.

We should change the election to popular vote for The President. Why you ask? good question. Well because that way it can be fair and reasonable. And let's not forget the voters wouldn't get confused.

The electoral college should be abolished forever. We should continue from now on by changing to election by popular vote for the president. Popular vote would be fair and everyone would love it.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
42AB95516A2A,"Dear state senator, i just want to inform you on a few things about in favor of keeping the Electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think we as a natioin should keep the Electoral College. We should keep it because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed and because the electoral college requires a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal.

We should keep the Electoral College because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. It is entirely possible that the winner of eletoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000 when Gore had more  popular votes than bush. Yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region...south, northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is likely to be successful president.

Therefore us as a nation should keep the way we do things. We should keep the Eletororal College because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. Another thing is that the eletoral college requires a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal.                       ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Please take into consideration the following message.

I think that it would be better for our nation if the Electoral College was taken out of our system and instead let popular vote decide who wins. There are two main reasons I bring this argument to you. First, we pay taxes, we work hard, we put food on our tables, and we put a roof over our future voter's heads. We have absolutely no control of anything in this world. Letting us choose who gets to boss us around is something that we earned as US citizens. If you're going to kill us, atleast let us choose the weapon. Second, letting the popular votes decide who's president is a great way for all of us to get to know each other a little better, we may disagree but alteast that way we share our opinions and feelings and that is the foundation to a very happy nation and world.

D1AB51E5BDE3,"Dear State Senator,

Electoral Colleges have many resources on why they should still be in favor of keeping but I strongly disagree. Changing to election by popular votes for the president of the United States is way more resourceful because Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president of the United States and not all regions may have an opportunity to vote.

To begin with, Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president. Source 2 ""Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" states "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect for the president."" This quote shows that if you vote for a slate of Republicans or Democratic electorss pledged the president but those electors won the statewide election, those electors would have to go to Congress and the president would get the amount of electoral votes the people have made. It's a process having Electoral College systems therefore, it's much easier having popular votes for the president.

Furthermore, Source 3 ""Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" argues ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This quote is stating that not everyone has a saying on who they want their president to be. Like people in the South may have many elctoral votes but not other regions like Northeast etc. The entire community should be able vote, everyone should be able to vote. Electoral college systems shouldn't be able to reject no ones vote. Moreover, changing elections to popular votes is better because people have a chance to vote the president they want.

Electoral College systems may be in favor in many ways like the winner takes all method, or each candidate running for president having their own electors. In whatever case it may be it's not fair to people having their own votes being rejected. Like i said in my previous paragraph everyone should have a saying on whom they want their president to be.

In conclusion, I'm in favor of chaging the elections by popular votes for the preisdent of the United States because everyone has the saying on the president they wish to have. Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president of the United states and not all regions pf the United States have an opportunity to vote.

917F5CAE3BB5,"It has nearly been two centuries since our country was born from the ashes of a war far too long to remember every scar and wound, but we hold the memories of our promises in our Constitution and Bill. And since, we have upheld every right and every propesition with the upmost respect and worshipped it among our God. Or have we? Though The United States of America has proclaimed many good ideas and beings in our past for the future, it has not always been recognized. If uneducated, the regular unqualified citizen may not know that with our election system, we ourselves do not get to vote for which president we believe can take the reigns of our country, rather we vote for a certain amount of electors that make the decision FOR us. This is called The Electoral College Process.

Though this process does not run against the citizens, it does take away a direct vote to whom you desire in the presidential role. As a most obvious reason, people want to qualify themselves, choose a party, and do a lot of deep thinking not to hand the rights over to some higher-qualified politicist(s) that has just as much chance as the electors running against him but to make a decision based off of their own qualified knowledge from a viewpoint of regular Americans. Regular Americans, ranging from the small town  factory worker to a traveling military man. These are the citizens that run this country, the ones who know the real problems going on. Politics is only fortune to politicists; Politics is an opportunity for change to Us.

Now, what about the bigger states versus the smaller states? We all know that the larger the population in one state, the more representatives they have, and the smaller the population, well...they get the shorter end of the stick usually, especially in this case. When a tie occurs among the vote of electors, it is the House of Representatives' job to fix that and make a vote for themselves. This means that the slim few representatives representing thousands of people could make a vote; Although based off of political knowledge, it is once again stealing the popular vote from American citizens. And even compared to a larger state, less than a hundred individuals (all of which have done nothing but politics) are to make a decision for possibly millions of voters.

There is one turn that can happen at any given election and is most-likely our biggest worry because of such an open chance. Though it is said that there is highly rare chance in which a day would come in the election that a defiance might occur, it does not mean something so sinister as toying with the election system could not happen and with great costs. Considering it has already happened once when John F. Kennedy ran for presidency, how can we not assume it might not happen again? And even if such happenings may take decades to occur again, what of the electors that did not swear themselves to the vote they had claimed to have chosen in the first place? We, the People, elect Our representatives to uphold Our decisions in the party We choose, but what is trust in this country if we cannot even trust Our representatives to ""represent"" Our decisions.

In turn, the The United States of America has done their very best to make this country the best it can be, but this Electoral College Process has many disadvantages that takes away the rightful vote of American citizens. We are all human after all, ""professional"" politicists or not, we make mistakes and we are capable of deceitful things. The only difference is our trained knowledge and key advantages based on rank in the government system. Give Us the direct opportunity We deserve and break the Electoral College Process.            ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
725C2A19D865,"The Electoral College should remaining our countries voting system when deciding whom the president of the United States will be. The Electoral College is a process our founding fathers established as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote made by citizens (Source 1, paragraph 1). Citizens elect electors who will then elect the president. This system is affective in many ways and shall not be abolished. These electors are concious of every decision they make when deciding on our president and are here to look at things we may overlook. They are here to help us make the most affective decision. Afterall, this is an enormous decision. It is the decision of whom the president of our country will be.

The Electoral College has 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President (Source 1, paragraph 3). After the preisdential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment."" This lists the candidates whom ran for president in your state and the names of their respective electors. It is a well organized and thought-out process. This process helps us make the best decision as a country on whom our future president will be.

In source 2, paragraph 13, it states ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning in."" Candidates don't take their time in these states because they don't want their beliefs and ideas shut down. They spend some time in these states. The electors for each state help them vote wisely, therefore the absence of presence by these candidates should not be a big ordeal. People want to abolish the Electoral College due to citizens not being able to vote for the president yet they do not realize what this system has provided for us. It provides organization and avoids many, many problems that would likely take place without the Electoral College.

In source 3, paragraph 20, discusses how voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign due to the fact they have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates. These voters are the most thoughtful and should be the ones deciding the election. Also, in paragraph 22, (also in source 3) it states how there is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. That pressure is reduced by the Electoral College because it produces and reveals a clear winner.

The Electoral College was created many years ago and has brought organization to our voting system. Why should we try to fix something that is not broken? Changing the system would be illogical. Electors are wiser at making these final decisions than we are. Wwe deserve an input, which we can all agree we recieve, but we shouldn't make the final decisions of our country aimlessly. Electors are people who know exactly what to look for in a president and they are more knowledgable on the subject.

To start with, the election should be decided using popular voting because it would make the election process easier.  If one were to read the information of the electoral college he or she would become easily confused.  It would make more sense to just switch over to a popular voting rather than stick with the electoral college.  Its simple, if a candidate were to recieve more votes than his or her opponent he or she would win the election and become president.  Rather than now with the whole ""Voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" mess.  In the section ""What's wrong with the electoral college"" the text states that sometimes voters get confused about the electors and end up voting for the wrong candidate.  Clearly, it would be a lot easier to rid of the electoral college and instead adopt the idea of using popular voting.

We should adopt the popular voting when electing a president because it is what the citizens of said country prefer.  According to source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.  Is this country oblivious to the fact that they are forcing citizens to participate in voting in a way that they do not enjoy?  This country is supposed to give the citizens what they want, and are instead doing the opposite.  Citizens also would like to have the person who is in command of said country someone they like and or choose, not some other candidate choosen with the least amount of votes.  Do what the a majority of the citizens want instead of what the leaders of the country want. Obviously, we should abolish the electoral college and participate in popular voting because it is what the citizens of said country prefer.

In a nutshell, said country should adopt the popular voting method and abolish the electoral college method of voting because it is easier and it is what the citizens of that country prefer.

As you know America is very different from other countries. We are known as the land of the free, but then why cant we the people choose our president? The electoral college takes that right away from us. Americans have the right to vote so why would we be ignored and have our vote discarded. Many people dont agree with the electoral college system becase it strips people of their say and opinion in politics theres also the possibility of what people call a  diastor factor. Despite it not being the best way to choose a president there are some pros to using the electoral college system, for instance run-off elections, where the amount of popular votes are too close or when ""no candidate recieves a majority of votes cast"" sited from source 3 but then again thats very rare.

The electoral college has someone voting in our places. A state representative cant say yes to all the canidates so why are they choosing for us we know who we want in office we as americans have a voice and a say in who is our leader. The amount of votes depends on how many people live in each state but ""because each state casts only one vote,the single representative from wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, woud have as much say as the 55 representatives from california who represent 35 million voters"" as sited from source 2 with all representives choosing the same canidate how can you expect them to reflect the will of the people?

Disastor factors are the best argument againt the electoral college ""back in 1960 segragationists in the louisiana legislator nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john f kennedy (so that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy )"" thers also the fact that ""in the same vein and faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for whomever they please""as both sited from source 2 these disastor factors just prove how the electoral college can fail to choose a candidate fairly.

who are the electors ? and who picks out the electors ? it dependes on the state. voters sometimes vote for there electores but sometimes the voters get confused on who they voted on. somtimes the wrong candiate.

yes i do think that people who are running for president and senate should have the right to have a chance to become something big, but in my perspective i think that peoiple who is known and well common to there state will be a better outcome to whatever they run for. its like for an example, we live in the Florida state , we've know a woderful and handsome man that helps around our state and town of plant city,  giving us more and devoring most of his time helping the enviroment and creating a diffrence.

I comepletely agree with that statement. the Electorial colleges are not dermocratic at all and when you vote for a presidential canidate well you're actually voting for a slate of electors. the Electorial College is also an unfair way to determine our president because well each state has a different number of Electorial College votes. Each state should have an equal amount of Electors to make it at least somewhat fair; its still unfair because of the fact that they can always out vote the popular vote from the citizens. when the Electorial College decides to out vote the actual winner that becomes problematic to the citizens because now a canidate that the majority of America didnt want to become president is now president and that can be problematic because the people may become angry or upset in some way because a canidate they felt didnt stand for a good cause or that was unfit to run the country is now in charge. also like what is the point of letting the people vote for who they want to become president if their vote may not even matter or make a difference because the Electorial College is going to do what they want anyways.             ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
5B38B644790E,"Even though you may believe that keeping the electoral college is a great idea and a benefit to all, its not. Americans votes no longer count when having the electoral college and do not vare for our opinion on whom we believe should become our president, they decide in what they think is bvest for us. ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irtrational"". (Plumer, paragraph 14.) Most americns believe that the elcetoral college is unfair and voting has become a waste of their time and that there is no neeed to vote if their votes no longer count.

Our votes do not count and we are no longer in control. ""Most states have a winner take all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" (The Office Of The Florida Register, paragraph 7) Therefore no matter who wants what iif that is what the electoral college decides thats what goes, And many americans are getting tired of doing pointless voiting if it doesnt even matter. ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the house selection can hardly be excpected to reflect the will of the people."" (Plumer, paragraph 12) Yes, The electoral college might be voting for what they think is best for us, but whats best for us might not be want we want, it might not be what we think is best for us why does are vote no longer count? ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee - and that trust is rarely betrayed ... [; however,] is is entirely possible that the winner of the elctoral vote will not win the national popular vote"" ( Posner, paragraph 16)

Our votes are just a back up plan and we are not important. ""The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast."" (Posner, paragraph 22) If the eclectoral college leads to a tie our votes become the tie braker but that method has never been use so why are we even voting? "" It is the electors whyo elect the president, not the people."" (Posner, paragraph 15) Because the electoral college is voting for which ""package"" they think is best they believe that our opinions are unimportant and they know what is best beyond what we believe. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of elecetors, who in turn elect the president."" (Plumer, paragrph10) Our votes are just a second optiion and is not resonible and fair to each and every american who truly believe that they can make a diffrenece when they truly cant because they are an ""extra.""

All in all the electoral college should not be kept. Most americans now believe that we are not important and voting is just a waste of time which is currently true and fighting againt the truth is not going anywhere.

Hi, my name is Khalyl Silver. I'm fourthteen years old, living in a small town in Florida called Boynton Beach. I go to Boynton beach community high school and i'm a freshmen. The reason why i'm sending a letter to you is because on my writing test they were talking the electoral college. The question was should we keep the Electoral college or we should stick to voting for president. I'm with we should just stay voting for president. The reason i say that is because the Electoral college is that we should vote for the voters. But then they could be bad to choose. We all should have a say in voting. we shouldn't vote for the voters. We should vote for the president. As said in these passage i'm reading, it's says that (

under the Electoral college system vote not president, but for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president.)

I think we should do both, but the question is should we do Electoral college or we should stick to voting. Well we should stick to voting.

Every four years a new president is elected to run the United states of America. Which is caried out by a process called Electoral College Process. It is a meeting of various electors,in where they vote for President and Vice President. I firmly believe that this process should be abolished, and the President and Vice President should be chosen by popular votes.

For starters, the leader of the free world should be choosen directly by the American citizens. It must bruise like a birthday punch to know those who waited in lenghty lines for hours upon end, didn't obtain the President they bargined for because of electoral votes rather than popular. It is stated that ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now""

Source 2 Paragraph 9.

More than half of America's citizens would prefer direct election. So why aren't the officials giving America what they want? Possiblity to hold us captive in the ""free world"".

Another reason why the Electoral College process should be abolished, is the fact that we the people have to trust a complete stranger. Trusting a complete stranger with hands of your future is a difficult task to do. Seeing that most people in possession of power got there using propaganda. Posner believes that ""each party selcts a sdlate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...""

Source 3 Paragraph 16 . How is he completly sure about this? Hitler decieved his people and promised them ""better days"", and we all know how that went. The Elctoral College process is just not trustworthy.

All in all the Electoral College should be abolished and replaced with direct elections. This gives citizens more control over who they elect (which is supposed to happen in a Democracy). The people now freedom of choice, and the majority would be happy with the new leader of the free world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
AF1366A47AFE,"Dear Senator PROPER_NAME,

As you are well aware, elections in the United States are of extreme importance. Therefore, it is vital to have the best system possible when electing officials. Maintaining the current system of Electoral College would be a fatal mistake to our country. We must elect canidates by poular vote alone.

According to the articele

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Pulumer, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Beccause of the winner-take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" Americans who are voting the the next president should have the right to hear what canidates have to say. They may be the only one in their state who is not a democrat, but shouln't their vote still be heard.

The article also states that, ""Perhaps most morrying is the prospect of a tie in the elctoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the Houise of Representatives, where sate delegations vote on the president."" Shouldn't the American people get to decide who their president is?! We fought a war so that we would be able to govern ourselves. If the House of Representatives are allowed to choose our president, then why did why fight the war againg Great Britain? It isn't right.

Though the article

In Defense of the Electoral Collge: Five Reasons to keep our despised methos of choosing the President sates that ""it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not be the winner of the popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely."" The opposition even admits that the President may not be who the nation wants as their leader. That should never happen.

As you see Senator, Electoral College must be abolished by any means neccessary. To keep such an unjust system goes against the very principle the America was founded on. ""We the people..."" It was not ""We the government..."" or ""We the rulers..."". How can we claim to be a nation of liberty when the citizend are unable to determine who their president should be.

Sincerely,

632C8DA9E2B1,"Dear State Senator,

In my opinion, Im in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. At first I was all for keeping the Electoral College. But after reading the reasons why we shouldn't keep it I completly agree that we should change it.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight racs in the ""swing"" states."" So basically the electoral college doesn't give a fair chance to voters and that's not right. All voters in every state should get a fair chance. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!""

""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" Which once again is not fair and isn't right. If people are taking the time to vote then they're the ones who should be picking who the president is. Not the electors. ""When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.""

""The single best arguement against the electoral college is what we migh call the disaster factor. Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This is an example: ""In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.""

Those are a couple great reasons and examples why you should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States instead of keeping the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

BFA71BBF3536,"The electoral colleges shouldn't be taken away. Just because of its minnor flass it still should be keept because of the ""winner-take-all"" system it just awards electors to the winning presidential candidate. The out comes of the electoral colleges are almost certain and no hassels to figure out who won and who didn't. Also it is less likely for there to be a run-off election because of the balance in the electoral colleges.

But it just can't be perfect there also some deffects like when under the eloctoral colleges you don't voto for the president, but for a slate of electors which they vote for the president if the got the most votes. Also the electors can vote for whom they want so even if who you voted for got the most votes the elector might choose a different president. Ading to that there has been some errors like two slates of electors beingt sent to Congress.

There is also an oposite side to this and it is the people who don't want to vote under electoral colleges. Because they want themsels to choose the president but some times this also back fires because there is no controll over who they choose there can be a winning land slide or a tie then it will take way more time to choose who will be the president. Besides the majority of the population wants direct vote because they feel in comtrol of who will make it or not.                                             ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
52A324E8BDA8,"The people have a right to say what they want to happen in their community, state, and even as far as the country they live in. They should be able to decide whether they want a park built in their city or whether they want a specific up and coming President. Yes, popular vote at the moment seems favorable for the people, but it does not mean that the people don't vote in the the process of the Electoral College. They truly do vote for their president, just not in a way that they would like. Nonetheless, they do. That being said, the system of election should be kept to the Electoral College.

To begin with, the Electoral College, in a sense, is not democratic, as seen in modern times but it does not mean that it is not equal. Yes, they are voting for an elector in their state, trusting that they would vote for their chosen candidate. ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...,"" as shown by Richard A. Posner in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". This means that, even though the people are voting for an elector to pass on their message, they are still voting to make sure that the president they want to take the seat will get it. The electors so rarely betray the trust of the voters; it has happened one time in 2000, but again that was the first time since 1888. The most thoughtful voters will listen closely to the campaign, then choose which president they feel is fit. Which again, leads to the voters deciding, in the end. Furthermore, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states making it equal amongst those that have more population. For the most part, the Electoral College is equal.

However, others can argue against the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always,"" said Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong."" That being said, sure they can't control that but the elector rarely betrays the trust of the voters, only happening twice in recorded history. The Electoral College is still less likely to cause a problem than popular vote would. If popular vote were to play in hand as a system of choosing the president, then things outside of even politics such as, riots, would get out of hand. ""...in the Constitution as  comprimise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,""as said by the Office of the Federal Register in ""What Is the Electoral College?"" Either way, voters do get popular vote, and vote for their elector to vote for their chosen President. It is a balanced idea of both a government and citizen based vote for the leader of the country.

Overall, the Electoral College by far is a balanced system than popular vote is. It is fair, in the sense, that everybody gets a vote and in total, their votes go to what they think is best for their country. Which in turn, does allow for them to decide.                    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
F891A929A12D,"""it's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

(source 2 para. 14) But is it really? The Electoral College is why are nation is what it is. If we didn't have The Electoral College many of our great Presidents might not have been presidents. it's even under the 23rd amendment of the Constitution.

To begin with, their is a much less percentage of dispute between The Electoral College then their would be over the popular vote. for example, in 2012 election Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote and Romney recieved 51.3 percent of the popular vote. just imagine how differently our country would be if we had Romney as our president right now.

Also the Electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal, which means that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a President. in paragraph 22 it states the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balence that large states (population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the Constitution.

Even though the Electoral College is amazing and revolutionised The United States, ""under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of selectors, who in turn could elect the President."" (paragragh 10) so if you wanted to vote for Kerry you would have to vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry.

in conclusion, The Electoral College is a revolutionary thing that was created by the founding fathers and put into the constitution as the 23rd amendment. it is a easy process that has made the United States what it is today. some of our very own Presidents have won because of the Electoral college.                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

But did you ever figure to you that if you go to class for one day, it could reflect. How? well just think this, deciding wether or not you want to skip class or go to class, the day in class is like a year in college and a year of not going to school, could be a day in jail. so think about it, do you want to stay in class or do you want to stay in a cell, well that's your choice on wether you want to choose a good one or not.

It is time we change things and move to a election by popular vote.

The electoral college was founded many years ago by The Founding Fathers. It was a compromise between the election of our President. It selected electors thats would put the vote in after we voted. It was a great idea back then... I think it is time we change this and let the people vote. We cann't use the same ways as time moves on. This should be an election for the people.

In the electoral voters don't even vote for the president. They vote for than elector. This could very well be anyone holding public office. People sometimes get confused and vote for the wrong candiddate. Back in 1960 louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing all demoratic electors with ones that oppose John F. Kennedy. Somestimes faithless electors have refused to vote for their party. This is outrageous! What is this happens again. With the time and place we are at now these things should not be happening.

Futhermore, the people should elect who becomes OUR president. We are the that have to live with this president. Another reason is because its unfair to voters, the winner-takes-all system shows that caue candidates don't spend time in states they know wont will. And if the electoral college gets a tie it would be horrifying. Leaving it up to the House of Representatives.

All of this is to show that electoral college should be Abolished. This is outdated, unfair, and irrational use. Putting our faith in people we don't know has caused problems.        ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
