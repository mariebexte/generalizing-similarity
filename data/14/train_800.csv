I believe it would be a great idea to require all students to perform community service, doing this would cause our community and the world to be a better place.

For example, if just a mere 25 students would help pick up trash around SCHOOL_NAME everyday, our community would be so much cleaner.

And, if our community is that much cleaner, the more likely less birds would tragically die due to mistakenly eaten trash, and less sea life would die from being suffocated from plastic bags and six pack can holders.

If older or more educated students were willing to tutor, or mentor younger or less educated students, then our school and community might all just be a bit smarter.

In this case, it would help out the teachers as well as the parents. Not everyone can necessarily afford a Math, English, History, or Science tutor.

So, if a more educated student is willing to help out that could keep from kids failing tests, not turning in homework, and maybe even passing a class.

If more SCHOOL_NAME students helped feed homeless families, build houses in Mexico, or maybe even just read a book to a younger child who can't read, this community would be better!

Some people need food, some need a place to live, and some might just want a story read to them.

But all of this is counted as community service.

ALL of it helps our community, and makes it a better place.

In conclusion, if you require all students that attend SCHOOL_NAME to perform a certain number of community service hours, our community WILL be a better place. I can promise that.

Community service is a very important thing, it helps the community and can even change the world. Simply one person can make a HUGE difference on this planet.

Imagine how big of a difference 1,300 students can make.

I think students should have to do community service because if they want the points to go to the next grade or school they need to do community service. For me community service is a good way to show kids how to work. I think the required time for community service is twenty-four hours. I think that community service can be done anywhere even in fast food restaurants such as Burger King, McDonald's, Wendy's, or KFC, and all the other fat food restaurants, but the point is not about fast food restaurants, the point is that i think that community service could be done anywhere if they let you. If you want kids to have to do community service then they should do it and if they don't want to then that's their problem because they have to earn the hours and the points, and if you don't want to make us take community service then we have to make up for it in high school. I have not yet done my community service because i haven't had time to do it but i am planning to do it in these next few months, but my problem is that i don't know what i should do to gain the points. I was thinking i should do my community service, and get the required points at .... well like i said i don't really know where i am going to do it, but ill think about it really hard, but my goal is when i do find out what i am going to do i am going to get the points and hours in a week and a half or less.

with picking up trash around the community, it would look more appropriate and would be great to keep Earth greener. maybe , if people see us caring about Earth, they would want to help out also. if we all make sure crime or gangs be eliminated in neighborhood's, there will be less things happening.

Dear principle, TEACHER_NAME

I believe helping our community is a big responsibility. We are giving a big part to help out. We should all be required to help out. Just like we have time to lay back watch tv we should have time to help others. Plus watching tv is not even helping us were just ruining our eye vision. We can pick up litter its simple as 1,2,3. Yeah okay were teens maybe some of us are embarrassed to do that. But there's other things we can do. We can sign up for programs, tutor, help out in a library, volunteer. Were not only helping others we helping ourselves too by getting recognized and on the other hand were not sitting in the couch all day long were even sometimes getting some physical done. Community service might take some time of your schedule but it isn't required to do 24/7, you can actually choose the day you would like to perform. This is a great opportunity to get to make friends too. Community service is a great benefit look at the positive side not just the negative. And if there is a negative I bet you, you can find a solution. Its time to take action.

Some students are taking community service and some are not.

I think we should all help in cleaning our environment.

Without this beautiful environment we would not be speaking today.

We would not enjoy having games and friends to play with.

We should all have at least 30 min each day going around recycling, or throwing away trash.

There are people who would not like this idea, but it is best we do this for our community.

If we keep this up not picking up or doing anything to help the earth.

This whole earth will be in trash and more people will die from an increased chance to get a dieses.

If we were just to throw our plastics on the ground, birds or rabbits will eat it then they will choke and die while we watch and do nothing about it.

There has been more than 1 million birds die and I don't want to sit here watching.

Many people will volunteer, others will be forced to but if were going to change the earth we better do it know.

People want to learn and work in a clean environment.

They don't want food that has a piece of plastic or mud on it.

We need clean place to study, live, and enjoy life.

There have been more than 250 bottles under the bleachers at the football field.

If we could pick that up and recycle we saved at the earth that much more.

I suggest we have a group that does community service.

We will have shifts like group 1, group 2, group 3, etc.

We will change the earth as much as we can.

2A43B5C34CD0,"The schools activities are decided on if the students are doing the right behaviors or goals. The students actions can reflect on if they need community services. On the other hand if the students volunteer to do community service than they should let the staff decide if they deserve it or not if not, than the students or staff should just find something else to do. The staff decides to agree to the students requests, but they should organize in advance if not than the activity will be a bad experience.

The students would probably not like to do something like that again. Also the staff would be less ecstatic about trips these are some down sides. If the trip or service is a success than the company might want the school to come back in the future. The students would be glad that they get to get out of school for a while. The staff would be glad for the kids not getting on their nerves all day.

All activities be would fun for a group of students would enjoy the experience of a trip. The staff I don't know about, but they might as well.

I believe it should be required to perform community service. Performing community service brings many new advantages and perspectives to students. Students are also allowed to volunteer for a service program which they will enjoy. The experience provided through the volunteer work gives students new ideas and new insights on future jobs or even majors in college through experiences which will help students define their comfort zones in different working environments. I also assume that everyone should take their time to help the community.

Students have the advantage of choosing the service they may volunteer for. Most students volunteer in an environment they find safe and comfortable. An athletic student may volunteer to help coach children who play sports. Whilst a student who enjoys literature may volunteer at a library. Another student who enjoys working with children may volunteer at a daycare. There are wide ranges of programs available to suit each and every student's preference. Some students who do not enjoy their work may grow interested while working and decide to expand their knowledge for future reference.

The main idea behind community service is not to keep students busy but to introduce then to new working environments which may influence their decisions on job options or college majors and degrees. An intellectual student who is also known to be shy may find pleasure in working around people in nursing homes or other crowded environments. Community service allows students to expand their views on jobs of the community. I believe it should be required for all students to perform community service.

It can prevent others from getting all kinds of sickness, and all so it can be a better place for every human on earth.

We can prove to other people that community service doesn't take a lot of time. They can try something short of time but they can still help out some way. There is a lot of other kinds of community services that don't take a lot of time but still they can be fun. One of them can be planting trees, flowers, anything you would like to plant and it can take about 10 to 20 minutes and you still can have lots fun doing it. Once you start you'll be liking it and be wanting to join other activities. Its fun you can just find something you like and you'll enjoy doing it.

You can try asking them to see what they like to do or what they do best , once you know what they like to do you can find different community services they can enjoy and at the same time having fun doing it. If people think they don't have time or that it takes a lot of there time, you can try showing them short but fun activities that they can enjoy. Instead of them being stuck at home watching TV the can try and go do some other activities that they know they will like and enjoy doing them.

If there good doing sports, they can teach young ones how to play. these can be some of the community services that they can try out and see if they like them cooking , planting, like animals, help old people ,like to cure animals that have been hurt, helping old people getting there groceries, there is a variety of stuff they can try and then see if they like it. if they like any one these or different one they can try doing it once in a while and they can get use to doing it and they can have fun doing them. And it can help us do a better life for little ones when they get big they wont have the variety of sickness that we have. It can be a better world for us and for all. we can try cleaning up litter it can prevent all this damage we are doing to are world and buy helping with no littering it can be the best for us and for all.

My name is STUDENT_NAME. Some of my friends do community service like tutoring younger children or cleaning up litter in parks. Others do not want to do community service because they feel it takes up too much of their free time to do other things. I on the other hand disagree with them. I'm sure you disagree also. I feel we should have students be required to perform community service as a requirement to graduate from high school. I think this because for one thing it would help out our community a lot and we would feel good about ourselves when we know we did a good thing.

I understand why some kids would not want to do community service because they may want to have fun doing other things with their friends or have a busy life. But that is no reason to not help out the community for one day! Lets say a group of kids wants to go to the park and play. When they get there the ground is covered in litter, so they leave and have nothing else to do. That is why we need to have students be required to do community service, so we will have clean parks to play in.

If every student in high school just volunteered for one weekend of community service the whole town and the citizens living in it would have a much better life. The citizens would have cleaner fairgrounds, nicer roads and sidewalks, and their sons and daughters would be more educated, if the students tutored them! The students would only have to do that much for the requirement, but they could do more if they would like.

In conclusion I think you should have community service be a requirement for all high school students for them to be able to graduate! I think this because it would make our community a safer, happier, and cleaner place to live in! I hope you take that into consideration.

I believe that all students should be required to do community service considering that it helps your community and your chances of getting into college. Community service could be as simple and fast as helping clean trash and it helps you because when you try to get into college they like to see community service on your application. When you do community service you help your environment and the people around you because you are taking the first step to helping your city.

I also think community service should be required because most students are lazy and like to sit around all day. But if community service was required it would also get kids moving and exercising and that would also be helping the overweight problem. The least us kids could do is give back to the community and that's why i believe community service should be required.

DF564C30E155,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that community service is a great requirement to obtain with the students. There are a majority of students that believe that this is a reasonable decision, however, there are some students that think that it is an irrational decision.

From my perspective, I would do the work because despite the fact that I play a lot of basketball and volleyball leagues at once, even I can fit in some community service. I don't believe that it is a matter of being able to fit it into your schedule, but a matter of being motivated to participate in these events. In the past I have taken part in some community service activities, when I reflect on those memories I have come to realize why some young adults as well as children do not like them. This is because there are two different types of community service events. One's that you can take part in and enjoy and ones that are boring that you have to put up with anyway. These can be fit into categories for different people interests.

Another variable is the benefit of participating in these events. Sometimes if there is no positive end result applying to themselves or benefit of participating in these events than children will prevent any way to help. If we can some how create realization and open peoples eyes to the opportunities that are right in front of them than that will reduce the population of children preventing the work. The benefit can be a prise or maybe just make them conceive and hopefully treasure how they've contributed to helping a cause or what ever the situation may be.

If you can identify the type of kid that you are dealing with than I believe that community service will be much easier to with hold within ours and many other school districts. If we can start by sacrificing time to help out than we can influence other districts and hopefully it will spread like a wild fire and create a community of children helping. With many children taking part, this may become a volunteer choice for many children or just make it an easier experience for them to acknowledge.

I think that you should not require all students to participate in community service because that isn't fair to the children. It's already bad enough we have to go to school for 7 hours! Also, if children want to perform in doing community service, I think you should give them high school credits because they are doing something for the community and they deserve it for volunteering! Many kids have to do other things after school and community service is definitely not one of them. As a student, I don't agree with your suggestion and I strongly suggest you not pass that as a rule to all children because students have to do other things. For example: homework, hang out with friends, spend time with the family, etc. I know i have a busy life and I would absolutely HATE the idea of you even thinking about changing that to something a child has to do. We deserve to have the right to choose if we would like to participate in helping our community. For example, you should have us, students, vote on if we would like that or not and the people who did vote yes then they should be getting something (like a high school credit ) for there volunteering and helping our world become a better place. But for the children who don't agree, they shouldn't be forced to be performing in community service. As the principal you are, you should do the honor of letting the kids choose this time.

I think students should do community service it will help are town and keep it clean.

A lot of kids think its a waste of time but really when you are all done you will be proud of your self. Nothing else its bad when you see someone drop there trash on the ground some people see other people do it and don't say anything. I pick up trash when i see it. When i go to the beach there's so much trash on the ground and know what i pick it up and throw it way.

There's no reason why you cant walk to a trash can and just throw it away. Its not that hard you know. It would be cool at are school at lunch if everybody threw there trash away and the teachers at are lunch wouldn't yell at us. Its so much easer to just do it first than doing it a second time when you first didn't throw it away and then the teacher is making you pick up 10 pieces of trash. There's kids at are school who get in trouble and there the ones that have to pick up the trash and roll a trash can with them and pick up trash the whole time at lunch. I think that's such a great idea.

I think everybody should do community service in Palm Desert. It will make are town so much cleaner and look so much better for people who come from other places and see are town they would be like wow look at this beautiful town. Because know what there wont be trash on the ground. I think people should go to the high way and pick up the trash because that's where everybody throws trash. People just throw it out there window like there personal trash can. People just don't care anymore. People are getting so lazy. I think people should start caring than not caring about earth.

Students should have to do community service like pick up liter. Many students may think it is a waste of time but it is actually helping the environment. By helping the environment, they are really doing more then they think. Many things can be hurt if there is liter everywhere. By helping the environment there can be more then they expected.

All of the students should have to do community service and pick up liter. By picking up liter, students could take another turn and do lots more to help the environment. When the pick up trash off the road, ground, and anywhere, students can get a sense of maturity.

I believe that all students should be required to perform community service. Why? Well, when you perform community service, many things may come out of your experience. Community service should be required because: 1) it's not a hard thing to do, 2) they get a good feeling out of knowing that they helped, and 3) it is their community.

Nowadays, teens are so busy, whether it's because of sports or plans with friends, they don't realize that the world is in such bad condition. Community service can be taken as a waste of time or an activity that's not so hard to do. Whether it's cleaning up the local park or participating in a town activity, they can find the time to do it. Think of when they have nothing to do, instead of playing video games or watching television, they could be doing something that will be benefiting them now and later on.

Community service is a great way of giving back, and there are so many things that they can do to help. They can participate in a blood drive, do a town wide cleanup, or help collect money to donate to their town's charities. But after all the work is done, they get the best feeling knowing that they have helped. Most teens my age are very self-centered. They go to the mall and think that community work is just done for them. But, if you require for them to do community service, you could be helping them realize it's not all about them and giving back is something great and they should be doing it more often.

Students shouldn't feel like they have to help out, they should feel obligated to. After all, it's their community. The idea that they have to help out because they are being forced to is not how they should feel. I think that by requiring that all the students participate in community service will help them realize that there's a lot of work to be done and the community can benefit from their help. It's their responsibility that the community they live in is in the best shape that i can be.

So, like I said; I believe that requiring that students perform community service is important because: 1) it's an easy thing to do, 2) they can get that proud feeling knowing that they've helped in some way, and 3) it's their community - they should feel obligated to help out. Please put this into consideration. Imagine who and what you'll help by pushing your students do better.

Helping out the community is always a good thing to do.

Some people like helping, but others don't. I understand that people are busy with other things and might not have time to help the community, but little things you do help.

Therefore, i think that the students should perform community service.

If you have something else going on like sports for example, you could take a day off from them to help the community. Some people don't even play sports because they can't afford it, so think how they feel. If the students helped out the community, i think the community would appreciate it, and be thankful that the kids took time out of their schedule to help them.

Community service doesn't take long, the longest it would take is a day. After you do community service you feel good because you know you helped people.

Even if theirs certain things you don't like doing for community service, there's many things that you could choose from.

I know i would feel good if people helped me out, and the people you are helping will feel good too. As a principal you should encourage the kids to do community service. It will help them become better people. I mean i know, I'm a kid and i know doing community service isn't the most fun thing. I could be doing something better. No one likes doing service.

After you get done with it, you do feel good inside and you know that you helped people have a better life. There's always little things that you could do to help out in the community. Even recycling. You help out the community a lot doing that because you are cleaning our world. People should recycle more often and it would make our place cleaner and healthier to live in. We do community service in my school. We do it every year as a class. I think that even one day a year helps people out a lot. I would say that you should have your students do community service.

We should not be required to do community service hours.

If kids do not want to do them then that is okay, but if they want to or need them for something else you should provide them the opportunity.

You could ask the local community if there is anything that they need help with and then they could work on picking up litter or something.

You could have us sign up to do the hours, but if we don't want to then we don't have to.

You could also have some kind of reward for doing service hours like an ice cream party, or pizza party.

You could have them go on a field trip somewhere if they do the hours. You could also have the kids decide on a relatively low budget idea.

Also instead of giving out detentions you could make that student do 30 minuets of community work. I think most of everyone would agree with my opinion because if people do the community work anyways and they have a low grade score, then this could really help the student and your schools reputation as a whole.

I just heard that you are trying to decide on a very big topic. I thought i would wright you a letter to let you know what I think. I fell that you should require every student to do some sort of community service. There are two simple reasons why I think that you should require community service. My first reason is that it teaches the kids good live lessons, and the second reason is that will make other schools maybe try it to.

Community service can teach life lessons. Some kids look at community service as a bad thing. When you think of community service most people would think of picking up trash. Say a student hated picking up trash but for community service made him pick up trash. He would learn form this to mot litter because there are people that go around and pick up trash and now he know what it is like. Another example is say a student helping out at a nursing-home. this student could of not like to be around old people. now he would be able to see that the elders are not that bad.

My second and last reason is that maybe other schools will see what we are doing and they would try it. Can you just think of another school likening the idea you had of making kids do community service. You could inspire other schools to help make their community's a better place.

21A24A785A7E,"I strongly believe that it is important for students to do community service. I will be telling you why I believe this throughout my essay. First of all, i will explain why I agree with this topic. Second of all, I will tell you why it is important for them to volunteer. as you continue reading my essay you will find more details about why I agree.

To begin with, i agree with this topic because most kids are lazy. Volunteering will help them overcome that laziness. If students volunteer just once because they have to and they end up enjoying it then they will end up doing it a lot. It is good for a kid to volunteer because they will feel good about them selves if they know they did something good. This is why i agree with this topic.

Secondly, It is important for kids all ages to volunteer. for example, when you're applying for a college most of them look into if you volunteer. also, if you volunteer you will feel like you did something good for the community. if you volunteer you most likely be rewarded which a lot of people enjoy. these are a few reasons why i think it is important for kids to volunteer.

In conclusion, I agree with this topic and I think it is important to volunteer. So i hope that by reading my essay many kids will be voluntee                        ",3,Community service,Independent

I think they shouldn't be required to do community service because, it might take up their time to hang out with friends, to do their homework, or to do extra circular activities in school. If they are forced to do community service they might be mean to the people they are helping or they could do a lousy job. If they were walking around town picking up litter they could not pick some up or they could be eating or drinking something and throw it on the ground and be making it worse than making it better. They could be toutering elementary children and be mean to them or they could be giving them the wrong answers because they don't know what it is that they are doing. If they are doing community service that they are forced to do they might not have enough time to finish their homework and fail the paper. If that happened they wouldn't be able to participate in any extra circular activities. If they are forced to do community service they might think about dropping out of school or getting home schooled More people would want to community service if they get paid, but i know that won't happen!!!

93106B20FE87,"dear principal, i believe that the students of this school should be required to do community service. i believe so because even if they don't want to they should still have to. doing community service helps learn about the responsibilities of being an adult. it does this by teaching them that you don't always need to get something in return for what you do. it also can help build self-esteem, because it makes you feel good about helping your town and the people in it. it also allows you to pass high school because there is a required amount of hours of community service to graduate from high school. that is important because if you don't graduate from high school you will never be able to go to college and you won't get a good job to support you and a family. that is why i believe you should be required to perform community service.",2,Community service,Independent

I am writing to you to inform you of what i think of community service. Some kid's in our schools think it is boring and waste's time on what they need to do. Others think it should be used for disapline. I agree that we should use it for kids that act up or have detention because they would have to clean for what they did and it wont waste's the teachers time. The reason they should do this is because they wasted their time fooling around in class so now they have to make up that time by doing the service. Another reason why they should do this is because the world is filthy enough that we cant have that no more so what they can do is clean the public park of all its trash .There is a lot of different needs to be done all around the schools and maybe they can do some of that. Their might also be stuff in school to do so they can do that to. If this works maybe the kids in the schools might not act up and pay attention in class.

I believe we should help are community, why? because for many colleges it requires that a student has help their community. A good reason why its a good idea to help is taking care of our community will not only help with working together but making people happy as well. A good idea for who are against you should have a contest for each class. Who ever has helped the most, that class would get a special prize like a free trip for each student family and teacher. This would encourage students because most students like rewards for their hard work.

Another reason why helping people around our community will be good is it will let out our school be noticed. Parents would be proud of their kids and people in are community would be honored to have a school like ours in the community. A environment like that would wonderful for our school. It could also lead to more students joining the school too.

When we help people, in return they help back. Just helping people could also lead to more wonderful things. Helping people who are sick or who need help getting around will give a good positive feeling. It can be recognize by people that we could get a free field trip to somewhere amazing and fun for all the students hard work. Also cleaning up little for are community would are community gorgeous and not disgusting and dirty.

25E486CDCCBB,"Students should have the right whether or not to do community service. In my opinion i feel that doing community service is a good way to help out your community. Doing community service allows students to be involve in what happens in the world and in there community also. Community service helps you do good things for your community, stay active, and helps earn credit for doing community service.

First, community service is a good way to help out your community. Its good because your helping your community out by picking up trash that just lays around outside or even helping out on events that take place in your community. Many citizens would appreciate that you are taking action and being responsible in helping your community. Volunteering at events is good for your community cause it allows you to interact with different people and its a good cause.

Next, doing community service helps you stay active by moving around and doing something. Many students just sit home and do nothing, while do that when you can be outside doing something good for your community and environment. Stay active is a very good way to be healthy and you can do that by doing community service help out. You can also do community service with your friends too!! Having fun with your friends while doing community service is also a good way to stay active, you can help clean or have a community dance class, something that is fun and active.

Many people may disagree with me and say that community service is boring and picking up trash is gross but, you can have fun doing community service. Staying fit and active, helping out others with needs and much more. Helping out the community is a opportunity to help out your environment and help others too. Picking up trash isn't the best but you can have a game with it like, whoever picks up the most trash wins like 10 bucks or something fun.

Helping out the community is a good way to help the environment and other needs. Community service is a good thing and more students should be involve with it. Whether its just by helping an elder walk across the street or maybe just picking up a piece of trash on the sidewalk. Start by helping out with the community and you can start today!!

I don't think that you should require every student to do community service.

I think this because everybody should be able to do what they want.

They could volunteer to do it, but you shouldn't make them do it.

It would be a good idea to start a little club or something of that sort to do community service.

Or you could put up a list in the office or right outside of the office for people to participate in doing community service.

I don't think everybody should have to do it cause when they are not in school some have things to do like sports and other sorts of clubs.

You could also get a class that people could be in to do community service as a class so people could put on job applications and college applications too.

A class would also be good for tutoring the elementary, so they wouldn't have to stay after school.

Most student probably wouldn't be able to do that.",2,Community service,Independent

Serving our community can be very beneficial in a variety of reasons. Not only should students be required to perform community service, but a number of hours should be required as well. It can be so life-changing to those that have never done it before and can really help out the community that we are living in.

Community service is not only important in all communities, but it can be the difference between a clean, put together community, or one that could be known to outsiders as a ""dump."" Without those who help out in their free time, communities all over can start to look really sloppy. When students are required to give some of their time up on a weekend or in the free-time after school, it can change their mind. At first they may just be hesitant but after they get out there and help the community out it can really change someone's thoughts about the subject. This could then lead to a chain reaction of teens helping out, when one friend tells another, who tells another, and so on!

I have done a number of community service project with my church, family, and friends, it makes me feel so great when I am helping out others and my community! It would be such a blessing if other's would enjoy this feeling too. While picking up trash on the side of the road may not be someone's idea of serving their community, there are so many more ways that they can help out. From cleaning the pine straw off your neighbors roof to spending a summer morning at the beach, Community service is such a great way to get involved.

While some people may think that community service is a waste of time, they should know that it really helps people out. Say our school volunteered to deliver meals to people that don't have very much, I know from experience that those people are so thankful that a teenager would take time out of their social life to help others out. At first, I was nervous to go to people's home that I had never met before and deliver meals, but it is so rewarding to see their smiling faces whenever you knock on the door and say ""Meals on Wheels."" As well as being nervous, it can be quite scary, picking up trash on the side of the road it overwhelming when large trucks and cars are passing by very quickly, but when you ride by the spot where you picked up trash, it makes you fell so good knowing that you did that.

Community service is such a great opportunity to get involved, whether it's cleaning out cages at the local animal shelter or rebuilding swing-sets at the park, everyone should be involved. It is such an amazing experience, once someone does it, hopefully they will enjoy it and keep doing more and more!",5,Community service,Independent

Community service is a great help to our society and not enough people do it. Some people think that community service takes up to much time in the day so they might not be able to do more fun things such as play sports or associate with friends. Although this may be true, community service is an ecstatic deed that everyone can do to serve our community. All in all, our school should be required to have our students do community service, and here's why.

Community service includes things such as helping the elderly, tutoring children, and even picking up litter. These may sound like tedious deeds, but where would the world be without people doing these things? We would all be rolling around in our own filth and our education would suffer from lack of mentors. Although they may be a pain to do, our school needs to try our hardest to get it done for our community.

Studies show that only 24% of people who know what community service is have actually performed an act of it. That leaves 76% of people who have not. Eventually, those numbers will come back to haunt us unless we do something about it. What we need to do is make our students perform community service. It doesn't have to be a lot, but something as simple as picking up trash around the campus or even helping a younger child get an A on a test. Whatever the deed may be, it will be helpful.

Another reason our school should make it mandatory to perform community service is that not enough students exercise. This may sound very cliche, but community service can also be a part of a physical education class, that way they are helping their community and they are benefiting from exercise. If we are to do this, it should not be a semester long thing, but maybe a week long unit of all the students chipping in to help better their community. And maybe our school could also start a club or group for the children who want to continue to better their community. Not only that, but it would also count as an extracurricular activity, which would help students in college and beyond.

If our school were to form a club or group for this, then many students would probably be associated with that club and that would spark others to join thereby creating a chain reaction of community service. If we can do that, then these children might continue it into the next generations and continue the chain of community service and help make the world a better place.

All in all, our school should defiantly consider making community service a necessary thing for our students. If we do this then it will help to make our community a better place, which is what we want for it. We can add community service into our physical education classes or maybe any other class, but in some way, shape, or form, we need to have community service in our school. So if you can please consider my thoughts and also consider adding community service then it would be much obliged. Thank you.

I believe that doing community service is a very helpful, and respectful thing to do. It shows that u are a good person, and that u care about others. Community service also helps the environment, by picking up trash off the ground so animals don't eat it, or making the ground look very nice. You can also help out at rest homes or take care of anybody that needs it. I also believe that community service would make lots of people feel good for themselves.

Other students might not like this idea, but helping others is just a very amazing thing to do. It gives u a great reputation, and makes the world a wonderful place to be. Senior citizens would enjoy it a lot if they had help from children since it is hard to get around, or do anything really. People really have to think about those things, i mean imagine if you could barely get around anywhere you would like the help from somebody. Community service doesn't just deal with helping others it also helps the environment, and the things around us.

When most kids think about community service they think bad people or delinquents. But, their not the only people that should do community service. Everyone at this school should have too. I'm not saying everyone should go everyday of the week, but at least one or two days a week for about twenty to thirty minutes. I hope u think about this, and see how important community service can be.

I think we should have to perform community service, but not a lot because we are kids and still get homework and have to go to school which takes up most time on weekdays. Most students would probably say that we should not have community service because the weekend is our only time to relax, and sometimes teachers give homework on the weekends too. But I think we can relax weekday nights and do a couple hours of community service a week. I also think that if you truly care for your community then you can take time to make sure it stays clean, or to help a smaller child with school work because any community service can make the community a better place with better living conditions. Taking care of the community is very important because we are the next generation and we should care about where we live and if it is clean environment, and children get help with school work or homework, or if it is a pig-sty and trash is everywhere because no one wants to, or has to clean it up, and no one cares about helping the children with their work.

I think that all students should be helping and doing community service. My reasons for this are it will lets kids get out more and meet new people, some kids will get more exercise, for some it will help on a college application, and others could learn a sense of respect.

All student should have a certain amount of community service time a week and they should have to complete it or they will be punished. Such as they would need to pay a fine or for the school they would have a detention or even suspension. If you realize kids aren't doing community service and they keep getting punished then you could start something where their is a certain amount of hours a week you need to do, you can randomly pick kids for each week to do it so not everyone is doing it a week. If you occur to have a problem with kids not doing it then you could count it as a grade and it will effect their school work, then some people might be more cautious about what they are doing. you could also make some exceptions so if someone were to be going away for that week they could be moved to the next week.

I feel if kids would be required to do this then they can choose what they would like to do. Such as some could go around picking up litter or some could help at an animal shelter or at a food drive, depending on what they like. Some kids may enjoy doing community help so then you could have the option of letting kids do extra hours. some kids enjoy working with animals so they would maybe want to do the animal shelter but if the same people keep choosing the same thing it wouldn't be very fair to the kids who are doing things they don't like every week.

Community service is very important.

It helps make the community a better place for everyone.

I think that every student should do a little bit of community service.

Even if it is just for 30 minutes a week, it will help.

If the students are doing community service such as cleaning up trash at a park or on the side of the road, we will have a more clean environment.

Helping at elementary schools can help students raise grades, and the teachers wouldn't have to stress so much about some students that aren't doing their best.

One suggestion I have is that we do an activity at school that involves community service.

We could go read to maybe read to a kindergarten class or do some arts and crafts with them.

We could also go on a walk around the school with plastic bags cleaning up trash and putting them in recycling bins.

If the problem is students not wanting to do service then they could be rewarded after doing it.

For example students are always looking for reasons to get more lunch time.

You could have a service project after school once a week and however many students show up you could add that many minutes to their lunch time.

Another way you could get students to do community service is have them bring you a teacher note saying that you were doing community service and they would be rewarded with maybe a tardy or homework pass. They could also receive free candy bars or snacks and a drink.

I think community service should be required at schools.

I do not think that community service should be mandatory because unless someone is jailed or imprisoned, even the law can't force them to do community service. I think it is unfair to force students to do community service because it is their decision to make. I am not saying that community service is bad. Actually, I think that I should do it more often. But you have to give the students a chance to make their own decisions as what to do for extracurricular activities. Imagine if every year, you were assigned an extracurricular activity. No fun in choosing it! Students should be able to choose what they want to do outside of school hours and off of the school grounds.

Another problem with this idea of community service is that it could take away from valuable family time and other activities, such as sports, parties, and even just taking a day and doing nothing. Students have less free time than ever nowadays. Are you saying that you want them to have even less free time? Preposterous! I know that I sound a little vehement, but I think community service is a great idea. Maybe you could have a community service volunteer extracurricular activity. Speaking from a student's perspective, the best thing you could do to lower morale around SCHOOL_NAME Middle School is force the students to do something that they don't want to do. I agree that a volunteer-based community service extracurricular activity would be very good, and I might even take part in it. But you already send us to school for 7 hours a day. Do you have to take away our free time, too?

I stand completely and vehemently opposed to a forced community service activity for many reasons. Most of the students wouldn't try at all with the community service. Imagine a bored eighth grader that has to read to a group of cute little kindergartners. The student puts no effort into it and comes across as unmotivated and stupid. Now that would be a great way to lower your school's reputation.

Mandatory community service is just a bad idea all the way around the whole wheel. The kids wouldn't even have their heart in it. It would lower the morale around the school. Even some teachers are probably opposed to the idea of mandatory community service, and they would be unhappy. Your school's reputation would go down. You would take away the students' free time. You would take away their sports. Their activities. Their time with friends. Their time to do homework (don't you want them to do that?) . Their time to explore their passion and find things out about themselves. Their time to do anything.

You should require for all kids to help out on cleaning the school.

The results for the actions of my fellow student's would be that ,

Our school would be cleaner and then everyone would be proud that they had some part into making the school a better place.

Some Kid's might refuse to help out if so then there should be a consequence. And so we don't have conflicts with a group of kids doing more work than other's and would feel used because they did most of the work while other people did part. There Should be a limit on how many pieces of trash or how much space you should clean up, how much time you should help a teacher out. This should not be during school, it would waste your learning time although after school would be good because you wont be disturbing anyone. If it's okay with the parents of the child then we should have community service for the school. Make this after school community service for us kids fun so we wont be bored and feel like if its not out responsibility to clean up and help out. For Example You Should Help out to and the deans, give us free dress day's as our reward i guarantee it will make a difference.

45F6FCBF0CCA,"Dear Mr. Principle 2/15/11

I think that we shouldn't have to do community service as a requirement because kids are already busy enough as is. Kids are always busy doing homework, and extra curricular activities like football, basketball, baseball, golf, track, cross country, tennis, volleyball, soccer and any kind of sport can take up a lot of our time. But, there are also other things sewing club, choir, and play practice. so as you can see, we are very busy people. It could still be an option for some kids though. For students who aren't in any activities like that, there could be an offer of having community service be extra credit of some sort. That could also help students who struggling with some grades they could catch up just a little bit with a little extra credit and that could give them motivation to try a little harder in school.

Also, community service could be an extra curricular activity! There could be a group of kids who get together after school and go some where or volunteer some where and just give an hour or so of there time. I'm sure there would be a lot of kids who would want to participate in that! They would probably help a lot of people out as well.

Do I think that making it mandatory is a good idea though? No. I think that would make a lot of students just flat out angry and irritated. Especially if we had to do community service for a long time. But, I think if you did incorporate some of the ideas that I suggested it would be something for all the students to enjoy!

I think that it is right for elementary school children to pick up there litter. In this letter i want to express that if you help pick up the litter it makes you a better person in heart and for you to say ""no"" to that is just terrible i know if someone would ask me if i wanted to pick up litter for them i would say ""yes, I would because it keep's this place clean."" But i do not think student's should be required to perform community service, yes it would be a good thing to help the area were u live but what if you have something to do or you have to be some where or need to do some for or with your family and friends i personally think that almost no body would want to do community service, probably in a room full of 20-25 people I think only about maybe 5 or 6 of the people in that very room would do it but the other 15 or 14 people wouldn't even try to see if they like it or if they feel good about it.

I think that you should not require all students to complete community service. One reason why is because we do not have time. Another reason why is because we could be focused on our school work. Also there are student that are apart of outside programs. This would really be putting stress on some of the students at SCHOOL_NAME.

First reason students do not have time for community services. Some students really don't have time because they might play sports or have academics to focus on. If you went to practice then you just get out and you have to go do community services that id very tiring. I know because i play three sports and when I get out of practice I just want to go home and rest. Also what if some students have lots of chores to do and you had a long day at school then you'll have to do chores then community service. Now put yourself in our shoes.

Another reason why community service should not be required is because lots of kids should be more focused on school work. I think kids our age are already stressed out on trying to make good grades and if you make this a requirement that'll be really hard. Our grades will start dropping, early drop-outs, and depression. we should be focused on getting prepared for a test the next day or homework getting turned in.

My last reason why is because most students are apart of outside programs. say that you are apart of the church choir and you have practice that is a lot to do community service than go to practice. Or you play sports or even if you have tutoring that's a lot of hard work to do for just a normal 8th grader. You guys should already know how hard it is to already do extra things in one day.

First reason was we would not have time for community service.

You have recently put forward the idea of making community service mandatory for all students in our school.

One of them is that it instills a strong work ethic in people my age who may not have a very strong work ethic.

I believe that you should not make us do community service. Yes, it is a good thing to do and will make you feel better about yourself, but if you make us do it then we really aren't wanting to do it ourselves. If you make everyone do it then the ones who already were, won't get the recognition that they deserve. They feel good doing it without being told to because of the fact that it's something they want to do. They feel good about it because they are the only ones doing it and that makes them an individual. If everyone has to do community service, it just becomes something that people are doing just because they have to, not because they want to and that's what they should really feel while doing it.

If nobody really wants to do community service then why would you make them. It's something that is supposed to be done by choice not by demand. It would be like telling someone that they have to go shopping when they don't want to. Getting told to do something that you like to do when you aren't told takes the fun out of it. If you tell them that they have to do something they are more than likely to ignore you and to protest.

Volunteering is a good thing to do but only if you are doing a good job at it. If you have to tell someone that they have to volunteer then they are just going to slack off and do the minimum that they have to just to get their hours done. As good as volunteering is, it's only something a certain type of person can do. If the person is patient, calm and caring, then they should do a great job at volunteering. However, if the person is rowdy, rude and selfish, then they aren't going to do anything to help the community.

Community service is something that needs to be done, but not by demand. Demanding something gets the person determined to do anything except what's being asked. While some people might actually take this demand as an excuse to really volunteer, others are using it as an excuse to goof off with their friends. Volunteering at a homeless shelter is a lot different then volunteering at a retirement home. A homeless shelter doesn't take patience or calmness, it only take a nice heart. A retirement home does take calmness, patience, and also a nice heart. People sometimes volunteer at the wrong places. People without any patience could volunteer at a retirement home and end up doing more wrong then good. People without any respect could volunteer at a homeless shelter and start making fun of them, and make rude comments.

Over all, making us do community service would be a bad decision because people wouldn't take it seriously and could end up doing more wrong then good. They will protest and ignore your demands. The people already doing community service will feel like they weren't getting any recognition doing what they have been doing. You should really pay more attention to the people who are doing the good things, then realizing that other people aren't. If they choose to volunteer, so be it. At least they will have a good application when going to colleges. They will be the people who get in for honestly helping people. The others who didn't do community service will have a not as good application to college and it will be their fault for not doing good when they could have. It's our choice whether or not we want to help people. Some of us will be the good guys, and some will be the bad guys. Either way, it's up to us to determine our future with what we do now.

I think that all students should be required to have a certain amount of community service. This could consist of helping out teachers after school, picking up trash at local parks, and even helping out with non-profit community events. However, the key to this institution would be that the students don't get paid.

In these times, I personally think that kids have too much money. Whether it comes from an allowance, or a gift, the students get too much undeserved money. I do understand that some kids work for there money, but they need to learn what service is, and the other kind of payment that you get from it. I myself have participated in many service projects, and over the years I have found that I get a sense of accomplishment that you get with nothing else that you do. This is what I mean by the ""other"" kind of payment. When you get money, even if you have worked for it, you just are happy about the profit that you have gained, and all you think about is what you could possibly spend it on. By doing service, you feel that you have helped someone with something that they could not have done without you. This could help to increase thoughts of self-worth, and self-esteem. Then that could lead to better concentration, and better focus on school work, and the things that are most important in life.

Service could also provide a good distraction from other things. If students have something good to do, and they realize that it makes them feel good about themselves, they will most likely stay away from other things. For instance drugs, parties that may have bad activities, and other dishonorable endeavors. In fact, service can almost be like a drug itself. Although a good drug, it can give you a high of self-confidence. This can then lead to an addiction where the victim would continue wanting to do it so that they could feel that way again. In all, service can act as a good distraction from other harmful things.

Another reason that service is good is because it will teach students skills that they may need later in life. For instance, I have participated in many service projects regarding service including building shelves in a concession stand, painting, building fences, and even bridges. All of these are skills that I may use, and maybe even need later in life. There is no doubt that service can teach students life skills, and lessons.

In all I think that service is a very important part of the growth, and development of not only our local school students, but of this entire nation. Service can lead to success in many fields, and we need to experience it to become successful, honest, and independent adults.

I Think that students shouldn't be required to do community service. They should be allowed to choose whether or not they want to. Some students don't have enough time on their schedules to help out , because of sports or other extracurricular activities. A second reason would be because they already help out at home with younger siblings and their parents. Most of the time they barely have enough time to do their homework.

Students should be able to choose for themselves not have someone dictate what they do after or during school. The time it would take to do community service would be depriving students of their education. I don't think we need any uneducated generations to form. Isn't community service for those who have done wrong to the community anyways? Do you want people to think that we have a school filled with convicts, or juvenile delinquents?

I wouldn't want anyone to think that about my school. That is why i believe we shouldn't be required to do community service. We should have freedom to choose what we want to do, just like the constitution says "" life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness""

I believe that students should have a choice in whether or not to help people.

Forcing the students to do something isn't going to turn out well.

Some people will be glad to help others, and other people will hate the idea of it.

As a student myself,

I would prefer the freedom to do whatever I feel like doing.

I don't like it when I'm forced to do something I don't want to.

Community service is supposed to be voluntary.

Some clubs require community service to stay in them, and that's acceptable because you can quit out of the club if you don't want to do the service.

Some students will do everything they can to get out of doing service.

They will fake illnesses, complain that they were doing homework, and family issues are sometimes problems.

Other students will not do a good job because they are not focusing on the work.

Students will even fake doing the service because it sometimes isn't watched over by an adult.

I, personally, would be the student who does the service but does a bad job.

I don't want to go through the day looking forward to the afternoon and suddenly find out that I have to work for the city.

Community service is sometimes used as a punishment for a crime, and should not be imposed onto someone unless they willingly want to do it or they are paying for something.

Children want to play games, sports, and with friends.

They don't want time from that taken from them that they can keep.

I like to help people, but I help when I want to or someone forces me to.

The forced community service may also affect the school's reputation for better or for worse.

Parents may think it would be a great school because the school is involved with the community. Other parents might not want their child to go to the school because it is forcing service, and some parents may not have time to take them to and from the point of service.

Students will not want to go to the school because it means they have less free time.

Some students will do worse in school because they already take a lot of time to do homework, and with service lowering their time, they will probably not do the best they can.

I think helping others is the right thing to do, but it shouldn't be forced without a reasonable cause that doesn't involve just helping people.

Your choices affect more than you probably think.

3D94C80366E7,"dear principle, i feel as if community service is just what children need these days. they seem to think that video games, texting and listening to music is something ""we need to do"" after all is said and done ask yourself do we really need this. I myself am different, our family has a farm so i understand what work and play are, and i think that its fun to work. However along with this teaches you life skills. so when i see how long kids can just sit infront of the tv or walk into a pole while texting i worry about our feature. For example it wouldn't kill us to help children at the elementary school with something they don't understand in math class or social studies, it would be fun.

TEACHER_NAME,

I am a student of SCHOOL_NAME Middle school and I think that every student should participate in community service. Community service is a great way for students to learn respect of not only their community but the planet as well.

I'm sure they will think twice before littering if they clean up trash or learn to be responsible if they help out at the local animal shelter. This can teach the students so many things while helping the community. If every student participated in community service then maybe at the end of the year we could have a fun day. We could have something like a carnival or let the students vote and pick a fun day activity. This kind of school activity would motivate the students to get out and be active in the community.

If you just show everyone how fun it can be then maybe kids would be more inspired to get out and even take their friends and parents to help out the community. If our school can't do community service then maybe we could at least start recycling which does still help out the community but we wouldn't have leave the classroom.

So please consider all of my ideas.

52233E7A7574,"Helping the community is a good thing, but people don't have to do it if they don't want to. But students should help out the community. i think since that we live in a good/bad community i think it would be good to help out the environment, or help younger individuals get a better education. Other community services require like babysitting, donating food, or donate money, not all community services are long and time wasting.

If all the students did community service, then the community would be way better for the young and the old. examples of a bad community for the young and the old would be like pollution in the air and on the ground, if everyone was smoking it would increase the chances of the elderly and young to get a lung disease like asthma. Or if we left litter on the floor babies could eat the litter and could go to the hospital or even die.

i recommend that everyone does community service even if the students don't want to, its good for the environment, the people, and the learning. If we did community service we would be a roll model for younger individuals and they would want to do community service as well and the cycle would keep repeating.

Though some of the community services we may do could be very dangerous. like picking up litter in the highway, some kid could walk out in the street to get a piece of trash then get hit by a car. I'm just saying that we don't use our heads sometimes.

But what i' m getting to is that community service would be a great idea for everyone to do. And there maybe some risks to this also. If we did do community service more people would come to this town and that means more students and more money for the school! which means we could improve some of the things this school lacks, like more space in the rooms, and a larger cafeteria. The schools budget would be sky rocketing. So were pretty much doing each other a favor like a i scratch your back, you scratch mine.

If people got word that were doing this good cause then the news would become an epidemic! more and more schools would start doing this making the world a better place to live in and there would be no more murder, robbery, or bullying. my point is, is that helping the community would be a great achievement for everyone.",4,Community service,Independent

I am writing to you under the concern of your choice to either make all students do community work. A few of my friends do community work outside of school, and some do not. I personally think it is their choice to do community work or not. Some may think it takes up time, and some may not, but I think that it should not be a mandatory option. I would like to do community work, but I would hate for it to be a job we have to do. I think that there is no use to it, if we are made to do the job. We would enjoy it regardless for helping the community, but personally if your asking me, we would actually be putting heart into it, if we chose to. You could make it to where we had three community service jobs, in two weeks time. Everyone should do community service in their lifetime, but I think it should be their choice when they do it, and why they do it. You should at least ask the opinions of students besides me, about the situation. So you could get an idea of which direction you should take. Don't get me wrong, this decision is all your choice, since you are the principal of the school, but I am just giving you my input of your idea. SCHOOL_NAME already have community service hours, ask yourself, should students outside of SCHOOL_NAME have to do it? well if your answer is yes, then just not make it troublesome of others. I am sure that other students would feel the same way about my idea, and have the same opinion as I do. It should be a well thought manner in your case.

In my own opinion i think you should require all students to do some want of community service. Not only to help there self but to help earth and its environment. For example student can help pick up trash around and even recycle.

Its not even that hard and they only have to do like once or twice every week. We can even help stop the ozone layer for breaking more then what it is now. That would help alot. I mean helping stop the Ozone Layer from breaking more is hard work. It may take years and years of work, but if the world comes together to help stop this problem, its possible.

Even if the hole Ozone Layer is a big problem , the community service thing isn't .The community service thing is that simple and students that participate can even get a reward.

This STUDENT_NAME

reporting to you saying that it should be required to perform community service. The reason i say this is because, young students so be happy to do community service to our community for that fact that we need it poorly. For example, if we did not give out food to the homeless, this people would exactly die for starvation. My generation principal is all about fitting in but, only thing would could do to make this work is show them what is to be done. Like me i give clothes that i don't wear anymore to the people in need. I serve the homeless at the ""community kitchen"" on the weekends when i am not busy with school work on the week days. See everybody should help our city would look horrible for visitors coming to see our well known city. Plus if the students can't help then why do people that do bad do community service but the students can't?

This a sad thing principal it makes me ashamed that my generation don't even care. Just think for example: what makes them think if thy can use the phone and text all day; if we did have people inventing and community help society then we wouldn't have so many phones out right now with different company's. Now think about that for a minute and now would you require students to do this? We students need role models and mentors to listen. Just like if Kobe Bryant wasn't a famous NBA player then people wouldn't try to be like him and Michael Jordan ; would they? Exactly we just need a mentor or a person to inspire this kids to help community society.

My mama said,"" If you do good things, you will get good things in reward"". This go threw my mind every time

I see something or somebody in need.

I know you thinking about this very much but, if u require and have mentors it will show for itself. It would show for its community and it well show for its famous city

"" Chattanooga"". It well inspire the kids who haven't payed attention and now seeing it in the newspaper or hearing it from their peers.

I think students shouldn't have to perform community service because it take time away from their free time, they already have home work and class work to complete and turn in on time. So don't you think its a little to much for them?

Some kids already are struggling with just home work some with class but a lot of people struggle with both and are failing because of it. So why would you want to give them another thing to do? I'm sure there has to be some people who actually want to but you cant force people who just don't have the time. Kids are kids they need their space and just some time to their self to hang out with their friends.

How would you like it if you had to do all that work and the only time you had a break was when you went home to sleep or eat dinner? Its not fair to the students that they have to do all this with out having a choice weather or not they want to do it! Its bad enough we have home work and school we don't need another thing on our shoulders making things difficult for us.

I disagree with your idea to require students to participate in community services. In my opinion we should have a choice in those sorts of things. Not only that but, what about homework, family, and other school or home related activities? There are some up sides to that idea and i understand that it would help the environment and make the neighborhood look a lot better. But, what about what the children want? I'm positive that there are some students that may want to do that and that is great. Let those individuals choose what they would like to do. For example, someone might need some extra credit and they could do the community service to earn that. Another idea is to make that an extra activity like sports or band. When would the students have time for the community service? Would it be during or after school? In my point of view either way would be interfering with either grades or home.

I'm sure that a majority of the student body will agree with me on these matters. I'm just saying it would be best to allow the students themselves choose what they want to do. Then there will have to be parents involved too. You would need their permission for their kids to do community service.

How about you hold a vote? Then you can see some willing participants. You could also send home a question form for the parents to find out their point of view. Either way you may end up with a few people that will agree with you. Well that's all my opinion on this matter. If I gave you some ideas then perfect. But if not then i guess i gave it my best shot.

I do not think that our school should have mandatory service hours. I believe that doing a Public Service is an excellent thing to do, but it should be sincere. If a student does not want to do a public service but is forced to, then they probably won't do it very efficiently, or effectively. They may goof around, which can lead to property being damaged. Mandatory service hours increase the risk of property damage by forcing all kinds of students to participate. It may just be easier to give students the option of doing and recording service hours to help with college applications. With this method, it teaches students to be more self responsible for their futures. If they choose not to do community service, then it is their fault if it limits the amount of colleges that will accept them. Unfortunately, there are some students that are indifferent to the quality of their education. This way, everyone will be responsible for their own education and how they impact the world.

I don't think we should all have to do community service. some of us have responsibility's to do after school or take care of. Sometimes i have to go home to let my little brothers in or i have to pick them up from school because my mom has to work late.

If we had to do community services cleaning up out side to make the community better you should ask are parents before we do it . It should be like and every other Tuesdays or something and we should have to sign up for it. like there should be a time start to finish because like sometimes i have basketball practice after school until about 5:30. there are a lot of reasons why we should and we shouldn't and that's why you should get are parents signatures before we do community service. If we did community service sometime it should be like a detention for people who are being bad.

And like some elementary kids say yes it may take up some of are time because we don't all get to stay out all night so if we do community service we wont be able to hang out with are friends as much as we want to.

Sometimes when children get kick out of school they do Community Service. I think all school's should make they children do Community Service. It's something to keep them busy and keep them out of trouble. Community Service is one of they punishments we have.

Well to start it off. Community Service is a important thing to do. It keep your culture looking wonderful. Most of the times you can do community service just by helping someone with they yard work. Its a activity for most people. My brother love doing community service , he love people , and the people love him. Community Service help a lot of minors that need something to do , and i think that will help most of them do right. Most of the time you see men doing Community Service by picking up trash or helping someone with a house. I think Community Service will keep some of them out of trouble. Its a policy for some people to do community Service if they get kick out of school, because the judge probably told them they had to do Community Service.

Community Service is like helping someone stay out of trouble. Keep you busy at all times and doing the right things. It Keep you from doing the wrong thing at the wrong time.

282920A19940,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service is a great thing! Helping the community in any way is considered a good thing, and I think it's great that some students are doing this on their own already! But you and I both know that there are other kids that could care less about what goes on where they live, or how it needs help. And that's why I have a proposition for you.

I think that every student should be required at least one hour of community service each semester. Because everyone should be involved in the community, and the community could always use some help! No matter if it's picking up trash along the roads, or assisting at a an elderly home, help is always good.

Now of course, there will have to be proof that each student did their hour. I think the best way to do this would just simply be a signature. All we need is a slip of paper that the student can fill out, telling what they did as service, and for how long. Like, say, a student worked for two hours a soup kitchen. Then one of the workers at the kitchen could sign the students slip.

For some students, that one hour will be something they do just to get it over with, and then wont even think about again until next semester. For others, they'll do their one hour, and then maybe five extra hours after that.

And for those people, I think there should be a reward! The reward could be that for every extra hour each student does, they earn a homework pass. I'm sure if you decided to move with that idea, you'd have to get the teachers consent, though. Or maybe the reward could be a party at the end of the semester for the people that worked extra hours.

Needless to say, if there's a reward involved, most likely there will be more people willing to work extra hours. And eventually, those same people who thought, ""The community is fine. I shouldn't waste my time trying to make it any better than what it already is!"", will realize what kind of good they can do for others around them on a daily basis!

I know that your trying to decide if the students at school should perform community service or not, and I would like to help you decide quicker by giving you some reasons and examples why you should require all the students to perform community service, to get credits before high school and learn how to take a part in helping the community.

To begin on why you should require all the students to perform community service is to help them get credits before they get into high school. I know that the teachers, principal, assistant principals and the rest of the staff at the school loves to see when a students achieve. Everyone at the school has a big part in a student life and a way to help them is to give them a head start. While the other students in high school is trying to get their credits so they can graduate from high school. The new comers which is the 9th graders would have most of their credits in that area and not have to worry about it that much then the 12th graders that can't find a way to do community service.

Another reason why you should require the students to perform community service is to teach them how they can help the community by doing simple things and saving the Earth without having to ""Go Green"". For example, if the students are sent off to pick up some trash in the sand by the beach , they will learn what the trash can do to the animals if it stays there in the sand. Some of the students might become heartbroken. So next time a student goes to the beach on their own time, they might just pick up a plastic rapper or a glass bottle because they know what those items on the beach can do to a sea creature or animal.

To conclude now you know the reason why should pick yes to require all the students to perform community service, so they receive credits before high school as well as take apart in helping the community.

I believe we all need to do community service. I feel that it will help the community and help us as students also. It can help the students at our school stay out of trouble, or give them stuff to write down in there college application. I fell if we don't make the students do it they will never learn to be responsible. They will never be pushed to help the community. They wont care enough to.

I think if you make us do this it will help our future. Some people need to do this work or they could end up in a bad place like jail because they wont stay out of trouble. This keeps those kinds of kids out of trouble and doing something that could change their life forever. Because if you think about it you get the kids of the streets and maybe they will stop using drugs and not join gangs or rob people. There are many things these kids need help with.

If you plan in going to college this would be a great thing to put on your college application. To show that you had something to do with your community would be great. Some schools really look for that kind of stuff.

Then there is just to feel good about yourself. To know you have done something in your community that could have helped people should make you feel good about yourself and feel good about what you have done.

If you want to please them I say you don't make the community service that long. I say at first you make every student do like two hours and then after that you have volunteers. I know some people will want to do like five to six hours of community service. This will also give a chance to the kids to make more friends and bond more. Sure I know there will be kids that will be bickering just for two hours but if you get every student to do that it will be fair.

I think it is important to do community service because it helps other students and the environment by planting trees and plants.

Not every community service has to do wit helping other students, it can be about helping clean the beach, planting a garden, or helping your neighbor. i think all students should do community service and it is not a waste of time.

Other students should do community service because they can help other students learn things or help them under stand what they are learning. not every community service has to deal with helping them but when you help someone then you feel proud . some kids like helping others and some don't, but it is good to help the community.

When a student helps out another student they feel glad and will want to continue with helping other. when students help other students then the community builds stronger and probably became more peaceful.

I think all the students should community service because they can help the environment.

Like cleaning the beach, so bottles don't hurt people and animals. Also when people live plastic bags some animals might think it is a jellyfish and eat it then choke on it. You can also help plant garden that can grow food like carrots that are healthy. Also the food that grow in the garden are healthy to eat and it would be fun picking the plants that are ready to eat.

Community service can also be about helping a neighbor. like help them plant a garden so they don't have to go to the store if the don't have time to go. you can also help your neighbor by clean there yard or mowing it.

Helping your neighbor can be useful because then it can help the neighbor and it would be better then staying home and do nothing .

I think all students should do community service because you can help other students if they don't understand what they are learning about. also help clean the environment by planting a garden so everyone can pick the plants when they are ready. clean the beach . you can help out your neighbor by mowing their lawn if their old or help them plant a garden so they don't have to go out to the store all the time when they run out of vegetable.",4,Community service,Independent

The Job of community service can be tiring but a man like you knows that putting hard work into something is a good thing. We have all had something we didn't want to but as we all it is either good for yourself or your community in the end. It can be like a homework assignment in many ways because you may not want to do it but it is for your own good and the improvement of your class grade.

I think that if we put in some effort into this than we can all do a good job and get this over with together. Not only will you just clean but you will also do something good for the general public but you will also feel good about yourself in many ways. You will notice yourself doing something good and have good pride in yourself. I myself and others are willing to help alone or together to help the public and encourage good in all of the city.

They should only have to do community service if they don't do there homework all the time. If they forget once they should be able to slide and get away with anything. Some kids fight in school, there the ones who should have to do a couple of hours of community service a day. I say that's the only they will learn. Also, they should have a volunteer stand thing set up, if they want to do it they can, but if not they don't have to if there one of the good kids out there. That would also take time out of school, so that would not be a good thing. The other kids would be in school why there out doing community service, or unless they have community service on the weekend. Then you could not be sure that everybody would show up. Everybody has to have there schooling you can't get anywhere with out all your schooling now a days. The state also makes you go to school a certain amount of days a year. I think community would be a good thing tough because people just toss there trash right out there car window. Also, the student could plants flowers and make everything look pretty.

Maybe community service would help kids grades also because there mind would be on objects relating to school. I say it would also keep kids safer. I say it would keep kids safer because they would nit be out parting with there friends, or gone out and trying drugs or little things like that. Community service would be a great thing if you asked me. Everybody else has different opinions than other people. I don't think the students that would have to do the community service would be to happy but it would be there fault for not doing the homework when it was due, or acting up. I think they should have a week to get there work in before they get put on the community service list. If they guess on there homework i say they should get there amount of community service doubled. Also, they should have a rule if they don't do there homework so many times, like if they have to do community service every week they should make them come and do it every weekend also. I say that because if they don't like doing there homework they mess up there plans by having community service then it wont hurt to mess up there weekend. There parents would not be to happy with them and the school for making them do that on the weekend but like I said it was all there fault, every bit of it. Also, they should have to go around to each house and ask the people that own the house if they need anything done. That's not meaning go out and talk to strangers. That would just be your punishment. I think community service would be a lot better than gone out and getting a fine, for something crazy. Everybody thinks differently than other people. That's what I say about community service.",3,Community service,Independent

If you are planning to make them work , make them work in groups of at least five or ore students. For example, if one student has a job of carrying heavy boxes it would take to long for one person to complete it. Instead of having them work by themselves let them have fun and enjoy the time with their friends while they work.

You should have some students be able to choose if they would like to attend community service. For example, if students become ill they can infect other people to become ill as well. Some students might have plans on the day the have to attend community service. Canceling you plans with your friends or family will be a hassle.

If some students wish to attend community service, give them a reward for doing so. For example, have a party, or take them to a buffet for their job well done. Or, if they wouldn't want to do those things take them to an amusement park.

You should let students decide whether they would like to attend community service for their friends or just the reward of have a good time. If you would like to do something else besides community service, ask the students if they want to or not.            ",3,Community service,Independent

I believe all students should perform community service . Community service is a nice way to helps out . Helping out the community can get you far in life . People that don't help out don't get far in life . Life isn't just about what you want or need . Some people don't get anything they want because they are busy helping others . If people help out the community it would be much cleaner and safe for other children . If there was a park that was dirty and we had some older kids from school help clean it up , it would be a lot safer for those younger children .

When students from school learn how to help others and the community it will take them farther in life . You want every child to have a good future and if they learn earlier its much better . Say your child is in the 5th grade and there school is helping clean a beach . Well , later on in life they will be thankful they helped out because everyone wants our beaches nice and clean .

Some people are to lazy to help out . If we teach children to help out now they won't be lazy in the future . Some people don't care about their community . That's why people say it takes up to much time because they are being lazy . Helping out the community should be something fun and it doesn't matter how much time it takes up . If its boring to you get a friend to come along with you and help out . The more help the better .

In the future we don't want our community to be filled with trash and things laying everywhere . We want a nice place to live and grow old . We want a even better future for our children, but if no one helps out then it won't be nice . It will be dirty and unsafe . The more we clean up and help now the better our future will be . That's why I think community service should be required .

Dear principle,

I think all students should be required to do some community service. I think this because its a good thing to do. Helping elementary school kids with lets say math can really help them in school. Maybe their parents didn't have a good education and they cant help them. That's where community service comes in, your helping a kid who needs help. Another example is helping out the elderly people, like carrying their grocery bags or helping them clean up their back yards. Helping the elderly can help them. Maybe their too weak to carry their own bags and they need help. A lot of elderly people now a days are dying because their trying to do chores they can't really do but they have to do because no one is their to help them do them. Cleaning up trash is also a good thing to do because your helping make our world a cleaner place. Think about all the sea life that's died because they got tangles up in a trash bag and suffocated because people are too lazy to put their trash bags into their trash bags. If you clean up trash your saving and animals life and that's a good thing to do.

Another reason why I think community service should be required is because it looks good on college applications. When you apply for a college their going to first consider a person who has had community service hour then someone who has no community service hours. They would consider a person with community service hour over someone who has no community service hour because that shows that they actually care about what's going on with the world.

Doing community service can also help you make some friends outside of your school. Also doing community service can help you as a person. It can help you learn about how its a good thing to do and also spend some of your day outside in the fresh air. If one day your stuck at home and need something to do you should go outside and do some community service it makes your day less boring and you get to get out of your house for a little while and do something good.",4,Community service,Independent

Helping, for the love of it and just to participate. These are just some of the characteristics that come to mind when you think of community service. Community service is something every one should take part in.

You should want to take part in community service just to say you did something to try to assist. Community service is good because your not only helping yourselves, you are helping all the others in your community. If you were to see people outside helping what would you do? Would you sit there and watch? Of course not, you would want to get up and do something too. Furthermore, doctors do say those without guilt have a longer lifeline than those who do.

Community service would just make it easier on everyone. If your assignment was to go clean up a beach do you know haw many animals you would be saving? Lots Dolphins, Squids, Jellyfish, Pelicans and much more. Also you would be able to help out some elderly men and women. They may need some help rolling around in a wheel chair, or getting up and down stairs what ever is necessary. Because, those helping will always be there to help.

Granted, some other people may say that volunteering is a waste of time. Those people are dead wrong, in fact, your helping people to make it easier on themselves to lighten their load. Or people may say that it doesn't mean anything. There is hardly anything more important than community service.

Just to help out and to make it easy for every one is what community service is all about. It means something and it is not a waste of time. That is why community service is something you should take part in.

""STUDENT_NAME, you should really come to the soup kitchen with me some time. It's really fun and the people are really happy that you're there."" This is something my friend suggested to me. I decided to go with her since I adore putting helping and putting a smile on people's faces. Therefore, i think it would be a great idea for students to be required to perform community service. For starters, there a lot of kids from our school that don't do anything out of school and the country is in need of extra help. Additionally, a friend of mine that goes to a different is required to do community service and he's happy and the princi

To begin, there are many kids that go home from school and watch television and eat for the rest of the day. As a result, they become lazy and end up, in some cases, gaining weight from doing nothing. If more students are required to do community service, it would actually give them an opportunity to go outside or to be with someone and have company. For example, i know for a fact, that STUDENT_NAME would rather be building a house for the homeless than watch another episode of Grey's Anatomy. I think that the principal's decision will definitely affect everyone in a situation like this.

Eventually, everywhere i look, there is a homeless person begging for money. Poverty is one of the greatest problems in the United States. I once gave a homeless person a single dollar and they were grateful to finally go and buy a hamburger at Burger King. Requiring students to be active in helping their communities is a good thought since some people, and students also, need some assistance. The students could help construct homes, feed the homeless, tutor the kids that can't go to school, etc.

Last but not least, community service isn't necessarily a bad thing to be involved in doing. Some other school require kids to do the community service and if they don't have the required amount, then they get punished. This would be an idea for the principal to ponder. He could easily punish the students for not doing what they're required to do and that would motivate the kids. On the other hand, the principal could also give the kids incentives for doing community service. For example, giving prizes to the students that perform the greatest amount of hours of community service. That way, the principal would be satisfied helping his community and the students would also be happy by getting something in return for their hard work.

In conclusion, i opinion that the great leader in the school should particularly make it mandatory for the pupils to do community service. It would give them something to do in their free time and it would benefit many people in the country that are in need of special services. The principal could also include incentives or punishments to motivate the students in doing the community service. Lastly, i feel, deep inside my heart, i feel that there are kids out there that desperately need to help kids instead of doing what they do. In other words, if the country needs helpers to assist in helping the environment and the citizens, then the principal should most likely make the students be active in their communities.",4,Community service,Independent
00F11421BE7F,"Dear principal,

As you may have well known, there has been much debate upon the fact whether students are required to perform community service to provide benefits towards our community.

I think we should be required to provide community service even if it takes up some of our time, because I would think that helping the community has more a reason than doing something for ourselves, for example people say that their family is the most important thing in there life, i agree, this relates to this, because our community is our family and helping it is like helping yourself and a lot of other people.

Just doing something that isn't doing something that isn't community service, I think, is just doing for yourself, for example playing video games, it just brings entertainment to yourself and for something to have meaning it needs to help one or several people.

I also think community service is a benefit to our community, because when people see us, they would be influenced to help out, bring more people to help out would not only bring benefits to our community but also to the world.

Make Earth a healthier environment for us to live in.

As you may think this impossible, it actually is not, because at first what may seems like a duodecimo group of people in a few days these people will influence thousands maybe millions of people.

Very few people realized what a simple thing can do people, that is why some of my friends and students don't agree with me about doing community service.

Influencing you to be on our side is a big deal, because since you have power over our school you might be able to influence a lot of people, including students, teachers, and parents. With your help, we have a good chance to make our community improve. I hope you thought over my letter.

I think you should require all students to perform community service. I think this because community service is helpful to the community, rewarding to the student, and helpful to the world as a whole.

Community service is helpful to the community because it allows all members of the community to congregate and socialize while doing something beneficial for their selves. It is also helpful because the people would be making their society a better place. The people of that certain community will have an outstanding opportunity to make the place that they are living, what they would like it to be. Such things as volunteering, picking up trash, and donating can also help a community become a safer place and bring the people of that society closer together.

Requiring all students to do community service is very rewarding to us students because we will know that we have done something very special. Picking up a piece of trash may seem like a simple task, but it will actually feel rewarding to us because we would know that that one piece of trash has been eliminated from our community which has eliminated a small part of the nasty dirt and grime.

Community service is helpful to the world as a whole because it will make this earth a safer and cleaner place to be. Picking up trash is beneficial to us people, animals, and plants. Donating things such as clothes or food are very beneficial to those people who cannot afford those items and who are homeless. Community service can also sometimes fun; when people are having fun, they're a little bit more jolly and kind to people.

Everyone should do community service at some point because it doesn't take much time, and it is very rewarding. So please require all students to do community service if you want your world to be a better place.      ",4,Community service,Independent

I have been told that you are deciding whether you should give your students community service, well i think you should only give your students community service is if they did something bad. Community service is really for people who have did something bad, but also you can volunteer to do it for your community, just to help your community stay clean and nice. People shouldn't think that doing community service wastes your time because it doesn't, you need to do something positive in life, you should be glad to do something positive. If you're an adult, and you did something bad and you had to go talk to an elementary school, I would tell them not to do what I did because they wouldn't wont to be in situation I'm in, so then they would no not to do bad stuff when they grow to be an adult. I believe that some people don't want to do community service because they think somebody would see them out there, and they would start laughing at them and they'll get mad. It would be good to start community service at a young age, so you will have that care in you throughout your life.

2BEB2656C8B4,"Community service. A benefit of students or a benefit for the school-board and government? Opinions may differ on making community service mandatory. However, in my opinion I believe when a student is credited with schools by serving for his or her community it is something that should be mandatory. This is because I believe, it will open doors for students who need a better image to the school of their choice, it can help their community be a better place for them, and others, and last, I believe it gives a chance for a student to organize their time and make their time better planned if not already planned. Although my belief is that, yes indeed it should be mandatory, at the same time I believe it cannot place a student in a type of lock from a personal life.

The opportunities for helping others is endless. School that look at community service hours can look at a student that has contributed to helping their community and see a student with a good image to helping their community. For example, a school that may require a student to have a certain amount of hours of community service can allow a student to have that requirement addressed because the community service was mandatory anyways. A student can have a good image to applying to a school and will have a good deed done to their community.

Helping a community although seeming dull or as an unrewarding task can help a student or person make a better place for which they live in. A student can be helping the place they live in become a better place. They can, in an example, show others that planting trees or cleaning litter can make their community a better place to live in and look at. Helping a community that one resides in can make a person happier about living in that place and happy about the idea that they have contributed to their community. It can also help a person's course in life.

A person can organize their time better when they are put in a situation that can change their life style. For example, with the mandate of community hours being served a person can be self educated on how to organize their time better. When a person has nothing to do at all they may give that time to a better cause, this being, community service.

A person may want to do other activities but they may not contribute to their lives very well. Community service can give a person the effort they need to be person that is well organized and that can have a good time doing so. Helping others is rewarding and the individual doing this just cause can raise the level of integrity.

Committing an action that is mandatory is something to get used to. The students that are mandated to do community service may get used to doing this service anyways and may start to enjoy it especially to do this action with friends. The opportunities, helping others and becoming a better person all seem as nice rewards from doing community service; and even so mandated, these rewards can still exist.",5,Community service,Independent

I think it would be a good thing for us teens to do community service because it will give us something to do after school of stand of going home doing nothing.

We should go and serve them food and give them toys , gifts, clothes, and shoes. We should also try to take them to Disney land or castle park some where they can have fun and see things they never saw.

Well my friends don't think it will be fun but i think it will be a really good time.

I feel that kids should be required to perform community service. The reasons for this is because it would really help kids understand the fun of giving back to the community. Also just because you do community service, doesn't mean you have to give up ALL your free time. I am required by my mother and father to perform a certain amount of hours of community a month, and I still have time to get done every thing else I want to do.

Doing community service is a good thing for kids to do because it teaches the how to give back to their community. Teenagers can be very ""know it all"" sometimes and community service shows them that they DON'T know it all... especially when they get to help out on rougher sides of town. Also after i am done with my community service I always have a since of pride that wow i just helped my town be more pretty or helped a little girl have a backpack of food for the weekend. Community service give you a feeling that only comes from knowing that you helped someone.

Sometimes children and teenagers like to use the excuse ""I don't have time for that"" or ""If i do community service, i wont ever get to hang out with my friends."" Well it really doesn't take up that much time. Usually i am required to do a certain amount of community service for beta club or by my parents. I always have time still for dance, soccer, friends, homework, surfing, and afters school activity's and I'm a busy person.

Kids can use that excuse but really it doesn't take up that much time.

Well i hope my ideas helped sway your decision on the matter. Kids should be required by not only the school, but by their parents.

I believe that this job should be given to litter bugs. That have been doing the littering. Yea every once in a while if u see a piece of trash pick it up, butt to be forced is not the correct thing to do to students. We the students did not do any thing to be punished .

Everyday people ask themselves why is doing community service so important. As you may know or not know having community service helps us in everyday life. I believe kids should be able to help our world instead of destroying it. Community Service is such an important thing because it helps each and every one of us become a better person. Additionally, why is Community service such a important thing? Well having community service helps us outgrow and become a better person. You may say why does community service and help our world ?. Actually what community service can do for each and every one of us is help our environment. Everyday in our lives we always see the same thing people littering and not recycling and doing so much to our world that were destroying it every minute in the day that we have to live. Furthermore, Community service can help us out grow ourselves and be more helpful. It can improve of how we live. Some people may say why bother helping the community and waste my life time if i can just stay home and watch T. V. or clean my house. Community service will help you be more outgoing instead of being just plain out lazy.

Some people just stay at home and watch t. v. or just plainly do nothing all day and spend their time on face book or my space all day. As you can see community service will you improve in how you live everyday. Instead of watching t. v. imagine what you can do everyday in the community by helping our world become a better place to us and the future. In conclusion as you can see if student don't have community service imagine what can happen to them. This is why having community service part of our world is so important.

Students should not be mandated to perform a service to the community. A community service is an action performed by students voluntarily. If students are forced to take part in a community service the job that they do will be half done. If you the principal feel at least a few should do this then create a club or class where the students have a choice. As I said before the job will be half done if they are forced. I myself are a perfect example. When I am forced to do something such as daily chores, I don't give it my all. I consider my parents lucky that I do it at all. If the students are forced you may have a riot of students and parents alike.

Please consider my argument before doing anything drastic. Another little detail you might have missed was the time it takes to do the community service will rip the students from their daily after school activities like homework. The quality of their answers on their homework will drop drastically. They will have a liable excuse. The constant use of the excuse might drive the teachers to insanity. Homework is no fun for students to do so they will use this as an excuse. Community service might take away many students learning opportunities. When they don't understand a subject in school they go home to read up on the topic. With community service they don't have the time.

Also , community service would be a good idea because it can also show kids how to treat the environment with respect , for example no fighting , talking to others with disrespect. Another reason why community service would be an great idea , because you can show other kids that are younger then you some responsibility and leadership , for an example if you are doing community service and other kids laugh because its hours of work , well while your doing community service those kids can be getting into trouble for the stupidest reasons.

Sometimes I do believe that we all should do community service, other times not so much. Personally I don't think it should be a requirement. The task might get in the way of our life that we want to live. Some people have time to spare, some have such a tight schedule they can barley squeeze in time with their friends.

If you want community service to be a requirement for the school, you should think it over, maybe it could be a punishment for people who don't behave in class or school. If not a punishment, just a requirement, then you would have to think of the students schedules. Maybe they have sports after school, maybe a funeral, maybe they are going on vacation to see a grandparent or relative in another state, and so on.

If students take part in after school activities then that is their choice, but as a principal you should think of the students schedule a lot more. Playing sports, I know I do and I definitely know that sports get in the way of homework already going to practice at three maybe four o' clock not getting home at seven or eight o' clock sometimes. Then you would get home, sit down and start doing homework, usually getting done about an hour later minimum. Then you remember it, you have to go do community service this week. Playing sports gets in the way of a lot of things. Getting packed with homework every day and then projects and maybe one sport at a time, two at max. Doing community service would be hard.

Now when you go visit a relative far away, sure you can still do that community service that you teacher assigned, but you won't want to, you would want to spend as much time with that family member as possible before you leave to go home again. Maybe you will bring homework with you on the trip but you would only do it during the ride there and back, late at night when everyone is resting or sleeping, and then it would be to late to go do community service.

Now just imagine this, visiting a relative you haven't seen in a while, maybe when you were a kid or just one you haven't seen in a while, you wouldn't want to spend it doing community service would you?",4,Community service,Independent

I do not believe that every student should be required to perform community service. Not all students do have the time to go and meet a mandatory community service quota. If you were to assign students to complete a community service program and give them a grade on it, many students would fail. This would cause the students to be ineligible to do other school activities that they have signed up for.

However, I do support you with thinking that people should do community service, after all, it is their community. I think that instead of making it a mandatory thing to do, you could set up an extracurricular club that would help the community. This would make it easier for some students to get a grade for what they are doing and still have time for other activities that they have signed up to do.

If you were to make it a club, then you would be able to require the members of that club to go and fill a community service time quota for the year. Many school clubs do this as a way to make the members proud of their community and to show that the club members and the school care about what the community has to offer and what their community stands for. The club would mean something to everybody. This also has a chance of increasing the amount of participants in community service.

I think that all students should be required to perform community service. I think this for many reasons. Doing community service will be a great role model to younger ones. It will help influence them in the best ways yet. Participating in community service will also help students get into a great college in the future. Last but not least, helping the community is a great way to be involved. If you do not play a sport, or attend any after-school activities, community service is the way to go! Community service improves people's knowledge of their community and its people.

The thought of community service may not sound fun at all, but when you dig a little deeper, it is magnificent. First, what is the community? The community is everything and everyone around you. Even the people you do not associate with. Community service is volunteering to help out peers and others around you. Students should be required to participate in community service because it gives them a chance to learn how to help others out. This will help develop social and mental skills. The more they help out, the less there is to do around the community. Next thing you know, the park that used to be filthy and smelly is clean as a whistle! Four hands are always better than just two.

Helping out the community not only gives students a chance to learn about how to help out and socialize more, but also a chance for them to attend a remarkable college in the future. Colleges have many requirements; some may include involvement with the community, and others include school involvement in clubs. Having a record of community service will be perfect. With everyone pitching in to help out the community, everyone will become a better person.

Being a better person means being a role model for your peers and siblings around you. Helping out the community will give them the opportunity to see what it is like to help out. When they see that, they will become influenced and plan about participating in the future. Doing more for the community is always best. Whether it is picking up trash that people have littered in the local park, or it is cutting the grass at the public library. It is all apart of helping the community. Students should do this because it is a great experience. They will have new knowledge on ways to help out the community and ways to become a better person.

So why should they be required to do community service? Well, community service has many definitions, but it always leads up to one thing. Helping out the community. It is all apart of life. Being involved will get you to many levels. You'll become a better person and a respected volunteer. Do not only do it for respect, but also for honor and pride in yourself. You'll feel great. You will feel like a good Samaritan. You have lent a hand to your community and you deserve a great pat on the back. The local park is now cleaner than ever and your public library's grass is freshly cut and green like the crayon. Students becoming involved in the community will benefit everyone. It will cause a chain reaction to others in the community. People will say, ""Wow!"" ""What a great improvement!"" I'd like to join. They'll volunteer and so on so forth. All is well the ends well. Community service will lead to many levels of success.

I have heard that you want to make all students do community service. Well I do think that some of them are not wanting you to do that but me i do. In this letter i am going to give you some examples why you should make ever student do community service.

Well one is that some people need to take time out of there day to help there community. I think it will be a big help for the students to learn responsibility. It will also help the community to be clean and not have trash all over the place.

Here are some suggestions on some community service idea. cleaning up trash on the streets, helping out at the retirement home, and also helping out at the animal shelter. There are some examples on some that people do everyday. Me myself loves animals and would like to help out at the animal shelter.

Also it helps the student to take care of thing that he/she has. He/she will learn to not to throw out trash on the street because they will know what its like having to pick up trash on the side of the road. It will teach them to take care of there pets. Last but not least it will teach them to be kind to there elders and to take care of them, love them. It will teach them to take care of there elders at there house, there church, or at school.

Well this is my letter on why you should make students do community service.

I don't think we should force kids to do community work because some kids need a lot of time in order to do homework, kids have after school activities, and people have to go to religious events. Some people have their kids go places with the parents for a lesson or a surprise.

Firstly, most kids need the time to do homework for the reason that's just how they work. On certain days kids might have a lot of homework and not enough time to get it done, and adding a community service to the equation would make matters worst. If they cant get the homework in their ordinary time schedule, then how would kids get the required community service done and then the homework. I know I need most of the time to do homework, so if I were to get a community service, I might not have enough time to do my homework. Many parents don't have time to do choir after coming home from work. So if parents don't have enough time to do choirs and work, that means most kids really don't have enough time for community service and then homework. I wouldn't want to mess up the balance between time and school.

Secondly, many kids have a after school activity like basketball, running club, track, football and many other things. If kids can barely manage after school activities and homework, kids couldn't be able to fit community service into the schedule. Kids can be stressed from doing to much of those things and not have enough time. I know when i had football games and practice, I had to manage my time by doing all of my homework as soon as i got home. I know most kids can't fit three things in one day. It might be difficult to manage three time into an 7-8 hour time period when one thing might take 3 hours and then another thing takes 4 hours giving kids only 1 more hour.

Lastly, Some people might have an religious study to go to after school. My church has Weekday night bible study. I have barely any time to do my homework before i have to go to bible study. Most kids might have trouble with having too many things to do in one day. I know I had trouble making it on time on bible study nights. I had to stop going to bible study in order to fit football and homework in that day.

I think it is a great idea to help the community, because there are some people that don't even care about the earth as much some other people. also i think that when you are eating lunch you should clean up around yourself. also when you don't have anything to do you should help pick up things and you can throw it where it should be thrown in and that is the trash. After you do what you are supposed to do you can do that every day and that is how you will help our community. Also when you have helped you should go to other places and if you see trash on the floor pick it up even if its not your's. Another thing is when people throw things on the floor tell them to pick it up and if they don t pick it up for them. and also you can help the community by telling your friends and maybe they would help you clean up litter and that way you wont be the only one helping you can be the first person to start and also you can feel really good that you aren't only helping yourself you are helping others. and there will be a large amount of people helping the community.

I'm writing to you about students performing community service. This has become an issue because some students want to participate and others don't want to for certain reasons. I am writing you this letter to give you my opinion on what i think of this whole situation. I personally don't think that every student should be required to perform community service because some of these students might be handicapped or they could be sick. Also, if they don't want to then they shouldn't be forced to. For example, a way we could solve this issue would be to ask the students if they want to participate. Tell them that they could walk someone's dog, clean up parking lots in and around Marion, tutor another student, etc.

If they where to say no to that, ask them if there is anything else they would like to do like in and around the school to help out. For example, helping clean up the cafeteria after lunch, helping out one of the teachers in the classroom, etc. and tell them that they could instead of having to help with community service, they could do this instead. If they were to say no to that then just tell them that there's nothing else that can be done so they don't have to do anything.

Students could also get a letter from their parents and bring it to you and the note could state that the students parents don't want their child to help out. Or, the students may have too many things in there lives going on and they are too busy to help out with community service. Maybe, you could allow them to just come out and help whenever they want to and don't just force them to do it. That way those students who don't want to help right now, might decide later on that they want to and they could choose to come out with the rest of the students and help. Another idea would be to offer students extra credit for helping out. Maybe that way you could get a lot more students to join.

So, I've listed ideas in this letter for you, TEACHER_NAME, to think about. Students shouldn't be forced to do this if they really don't want to. They should be allowed to have free will just like the rest of us. So therefore sir, please take this letter to thought. A lot of students, parents, and even other teachers out there would appreciate you doing this. And thank you TEACHER_NAME for reading my letter. It means a lot!

There are many students that help the community and some that doesn't do anything. I think that students should be required to perform community service. Right now, there has been some crises about the ice melting and polar bears going extinct at the North and South pole. We shouldn't be hurting the Earth but protecting it. Try to imagine the world full of trash and people who don't care about that. One way to prevent that from happening is by doing community service. If each person does at least about 5-7 hours of community service, it can definitely change the result. There are many people out there trying to do their best to protect it but there's more people that either trash the Earth or just think that other people would do it. All the students should try to help so that the children in the future could have a clean environment to live in.

Tutoring students can be community service. We can teach them how to protect the Earth instead of trashing it. As students learn more, they would be smart to understand what the other people that helps are going through. We have to show good examples so they can follow it and spread the word out so others may join.

I do a lot of community service. Every once a month, I join a group that helps the Earth. We go to parks, events, and places where many people go to and pick up trash for 3 hours. I can't imagine how much trash there was. There were much more trash than I expected. Cups, plastics, boxes were everywhere and not the in trash can. Also, I tutor 2 kids every Saturdays for about 2 hours. I teach them every subject and also how to encourage others to clean the environment they live in. So in the future, they can set good examples to other kids at their schools. It may be hard but I'm glad to help out.

I think students should have to do community service .In my opinion community service helps kids become better citizens.

First, lets say someone is cleaning up litter as community service. By cleaning a park or the playground at a school the community would seem like a clean place to live. More people would be interested in moving here. They would think, 'Look at how clean it is!' or, 'What a great place to live'. Cleaning up trash as community service wouldn't only benefit our community, it would benefit our planet. We would help reduce pollution in the air and global warming.

Someone who disagrees with me might say that kids should have an opinion on whether or not to do community service. But think of this: how many kids actually want to do community service. Would you have done community service as a kid, i think not.

Lastly, community service would give kids something to do in the afternoon. More kids would stay out of trouble. Less kids would spend their afternoon playing video games. I honestly think that community service would have a positive effect on students.

I think that it is a good idea to put the students to pick up the litter because that way when somebody passes by the street or something they can be able to find it clean. i also think that it could help save the earth and its less pollution. the students in school might think that its a waste of time but to me i think it a great think to do. another think thing is that some students that need to do community service for what ever reason that can be one of the choice that they have. a lot of people when they are coming from another state or country can see that there may be a lot of trash in the streets for example there some bottles, paper, plastic, and a lot of things that can harm the animals. when the people help pick it up its helping the animals around that area and it also helps the plants and trees that is what we need to live but also by picking up the litter that also helps for us to live because its less pollution. the students without the other people telling them what to do they should know that throwing trash is bad for our environment. also when somebody sees that another person is throwing something and just leaves it in the street without picking it up that other person should say ""hey can you please pick that up and throw it away in the trash can"". if in this world people cared about the earth they would do anything to keep it safe and clean. so principal i think that putting students that can to pick up the litter is a very great idea. that way they can at least try to pick it up every once in a while, they could also get different students every time. and also they can kind of separate the students with one of the grown ups to different places so that way the grown up can take them to pick up the litter. it would be a good way to keep this earth more clean. i agree with putting students to pick up litter. and i would also like to help pick it up or get people to help th",3,Community service,Independent

Like if students help tutor other students or some students clean up litter around the city. It all can help make a change. Students can help elementary school children so they can understand more and succeed in learning of school. Other Students can help clean up litter to keep the place clean and so it looks nice, Go Green. Some students can Recycle things so it can be useable again. Other students can do something and raise money for the school need or for a charity to help out. Be a part of something, help the world be a better place. If you do something nice, you'll get something back in return. Help a hand and make this place even better. Be helpful with others when they need help.

Everyone is entitled to their own personal opinions on certain subjects. For example, opinions about community service. Some kids think its a waste of time to help out around the community, when they have their own stuff to do or worry about. But others feel strongly about making a change or difference in where they live, and keeping everything clean and organized. I myself like to do community service because it makes me feel good about myself that I can effect someone's life in a good manner, but not everyone is like me. I don't think students should be forced to perform community service because all of us are growing up and needing to learn to make our own choices. But talking to all kids and trying to encourage them to make that decision on their own is a good way to start.

We all have things we need and want to do, but we all have spare time too. Anyone can perform community service in their spare time, even if its just a few moments of it. Little goes a long way in such a eat or be eaten world. People always think community service is going out of your way to help someone, but its much more than that. Helping someone in need and making a difference in their life, or making the area around you like where you live is a great feeling. We need to encourage kids to take part in community service, but not force them too.

9075A6EEB3C5,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, have you ever thought about telling your students that they will have to do community service? Well, I have thought about that question and I personally think that it is a great idea for students to help out the community. Look on the bright side even though students my not think that is a good idea they know its good to help out at least a couple of minites. Some students would have to help clean up areas where there is litter on the floor, and some people would be doing some thing different than that.

Let me explain further, there is a lot of reasons why animals have been dyeing over the past few years. One of the main reasons why they have been dyeing is because when people though litter on the ground or on the ocean they don't relies that they are destroying animals habitat. For example when people visit the beach and they eat they fell to tired to get up and through away their trash then they just put their trash in the ocean on the beach, But the bad thing about that is fish might mistake the trash for food and that could cause them to die.

Most importantly, not only can students help out by picking up the trash that the see on the ground but they can help out little kids. For example if the little kids needs help on their homework you can help them out on there homework. Even though most children don't ask for help when you see that they need help don't just sit there and not help them out students should help them anyways.

I think that all students should have to perform community service. Since it is an important part in life I believe that to graduate from high school community service should be performed. Weather this service is helping the elderly or just going around and picking up trash around your neighbor hood I find that is a good way to help your community.

I agree that all students should have to do community service. One reason I believe this is because it may simply be helping your neighbor hood look better so that you may get new neighbors, and maybe even new friends. Weather or not if you already have somebody doing this in your neighborhood you should still do to help him/her out. If you are busy with other activities such as football or soccer then you need to take the time during the weekend to go around helping your community.

Also you should do community service because it can help you make more friends. community service does this as you may not be the only Pearson in the community working to get a nicer neighbour hood. weather you are just trying to work on your neighbors house by painting it you can help your community's value grow.

Another way you cab help your community is by volunteering at an elementary school so that you could read them a story or tutor them in math. helping younger kids can help not just your community but your nation. This can help your nation as they may just be the one to find the cure for cancer.

Helping around the community is an important part of life. This task helps an individuals develop well-balanced human characteristics. The lessons taught in school are remembered from the rest of ones life and should impact a child's thoughts. Therefore, forcing students to help their community will provide thoughtful human-beings that will create a better universe.

A well-balanced student creates thoughtful and loving leaders of the future. To have a variety of good characteristics produces kind people. Wouldn't the world be wonderful if everyone loved one another? These characteristics of thoughtfulness, kindness, patience, and so on led to no one being hurtful to anyone. If everyone could love, and be patient with each other the society would improve a great deal. Forcing the students of one school to get out in their community would create these human characteristics in the students.

The world around us is in need of much help. The global warming is taking over, and the oceans are just not what they use to be. If everyone would just take a little time out to help, this universe would be impacted greatly. The world needs to be saved and we need to take the first steps. These students at this school can be the ones to start with a little push from the administration.

Helping around the community changes the world and will produce a better atmosphere for our own children. Instead of slowly killing the universe around us, we should be stepping up and producing a better living society.

Some students do not think that community service is important, I think each student could do some community service, it wouldn't hurt. They could volunteer to do things at a sporting event or help someone with homework. Anything you do for someone makes a difference.

I would do community service. Show people that you care about what you are doing. If you think it's not fun than get a big group of friends together and clean up litter in your neighborhood. I think working at a food stand would be fun, seeing all your friends and joking around with them.

Each student should have required amounts of times to meet. Each student should have at least 200 hours of community service every year. Working with elderly people. Or tutoring little kids. People could work in selling food and beverages at sporting events. It may not sound all that thrilling, but it helps other people. It could be fun, just try it. Volunteering for things looks great on college applications, and job applications. It show that you are an outgoing person.

You could go to a park in your neighborhood and pick up trash that people littered. It's better to have a safe environment than a dirty one, and litter and trash that people threw on the ground makes everything look so gross, and not friendly. Helping someone out is not the worst thing in the world to do. It would make people happier with what you do for them, and how you show respect.

Everyone should do community service everyday. It's good to show people that you care. Community service does not take up to much of your time, it would be for an hour a day. It could be when you're not doing anything or when you're walking on the road and you see some litter on the street you could pick it up, it's not that hard.

Community service is a praiseworthy act of kindness.

Some people will do it the pure benefit of the community, while others have dissimilar opinions.

That's why it is vital to have children make this decision for themselves.

Forcing children in your school to do this task is disastrous.

Most students have many extra-curricular activities that they participate in daily.

Adding the community service policy would obliterate them of their precious time, that is already so rare.

Trying to juggle soccer, homework, and friends is already a great amount.

Adding this community service act is adding fuel to the fire.

It pushes kids to go beyond their capacity of balancing life.

By doing this homework won't get done, and therefore education is being deprived.

Research shows that 47% of children across America are silently struggling with school and life in general.

These studies conducted that having more free time to wind down after a days work relieves 89% of stress.

With these astounding numbers, how could you afford to put their health and well-being in jeopardy?

So much pressure is already on children these days; why add more?

Have you ever thought about the possibility of students not taking the whole ordeal seriously? Its an almost sure product.

It only takes one child to make a day of charity, a day of regret.

When children slack off, is community service really getting done?

If so, does it have the right intentions behind it? If not the excursion would be a waste of time for the children and the community.

No one these days has time to waste.

One might argue that doing the community service would be a great learning experience that teaches of moral and ethical values.

But, at school level ages, children cannot recognize these aspects of life or appreciate them.

The community would be given false hope of the children picking up trash, or visiting the elderly with no good intentions or understanding of what they are doing.

Let someone who will get joy and self satisfaction do the job.

Everyone wins!

While making your decision remember that these kids lives are in your hands.

Your decision has multiple outcomes.

To make the right one, pick up a pen and write a letter to the community saying that children are not ready to be forced into these duty's.

The children, citizens and most of all the community will greatly benefit your decisions.

Hello my name is STUDENT_NAME. I wanted to state my position to you about community service. I think that everyone should help out in cleaning the schools because everyone is apart of making it messy, like when you are at lunch, in classrooms, outside , and even in the locker room.

While in classrooms people are eating and throwing papers and then not cleaning up there mess. If they want to dirty there classrooms that not only themselves are learning in then i think they should have to clean up the whole classroom like the kids who make a mess that make the janitors clean up. Also same with the locker rooms. I see people throwing papers , eating and then dropping the trash on the ground and just walking away. Then the P.E teachers get in trouble because they blame them for not watching the students or cleaning up.

During lunch we get the privilege to go outside to have fun and people abuse that privilege and just dump there garbage where ever they feel like it. There are perfectly good trash cans right there but they just think no one can see them. Only there friends that do it too. One time we had gotten that privilege taken away because it was a mess after our lunch. It was not fun. Everyone was confused why we got it taken away because we ""never"" made a mess out in the courtyard, they tried blaming it on the seventh graders. So people who are littering outside at our school should have to clean up the whole school.

In my school there is a class where it is required that you have so many hours of community service of any kind.

In conclusion, I think that if people want to trash there own school they should have to pay for it and clean up there school. OR make it a requirement in 1 main course class to have so many hours of community service for that year. That is my position i hope you take it into recommendation.

Community service is a great thing because it shows us students to care more about other people and our community to make it better.

It would be make out community better if the principle would make everyone do community service. People should be required to do it because it would make our environment cleaner. Also people would take more respect in our community.

People would have a responsibility to clean up after themselves and others.

Our environment would be so much cleaner if everyone would help clean it. Most people don't think about our community before they do something wrong to it. It needs to be kept clean and not have trash everywhere. Since they are the people to clean it they wouldn't destroy our community. Also many people grafiti on things. Things are ruined from spray paint and markings all over walls or buildings. People need to clean our environment so it can last longer and be much cleaner for us all.

People in our community should have more respect for it. Many things are just getting done and no one is having respect to the people that actually go out there and clean it all up and try. If more people would try to not litter and do other things to our community than it wouldn't be half as bad as it is. People don't know what it is doing to our environment. So that they do know about it more they should be out there cleaning it and seeing how unclean our community is.

People would have a responsibility to clean up after themselves and others. Most people don't have to do chores at home. This would give them a way to learn how and maybe start to help around the house more. This could teach them in the future to take care of your environment and teach their kids about it. If they learn now than they will know not to do something bad to the environment. They can also teach their friends more about cleaning and not littering.",4,Community service,Independent
389BA8389F32,"Lately, there has been a debate on whether or not students should be required to participate in community service. I believe that students should be required to participate in community service. Community service is something important that students should do to help improve their character.

Community service is important because it helps build character. For example, when a student with low self esteem participates in community service by helping others in need, it helps that student build confidence. Also, if students get in trouble a lot, they can be punished by cleaning up garbage around parks and freeways. This task doesn't seem very fun, so the student will learn from their mistake.

I will admit that community service does take up a lot of time, work, and effort. Some students might not have the time to do it. Other students might be handicapped and not have the physical ability to participate in community service. It takes a lot of work to put down the video games or the remote and get off the couch to go and participate in community service.

However, community service doesn't have a set schedule. You can do community service any time you want and as your schedule provides it. For example, if you have to do community service three hours a week, instead of doing all three hours in one day, you can do an hour a day, three days a week. Also, if you are handicapped, you can always do community service by tutoring younger kids and starting programs to get other students involved. To add on, if your feeling lazy and don't feel like participating in community service, then just think about how your about to help improve your community to help get you ready for it.

I know a lot of people would say there way to busy to do community services. But I would tell them if I can find time so can you. I'm just as busy as anyone else. There a lot of fun and easy way to help out such as volunteering at your local soup kitchen, picking up trash, helping an old neighbor out, or helping coach a team. These may not sound like all that much fun but if do it with a friend and have a good attitude it could be a blast!

whatever the case may be comminute services is a great way to help others, and can be a lot of fun if you have a positive attitude.",2,Community service,Independent

Community service is a great part of life that I think every one should have experienced, but I do not think that it is appropriate to have community service as a required task. I believe that if someone were to make you do community service it wouldn't be the same as you doing it out of your will. If it was a required performance then it wouldn't be the same because you don't really intend to help, you would just rather get it over with. It wouldn't have the same effect if you were having to perform community service against your will rather than doing it out of your will.

Yes, community service is outstanding but try putting yourself in our shoes. How would you schedule a date for community service when students like us our loaded with homework every week day and if our weekends is our time to take it easy.

A perfect experience was when I went to a church camp, D-Now, and we had the task of picking up litter from a local park. I enjoyed it but I really didn't feel like I had done anything because I had to do so.

Here's my ideal about community service: I think it would be remarkable if we could have one day of the year to clean up our neighborhoods and even go farther than just picking up trash. We, and I mean everyone in the U.S., should clean the streets of our city, and also feed the hungry because it is COMMUNITY service and no one deserves to go hungry. But then again that's just my opinion.

I hope every man, woman, and child will have the opportunity to take part in community service, not being forced to but actually wanting to do it.

Hello this STUDENT_NAME and I want you to require community service for our school. I believe that community service is a good thing. One reason why I think you should require community service is that it shows children and young teens good things to do. Another reason why I think you should require community service is that it benefits the community overall and makes things nicer for everybody. Also another reason why I think you should require community service is that it makes everybody much happier with a clean and nice community. Another reason why is that old people or people who are physically disabled may have a easier life with help from the community. My final reason why I think you should make community service required is that it could teach criminal or people who have run into trouble with the law a lesson by cleaning up the community. Thank you and please require community service for our school.

My take on whether students should do community service is that they should do it but when they have time. I know helping the community is very important and that it should be supported ,but people are have things to do on their own time. They should decide to do it on their won time because we have to think about them not only on community service. Like helping out in a shelter, people have their own opinion on what they should do, and my take on this is that people can decide on themselves. Helping out on the community is also important because we don't know if there are things to do when they need it most. Some people wouldn't mind helping charities, helping out at a local library, or even helping out the neighborhood and help pick trash. On the other hand, there are some people that are not even interested in community service that don't care if the trash doesn't be picked up or even at least help the community in another way. We are people that think best for ourselves and for others. I know a principal like you would love to help the community out and I cherish that , but people are people and they will think what's best for them and best for their surroundings. I think that all of this is important and we should all take part in this.

I think that having students perform community service is a good idea. It can be beneficial to them in many ways and it is good for the community. I will tell you why I think having students perform community service is a good idea.

First off, having students perform community service helps them gain respect in the community. The adults of the community will see the students as being good for their community and not as a pest or troublemaker if they perform community service. The students will have an easier time growing up and being accepted in the community If they did community service as a child and the adults appreciate it.

Next, I think having students perform community service teaches them values. If they perform community service when they are young, they will most likely keep on when they are older and be a good part of the community. People who tutor kids when they are younger may go and be a teacher when they grow up. Students can perform community service in the field they want to work in when they grow up. If a student wants to be a scientist, he can help his science teacher or help at the lab.

Finally, I think having students perform community service is good because it keeps them out of trouble. If a student likes to graffiti buildings, he might stop because he or one of his friends might end up cleaning it. It also keeps students busy, so they will be less likely to get involved in gangs and drugs.

I think making students perform community service is a good idea for these reasons. It helps them gain respect in the community, teaches them values and keeps them out of trouble. A student can make a difference on his own, but making him perform community service helps them make a difference.

Helping others who are in need are important. Would you like help if you were in need of it?

Doing at least a weeks worth of community service is not going to hurt anyone. Community service can help build character and give a child some experience. Community service like picking up litter is go for the environment.

If we plan on living on earth, for many decades to come we need to take care of the earth. Conserve water, pick up trash and just see how much less trash there is and how healthy the earth looks. Tutoring some one is very helpful to. If a child needs help or is struggling with some academic subjects someone guiding them and helping them along the way to greater success in life and passing high school and college will be a much better future other wise with out all things you learn earlier in a child's life.

Requiring students to do a week's worth of community service is okay, but if you are deciding to make this mandatory you should make it so they have to have it all done by the end of that year that you assign it and it should be required that only for one year. This will give the students time to get this done and it will not interfere with their busy everyday lives or other school work.",3,Community service,Independent

This world is turning into a darker place. The problem is that people don't care enough. We see homeless people on the side of the street and no one stops there cars. We tend to ignore what is bad. Out of sight out of mind. I think that is ridiculous. We need to help others. If we don't then who will? All student should participate in some form of community service.

Lucky for us we live in a pretty good town compared to others. In Africa people are starving and here people are dieting. Everything can improve though. We still have poverty. If we help those around us we will make a ripple affect and can help the world. Ann Arbor has a lot of good opportunities to help our community. Food Gathers is a great program that I have worked with many times. They take food that is being thrown away and sort out the good or bad. Then with that food they make meals and feed the hungry. I think we could get groups of student to help out there sometimes. It could be a fun field trip that also teaches valuable lessons. Many organizations like this are beginning to pop up. We all need to help though. One person can create a ripple but a group can create a wave.

Another growing problem we have is laziness. I'll admit I'm lazy sometimes too. When students say its a waste of time to help those less fortunate we have a problem. You don't need to spend hours but only a minute to help someone out. If someone is so busy with school work and extra curricular activities then they can go online and donate money, even just a dollar. Everyone can help they just need to know how and be motivated.

When you help someone else you don't just help them, you help yourself. Helping those less fortunate is a humbling experience. You learn how to be a better person and you want to try harder in life. I once worked at a soup kitchen. I saw kids just like me with parents just like mine and they were starving. I am lucky and I learned just how fortunate I was there. I know that if some of the 'bad' kids went, they would appreciate what they have and be a better student. School isn't just about math and writing its about preparing you for life. An experience like this would defiantly teach you a life lesson.

Community service helps everyone. We can make a impact in our world by starting with just you and me. We need to motivate people to help, convince them that if they don't no one will. I strongly think that all student should require to perform community service. At least an hour of our time every month. Thank you for your time.

From what I understand you are deciding on whether to make it a requirement for all students to perform a community service. I believe that community service is a great task. Currently the school and the janitors at this school are far under-appreciated and I believe that it is time for our students here to appreciate them.

I think that if our students help keep our school and our community clean they will really appreciate everything that the janitors and everyone else who keep our community clean.

There is so much good that can come from the students helping around the neighborhood. Students will improve their social skills and learn respect.

I think that not all the students should be required to do the community service . I think that the principle would be very shocked just to see how many of the student would wont to cleanup their school. I bet that many of the students would think that doing the community service would just make them look very stupid to their friends. But what some of the students at the school needs to realize is that even if your friends may think that your crazy for doing it is not always about what your friends may think. Some of the times a friend my not know what` s best for you. And I say if you think that it would make a difference in one persons life then it was all worth it. And no matter what every person wants to live in a safe and also clean place no matter were you may go. And I think that if the principle would require them to do it then that is not fare on the principles side. Most kids loves getting involved in doing things for their community.

I think that for all the friends that think that it takes up to much time you should just try to work something out like a real friend would. No one sad that you had to work all day it doesn't matter if you only do the community service for five minutes at least you can say i did something to help out my school and my community. Not to may people can actually say that they helped make a difference in their whole community. So all for all I just wont to say, just because your friends may no wont to do something that doesn't mean that you don't have to either; and also to say that you cant make people do what they don't won't to do and that comment goes to the principle.

Community service. Something many kids have the heart to do and something others think is a complete waste of time. I am writing this to you today to tell you that many of my friends and I are currently involved in after-school community service around the Bay Harbor and North Miami area. With all do respect, out of our entire school I only know about ten or less children that are involved in after-school service. My personal thought is that you need to get the rest of the kids involved in helping things in need around our community. This is because most of them think it is a waste of their 'valuable' time.

All of the pupils are young here, considering the fact that this is a K-8 Center. The oldest of us are approximately the age of fourteen. Young enough to have at least a little time to spend doing a good deed which some of us kids do not even know the definition of. I am a true believer that ALL kids should be a part of at least contributing to one good deed per day. And if that task takes you assigning every single kid in our school a community service, then it should be done.

I was raised in a home where I was gratefully taught to be nice to others no matter what the circumstances were. But some kids do not have the privilege of having that kind of home life. And those are the kids that are not participating on making our community and the world a better place. There a re MANY people out there that need our youth, our help, and us students are just sitting around our house doing absolutely nothing.

You play as our role model in this school as the Principal. With respect, you need to take charge of these kids and take initiative to give the unfortunate ones hope to be successful when we grow older. They should not be considering potato chips, a couch, and a television as their valuable time, helping should be. I personally know and am exteremely proud to say that I have learned a lot and have come a long way. I take pride in myself and the good deeds I do for others. The feeling I have when I know I have helped somebody or something is amazing. And I think it's time that you let others feel the same joy I do.

This is your chance. And for most of us this is a once in a lifetime chance to have the opportunity to become greater people. The chance that will give us all a huge amount of hope and dignity for ourselves. It is time; the time to change this school from good to OUTSTANDING! And the chance for you not only to change the school... But the world.",4,Community service,Independent

As a student of your school i think that community service should be mandatory for all students. If we have community service it will make our community a nicer place to be with happier people. Also it will make it cleaner and not filled with garbage. Lastly it will help out our environment. this town needs it.

TEACHER_NAME

if we all could just be out with our friends helping our community for just 1 hour a week it would make our community much nicer. For an hour we could do things like clean up garbage. We could do things for the people and help our senior citizens, help the children of working parents, or even help people who are having dangerous though and who are unhappy. Also we could build something, maybe help build a park or even a new building. If any of these things were done it would benefit the community tremendously

The students could also clean up the town. There is garbage on the sides of highways and streets that have been sitting there forever. We could clean up parks and make them safer for children to play on. Also we could wash graffiti off of buildings by paint over them or scrubbing it off. This will only take one hour a week and will be something fun that all of the middle school kids can do together with their friends. Also it will make all the fun places around town safer for everyone.

Lastly if we can dedicate some of our time to the community it can save the lives of thousands of animals. There are things that animals will die if they eat, like gum for instance they will choke on it and die. Also many birds die each year from those rings that hold soda and beer cans, they usually wrap around there necks and kill the animals. Lastly if we put the garbage in bins the animals may not come into neighbor hoods and then will avoid being hit by cars. Just one hour of our time can save the lives of many animals.

we need to have community service here in our town. If we have community service it will benefit the community and its citizens.

Community service can be very rewarding to a students life. Many think of it as boring or stupid, but it can have a lot of positive effects on a persons personality and social life. Community service can create, in some students, respect and responsibleness that was not acquired before. In the end, it could help them learn the skills they need for their dream profession. It also makes the student more of a possibility for scholarships to a certain college or university with service hours on their application.

Very few teenagers actually participate in community service, and most who do don't do it often. This is because most students believe that it is a waste of time and takes away from the time they could use to play video games or hang out with their friends. In my opinion, if you make the service seem fun more students will get involved. Also if they are allowed to be with someone they know or are friends with they are more than likely to want to participate in whatever community service is being performed.

I believe community service can become useful and I strongly agree that it should become required of all students.",3,Community service,Independent

I think that community service is important. All of us want our community to be kept clean. The best way to make a sure of that, is to do it ourselves.

Many people care about our community. They respect this clean environment and never litter. Instead, they throw out their garbage to garbage cans and recycling bins. This is what every person should do. Sometimes people don't care about keeping the community clean. They throw out their garbage on the grass or a sidewalk. Most of the time, there is no people to pick this garbage up. Some people don't just litter. They might even put graffiti on public building. This doesn't make our community look clean.

As students who live in the same neighborhood, we should take care of it somehow. Picking up garbage is defiantly the first step. We could create a group that will pick up garbage in different areas every day. It won't take long either. If a large group of people would get involved, it would not even take 15 minutes to clean up a designated area. Another group could be made for graffiti removal. This is a little more time consuming and more pricy, but effects would be immediately noticed. It would make our buildings and streets look clean and new.

I hope you consider my proposal. It is very important to help our society. The sooner we began, the better for our community and people who live in it.

I know that you are stuck on the decision on whether to make students of our school perform community service or not. I am here to say that you should because it will be a learning experience to my peers to perform such a task. Some may already perform community service, so some are agreeing with me and others may enjoy it and will likely want to do it for the community just by doing it once. It may take some time, but it can be worth it to have a good feeling for doing the right thing. Many of my friends want to help the community, but don't know how and with this plan it is ideal for their problem.

One community service idea is helping the retirement home down the street of our school. It feels great to help the elderly for they might have done something important to us or is one of our relatives. I would treat others how I would want to be treated. Not may help them out, so why don't we lend a hand to the people working at the retirement home. My grandmother is there and I visit her everyday.

Another great idea is to help around the school by cleaning up some of the litter and helping out the janitors. Also the school will look fantastic with it being nice and clean. As well as helping our own environment to keep us focused on learning.

Making a mural at our school will make our school look even better and it can be fun too! We can make a mural of a holiday, memory, or just a picture! There are many ways and benefits of doing community service whether it is at our neighborhood, at our school, or even at another town!

I think students at this school should have to be able to put on a community service task. It would be helping the school and the community a lot. The world has been very dirty from people littering and not caring about the environment around them. if we got everyone in our school to help by cleaning up parks, recycle and also get other people they know like friends and family to help out in the cause, it would help this planet so much. You could have them do it during school hours so they wouldn't think that they are using up their free time after school. A lot more kids would help if it was a project in school and making it credit or no credit. Doing service hours is very good because it helps other but also helps you by being a better person. If everyone just did one community service this world would be a step closer to being a lot better. Each year goes by and the world gets worse for the animals in nature and for us. You could also congratulate the students by giving them a pizza party, jeans day, or even homework passes if they participate in a service. This would teach students how to be a good citizen of the America and also how to help this planet. If nature is killed by our littering that means we are losing ways to find cures for diseases. I think this could help this school a lot and make kids feel a lot better about themselves. the teachers cold get the kids to go down to lower grades and have them help the younger kids in school and talk to them about how its like in the next couple of years.

I like the idea of community service. It could benefit us in many ways such as getting into better high schools and job reference. Though i don't think it should be a requirement because people have many things to do like sports and daily tasks. It also depends on how many hours you must do because that could also affect my decision. It would be nice to have everyone do community hours if it was possible but sometimes you just cannot. Such as getting a ride there or where to go. Those are the few problems that come along.

I think it should be mandatory at a short amount of time because then people would try to do it and not really affect their lives much. It is possible to do this but some will not because they think it doesn't really matter. There should also be consequences if you don't do them otherwise people won't do them. Like if you didn't do your hours you could not participate in a event or they would not be able to go to the next grade level.

We should increase the hours of community service every year. At first we should have two hours then three and we build off of that. We could also do it by grade level such as 6th grade three hours, 7th grade 5 hours, and 8th grade 8 hours.

I think you should require students to perform community service because of these reasons. The first reason is because if some students behave bad they could do community service for as many hours you think they deserve to get and it depends of they did if it was bad or really bad.

The other reason is because students should care about taking care o f their community, so the community can stay clean and nice so people could say that is a good an organized community. Students could show an example to the little kids to keep their community to stay clean , nice and organized so people could say something nice about their community.

Another reason is because maybe many students are bored or care about their community so just have them help out in whatever the community needs help on and maybe thank them for helping . But some kids think that community service is a waste of there time because they don't want to help out maybe cause they're to lazy or cause they don't want to help.

I think students shouldn't have to perform community service because students sometimes have issues at home were they cant stay after school for activities. One reason they might not be able to do community service is because they might have a love one that is sick at home and they have to be there for there aid. Second reason is because a student might have financial problems at home were they may have to take on a part time job after school to help around the household with payments. The final reason is that student there self may have health issues forbidding them from doing any community service. Those are the reasons why a student may not be able to do community work after school because of personal issues.

Also students shouldn't have to perform community service because they might have other activities, clubs, groups or sport related things happening after school. One reason is they might be too busy after school everyday to do anything else on the side such as being on a sports team for the town or at school. Second reason is because they might be in a church group that meets everyday to sing or study. The final reason is because a student may just be busy doing regular things like watching a relative after school while their parent or guardian is at work.

9CB26CEEE2D7,"I think community service should be something everyone does to help others, or to help the Earth. Some people think community service is a waste of time, but when the air is polluted, and more people get sick per week or day from it, it is time to start cleaning up are community!

I think the help of the elementary kids would be great for them, so they can get work done, and not just have to ask the teacher for help, but they can ask their tutor also. Also, they can go home after school, and have no work with a tutors help. The tutor would feel good at the end since the student they helped enjoyed the help of the work, and also enjoy meeting someone new to them.

The community need to be cleaned up so our air pollution can get better than what it is right now. We should have a couple kids clean up places during study hall hours, and after school. Also, the lakes, rivers, and oceans are getting polluted from all the junk in the water. So all the fish, turtles, and other sea creatures are dying from the pollution thrown onto the ground, which can get blown into the water, or thrown into the water. I think we should have kids recycle paper and other recyclable items to reuse them, instead of cutting down trees for the paper, and make the new items.

The schools should have a Recycling competition where the Study hall class that brings in the most items to be recycled, get a free day party for the study hall the whole week. The competition goes on each month. After each month, they have an assembly to get all the items collected, then they put them together to see how much they recycled that month. It would encourage kids to recycle more often, and give a little bit of a competition for the school.

Community service is a good thing to help clean environment, and also help other who need it. If we didn't have community service, our community and planet would be a wreck. We need more people to help for community service so it can go by faster each day, and makes others feel good about where they live. If we didn't have community service, you would mostly be walking on trash every step you take, since some people throw their trash on the floor instead of a trash or dumpster.

Some people dislike community service since they like to be inside the whole day either in front of a television, on a computer, or playing a video game. So they think community service is boring and not worth their time, but they need to learn that they can save the environment by just picking up a wrapper on the ground, and spending time away from the electronics, and go outside with friends, or pick up trash in their neighborhood.

The people that do community service, should be proud of what they do to help others, and keep up the work they do. So I think all students should perform community service so we have an excellent environment, and more people can look at teens, and not think of them as a bad reputation like adults do right now. They think of some teens as trouble, bratty, and they don't do anything. But other teens are getting looked up to by doing different amounts of work to help out, and also adults think they are a good reputation since they help out more.

well, i think all students should be able to perform community service. Because people as individuals should care about their community. Kids are a big part in community service; they can tell their friends in their neighborhood to join there community service and to stop littering. in my opinion everybody of all ages should be apart of their community services around town.

First, students in our school can start helping the community by beginning a school wide service to clean up their community. So you should tell your kids to ''go outside and find a community service to join to help our environment and community a better place to be''. If you are a kid you should go and convince your friends to join a community service and start recycling.

Secondly, America as an individual should stop littering. Littering has cause air pollution and that's why you need to stop litter now.

Also air pollution has gotten many people sick. So just start now when you get done with a snack and your outside find a dumpster or run home and throw your trash away. Because your trash on the ground can cause pollution.

However, I hope that you tell your friends to join your local community service club or just start your own with all of your friends in it. And then your friends can pass it on to their friends and so on. But when you talk to your friends makes sure you tell them the reasons why they would want to join your group.

Finally, community service is a big part of our environment and so are you. And you can start by helping the streets get clean and pick up trash from around your neighborhood or at school. But it is up to us to make a difference in our world                  ",3,Community service,Independent

3. I'm just saying for an example if we did that's if we did ask someone famous to come to our school do u really think that will happen, they would probably pray for us.

4. Kids need to know how to clean up after them self. Cause I know i have to at home everyday we have chores I even have to cook every 3 times a week.

I don't see why we shouldn't clean up in our area, it's healthy, good for the feature, good for our environment, and people wont look at our school and say, ""This school is the worst school I ever saw, and the smell wow I'm so not coming here"".",2,Community service,Independent
DD2E2344EE9A,"Dear principle TEACHER_NAME,

I think the principle should not force the kids to do community service for their school. i think that for multiple reasons, many people have busy schedules especially people in middle school or high school. A lot of people have sports, after school clubs, a busy life just with the family, goes out with friends or a boyfriend/girlfriend. If the principle then puts community service they might not be able to do it and it could become stressful for somebody who already has a busy life.

Also it could be a good idea because there are a lot of lazy people who don't really get outside to much and the community service could be good for them. Then for bad kids they would get forced to do it as like a discipline thing, or like it could teach bad kids to do good because they are doing good stuff. Or just for kids who want to do the community service. the kids who want a little bit or excitement and achievement in their life. High schools look at community service and volunteer work and those people who want to get into a good high school that will help them.

I say in this situation for wether or not to put in community service to schools i say they have kids choose if they want to do it, for either a grade for school high-school recognition or both. If kids don't want to do it they don't have to but if kids want to they can o eerybody is happy.

9612843FDF1F,"Dear Principle, for some students say that ""what's the point"", ""why do we have to do this"", ""this is a waste of my time"". Don't let that get to you. For their trying to prove your weak, for that's why you have to make it a requirement in school so later on when they are doing the community service they'll be thanking you later in the year and be realizing they were wasting time on idiotic things that include video games or online chats.

Weather you decide not to think about the future when everyone gives up on community service think about your homes, neighborhood , your family doing the exact thing as the community. For when everyone gives up the Earth would be dying and the water would be scarce, everyone wants to be healthy so please, please don't say no.

When you decide yes, thank you for going with my opinion I will not let you down for i have reasons. First it takes 21 days to make it a habit so then from then on you wouldn't have to worry. Another, the Earth would be healthy, also the water clean and drinkable. Your family would be so glad this was a healthy place to live at and no liter anywhere. Students won't be to drowned into so much video games that they won't function in class because too much video games kill your brain cells. Now that won't be good.

So I would like thank you for taking your time to read this very deeply and highly recommend you to choose for this to be a requirement because happy student equals happy life. Also, when you have further questions I am pleased to answer them. When you want to make a certain goal make it exciting for them.

What happened if thers a event but you have to clean up for community service? Is right to do the right thing. Community service is important to the community because in the future the community change and everybody is happy. Some people doesn't wannabe help or they have other things to do. Is the same thing as school. Some students is in Community service.

First reason, that Community service is important because the mayor of the city will be proud. Some people say ''What a mess is here!''. The community service is come for help. When you left trash then later it will smell bad. Some people hated when this happened. Please don't leave thrash on the floor put it in the trash can.

Second reason is that when there's a event the people who work there have to clean up before the event starts. Some people think that takes too much time away but no. They just want to help people and the community. In school is the same thing friends doesn't want to help and some to.

Last reason is that there's too much to clean up and during the night. Janitors need to clean up during the night because when the next day comes it will be clean and neat. Some people clean up their stuff alone and sometimes together.

I think that students should be do community serves, but not too much only. probably only like one hour or tow. Because sum individuals might have things too take care of. For example some might need to take care of a sick relative or a little sister or little brother because there parents cud be at work or a meting and stuff like that.

Or maybe that a few students were out sick and out of school for a rely long time and do not have time to do community serves because there caching up on there school work. Maybe we can even make going too tutorials a community serves. I did that when i went to court when i was out for so may days.

We can even start a ""cleaning the school club."" Were students clean around the school and get community serves time.

I think Student should clean up litter because its good for the comminute, good for the environment, and other things. I'm telling you why people should pick up litter.

The first reason is that its good for the comminute. I mean really who wants to sit in a dirty school that has germs and other bad stuff. I wouldn't like that at all because i like to be a clean person and that is just gross to be at a school that hasn't been cleaned up since who knows when.

The second reason is that its good for the environment. It would be nice if people would clean up the environment because I like to see trees and animals but what i don't like is died trees and animals because what people through out of there car window for example soda rings those can kill a lot of animals.

The third reason is that it good for people to do. Like what I just said its good for both comminute and environment. It gets people active and going and its some thing to do when your bored.

That is why I think students should clean up litter. They are helping the comminute, environment, and the trees and the animals. Thank you principal for all your time.

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I think in order to help people in community service we should take the time to help people that are in need of help. This would be a great thing to do because it would be helping people. Helping people is a awesome way in showing how much people care about other people.

For an example; if we were to be require to take community service at school, some students would be need of help in math, language arts, science, social studies or anything that a student would need help in and would be able to receive help. This would make our learning increase and more student would be going to college. Parents, teachers, and even students want the best for themselves and with a help that each student could get it would make students comprehend and understand what the concept or subject they are working with. It will also make teaching easier.

Having community service will make students want to be focused in doing good things such as helping students or people and doing things that won't lead them to bad things. Community service will also help the community in having good and safe home and nice people around them. That's why i believe the principle should require community service to each student.

I'm writing to you on account of the idea requiring all students to do some community services. Personally I think that is a great idea, it helps students see the importance of helping out, and that it can even be fun sometimes. In today's world few people see the importance of lending a hand, so if the school would teach them the importance I believe more people would start to understand how important it is to do community service.

One reason I believe that community service at a young age is necessary is that in order to get into collage you most often need to have some sort of community service on your records.

Not all students enjoy doing community service or helping out other people. Yes it would be nice if some of them did take the time out to help. If you asked me for my option on this I would say no. For example some students might have to go home and watch their little brother/sister, and just don't have the time. While other kids might have a sport they play in and they have practice.

If you made everybody perform community service it would be crazy. Like I said before not only do students have things to do, but they might already be involved in an activity. As a student

I don't have time to do some things due to homework. Now just think would you rather for us to complete a certain amount of community service or get an education? Now once which one would you rather us do? Yes of course get an education! I know If I was you I would want my students to complete all their work, and then worry about staying after for school.

Now if the student had a little extra time maybe he/she might want to help the kids at the elementary school or even go volunteer at the animal shelter. Say a student jus got a call from their mother and it was a family emergency what do you expect them to do then? Yea giving back by helping another by student is a good idea, but not all kids have the time. Once again TEACHER_NAME my opinion on all students have to do community service is no.

I believe that not all students are required to pick up litter around the community, only the ones that have the opinion to help. I think this because doing things for the community is a choice for people to make on there own. For example, some people could be busy with family, friends or other relatives. Also, i think picking up litter near road is a dangerous thing because of traffic. Trash and other litter could be located in a troubling spot, mostly because some strangers can't be trusted. Most of the danger near roads are not predictable and students being injured. Weather is another thing that could affect students in our school by disease. This could take off of homework time or rushing it, making grades drop. Some litter is bio-degradable which means it will not affect our environment in a negative way. I am asking if you don't make the students in our school pick up litter if it is not there responsibility. Town's people should know not to litter.

699EBFBA9770,"Dear Principal,

I take your position in thinking to require every student to perform community service. I think that if you require students to volunteer for community service I know that some of them will be really mad because they think its a waste of time, but someday day they will look back at the day they did community service and thank their principal for requiring them to do that.

Many students of the school may have done community service. Community service may change the way a student thinks. Lets say that their is someone in the school that never likes doing homework, you may ask that person to do some community service like taking care of something. The person at first may think like why do I have to take care of something just because I don't do my homework. If you tell them they have to volunteer in a dog shelter they wont want to do it but if you also tell them they are in charge of everything and that if anything goes wrong it would be their fault. The student will probably get scared and do everything it takes to do everything good. After community service is over he will probably be a better student by doing his homework. If the student probably did change he would probably ask to see if he could do other community service.

If a student also doesn't do their homework you may ask that person to be a teacher in another school full of kids that don't do their homework, so the kid would fell the same way the teachers fell when some of their students don't do their homework. The student will feel very bad for their teacher, and when they come back to school they will always do their homework and say sorry to their teacher for never doing their homework. After that happens the student will go back to the school where the students don't do their homework and ask them to please do their homework. He will also tell them that he never used to do his homework but he came to this school is search of trying to change his mind about doing homework. He could also tell them that he believes in them and that everybody could do their homework and that all they had to do is try. With that little that person has done he could change a whole school and the way students fell in school. If you do your homework you could go to a good college and study something you like and becoming a very successful person in life.

Personally i enjoys helping the community and that i will try to make time for it. But some people don't have the time to. If it isn't sports or school work. Community service is one of the things that look good on a college application. And also it may lead to good things like a better understanding of the things going on outside of your school.

I Think that community service should be taken very seriously. Although kids would love to sit on the couch and play video games or text on their phones, they should know how precious it is to help the earth and others out. The time it would take to give community service is very subordinate compared to all the time the kids & teens spend playing video games and texting. They should realize that their later lives are going to be impacted by the way they act now. If they are indolent and wont help the community, how are they going to be able to survive in our hrsglive when they don't live with their parents anymore?

To answer your question, Yes i do believe that kids should be obligated to perform community service every month for 2 or 3 hours. The two hours it takes to do the community service will be very deficient compared to all the time they spend on the couch or texting.

By doing community service the child would gain physically and mentally. He or She will be physically active while he or she does their job. He or she will gain knowledge greatly appreciated in later years. Like how to cook and clean, and how to plant and use the foods you grow. There are many life skills that can be used in the child's later years.

My final conviction is, yes i believe that it is the new generations necessity to stand up and say that they WANT to give to the community in servitude.",3,Community service,Independent

I think it would be great if you would make the students of our school participate in community service. It's time to give back. You should talk to the teachers and see what they think. I for one would completely participate in community service. I think the teachers should count the community service as a grade, extra credit, bonus points on a bad grade, or a quiz grade. Then they would be forced to do it, unless they were sick. Then they would have to make it up on more community service.

Do you think we could visit nursing homes as a community service project? I have been to one before and I loved the feeling I got when I hugged them and wished them a Merry Christmas. I know they were so happy to see some body that actually cared about them on a holiday. Others may think it's stupid, but it would make them happy and that's giving back to the community. We could also have a trash pick up day around the town or around the school and the student or group that has the most trash wins a prize and their picture in the local newspaper. I hope you think about these two community service ideas.

I love helping the environment, giving back to my community, and making the town of

Shallotte a better place to live. Also it doesn't have to be just for students and teachers any body who wants to help, families, friends, neighbors, visitors, can help us make this town a better place to live and vacation here. Please ponder with the suggestions. I know people that would love to help and I know everyone will want to help.

It's time to give back and stop being so selfish, give back to the community.

Maybe we could get some bands to perform or maybe some famous singers, get some sponsors, and have a community service day at the park where all we do is community service and raise money for places and services. Like St. Jude, or homeless shelters. We should bring gifts for each other and kids and grown up's. It will be amazing. Please think about my ideas and talk to the mayor and maybe show him my letter.

Well we can't be forced to do community service if we don't have to, volunteering is just fine. Because however we do want to do some things either than cleaning, just because it's recommended, doesn't mean we have to. If other people choose to do it by their own will, that's their choice, obviously. But other people do think differently and will go against it, which is what I'm trying to write to you of course.

For example, if you ""require"" us to do community service even though we don't want to. It's like slavery for us kids. Though you think it's good for us, there's other people who would love to join the people who's volunteering for community service. Okay numerous of us are doing it, either it's punishments or volunteers or it's just your job period. It's good to do community service but really you can't force us unless you want slavery in the United States again.

Though I'm going against it, I'll still write you a pro about letting students take action on community service. First of all, we're just sitting down mostly our days watching TV and computer games. This would actually help us get to know more people, and be more social. Also, depending on what we're volunteering for, also a good work-out. For what reason this is going to effect everyone, making all your students do this requirement might get alto of parents to come to your school, just to punish their kids for doing certain things and bringing them into awkward situations.

In conclusion, my point is not to require students for community service. Because it's just of course like forcing us again. For what I heard , slavery wasn't allowed in United States. We should get the right to do as we may, according to the law. Not everything , but in this case, we have the right to say no for educated students to perform community service by will. Some good may take in this course, but not all good. Though you think it'll be good for us students, learn some things. But for us, it's unfair and cruel. Somehow if you're volunteering as I wrote. It's okay because that's by their choice. So as I write this again, I say no to requiring students of our age and skill to do community service.      ",3,Community service,Independent

Many people think that cleaning trash is very helpful and many people think it wastes time. I believe that the students should choose whether or not if they would like to clean trash or spend their time doing what they want to do. Some students might not clean litter but those students may be doing something else for the community. Furthermore, it should not take many people to clean much trash. Students may also be cleaning trash on their own time as well.

People who tutor the elementary school kids, that is very nice, but some students also think it wastes time. Let those students choose to tutor or not. Some students may have important activities to do and cannot afford to waste that time. For example, some students have a sport team to go play with or practice. Others may have after school classes to attend to. Many students can help trash but there are many who cannot afford to do those stuff.

Community service takes time and lots of effort. Time many students don't have. Not only do we have loads of homework we also have family things to do when we get home. We have so much to do as it is adding more requirements will only add stress to both students and their parents.

Students are scrunched for time as it is and adding another thing to the to do list won't help. As a student I know how quickly a day flies by because of lack of time. I go home do my homework and then clean. After that I get ready for bed and then I relax and calm down. I do that by watching TV or going on the computer until nine o'clock, then it's off to bed. We wake up get ready for school and do the same thing all over again.

Plus, there are the students who play sports after school and they have to get homework done as well. We simply don't have time for much more than we already have.

When students are at home it is there time with family. Family is important for most students and some juggle so many different activities it wouldn't be right to make them juggle even more and then have them not be able to see their family as much. Students need a break to relax at some point. Family time is important to a child's development. If a child grows up without seeing their family they won't learn necessary morals and relationships. A family teaches a child almost all that they need to know when it comes to behavior and communicating with others. Family is very important.

If a student wanted extra credit maybe that could be offered to them for doing community service but it should not be mandatory. That would add stress to parents and students alike. Stress could cause a student to not sleep much, be angry or to develop habits like biting there nails. The same applies for the students parent's. If a student doesn't get much sleep how are they going to concentrate and get the grades they normally do. They might even fall asleep during school. They maybe more uptight than usual and lash out at other students. Any result of stress would not be good to the students' health, therefore you shouldn't add to their stress.

9DB6D2ADE58A,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that you should require all students to do community service at least five hours a week. Community service is a good way to teach the students to be responsible and learn to manage their time between school and homework. The students who do the work will learn how much work it takes to keep the community clean and projective. These students will be able to interact with other people that are working in the service with them too. They will be able to take responsibility of their actions. They can also learn new skills depending on the task they take on in the community. Vandals and delinquents who do the services will learn how hard it is to do the tasks and act better out of fears of getting more hours to the service they already have to do .

My friend OTHER_NAME was always acting up in class and causing trouble in or out of school. He just enjoyed being the center of attention because of things he would do or come up with. Later all the things he had caught up with him and he had to serve hours of community service out of it. OTHER_NAME would have to serve a minimum of two hours a day until he does all sixty of his penalized hours. Now he is behaving in class because he learned all those hours of extra work are not worth a couple minutes of laughter. OTHER_NAME has gained more knowledge and responsibility due to all the work he spent paying off his debt and helping all those people. He had to find out the hard way that his were worse than he had. I admire OTHER_NAME for becoming a better student and learning that the way he acted was not the best way.

This is why I urge you to make it a requirement that students serve at least five hour of community service to help out the people who need it. It will help them become better people and learn to be responsible like my friend OTHER_NAME other trouble makers will also learn to be better people. They will be able to learn and give out respect to people when they deserve it. Maybe t they will act out every other while but they will do it less often then they do now without being required to do the work. They will learn to be responsible with how they with use their time and what they do to make those hours every week. The new skills they learn will help them grow as a person and a member of their community. People who don't so their hours should be require to do an extra hours every week until they make it up. These are some reasons why you should make it a requirement to do community work every week.

To begin with, me myself would most definitely love to help others in the task of cleaning our community. If we don't clean our community who will? We must have some respect for our environment. Although we all want to do other things, we must first do what we have to do. Community service is our duty as a citizen and we must do what's right. This is the way I look at it and soon enough it would be the way you look at it as well.

First off as a community we are the only people that would care about our community. It is not as if some one from a different part of town would just come to us and clean our space for us. We must do it on our own. Our community is the one in which we grew up in and i refuse to just allow it to become a wasteland. No one else would care for our community the way we do, or at least the way we should anyway.

Secondly, our community as a whole is one of glory with a little respect, and just as much respect given to us from our community should be returned ten fold. There's no doubt in my mind that our little dumb of a community could be turned into the city of Babylon if not better. All we need to do is treat it with a little respect.

Finally, we could all get a little lazy at one point and I don't mind that, but its that kind of thinking that put us in the need of community service in the first place. Just as you do your chores at home you should do to your home community. It's only fair. The amount of energy a kid has should not go to waste with video games, television, and computers. It should be distributed to the work of our community, and that's all it takes.

Now you wold understand why a person would feel so strongly about something as simple as community service. If everyone felt as deeply as i feel about our community the world would be a better place.",3,Community service,Independent

Imagine the world turning into an immense pile of trash. Community service is required in BETA Club, but I believe that every student in our school should take a stand and help our community by doing service hours. By doing service hours everyone in the school will be able to make new friends, find a way to occupy themselves, and keep our earth clean.

Community services allows many people to interact with others. Our school should require service hours to each and every student because everyone will be able to benefit from this. Whether it is assisting handicap children or picking up trash, the volunteers will be able to communicate with their surrounding. The students will have a friendly connection with everyone who is involved and will be able to complete tasks that are assigned to them. Meeting new people and helping out with our community is always a good feeling.

Finding a real job for teenagers under the age of fifteen is nearly impossible. Some students are able to work for what they strive for and I am determined to create a healthy and welcoming environment for our school. Some students who have a hard time in a certain class should be able to sign up for tutoring. Keeping students occupied with school work will help them in the future. It only takes about fifteen minutes to and hour to complete one community service, depending on the task that is assigned.

I encourage everyone to find a healthy hobby for our community, such has recycling to help keep our planet looking better than ever.

Our Earth is filled with trash on the ground and students who are lazy tend to leave their papers on the floor. The best thing to do is provide service hours for our school so it will look fresh and clean. We shouldn't have to have janitors coming into every classroom and hurting their backs just to clean up our mess. Junior high students should be more responsible and mature enough to pick up our own trash.

Community service is a fun way to help out with the community. I encourage you to require service hours to every student in the school. There is no negative results from this and it won't hurt to help other students with their homework or pick up trash to prevent a mess. Our earth will be clean, we'll be able to find a new friend, and it's a great way to keep us busy.

Although, there are some that have a different view of doing so. the ones that think we shouldn't say it's a waste of time or they don't have time at all to do community service. I think we should do community service because it is helpful to our community, colleges look at those kind of things, and last it will give people better thoughts of what kind of person you might be.

One reason i think we should be required to do community service is because it would help our community. If we done things little like pick up trash on the roads or at the parks it would make our town look clean and less trashy. If all the students in the middle school helped do something in our community, it would help by saving the adults time too. There are so many of us that we could be done in no time as if it were only a dozen people it could take a whole year to get what needed to be done finished. I'm sure our community would really like it if we helped.

When you do community service, it's wrote down and colleges are able to see that.

Most colleges would like to have someone willing to sacrifice their own time to help out. When they see that you have done community service, they might be more eager to consider you at their college. Colleges can be hard to get into and that means you need to do all that you can extra to help you out. You never know when a college is looking at things as little as community service for you a scholarship.

My final reason why I think we should do community service is because people are going to judge you no matter what and if you did a little community service it would make them think you are a good person. If you needed to find a job and you went to a store that the owner saw you doing community work, he might say, ""Hey, this person isn't lazy i think I'll hire them.""

No one wants to be seen as a lazy person and when you're doing things for the community people will see you as a helpful and kind person. Adults look at how you act and what you do to see what kind of kid you are and community service would give them an impression that you're and ok kid. That could mean they would consider their child being friends with you.

Community service can be hard. You have to manage your time, that makes you responsible. Being responsible is something you need to be able to do.

I really think we should be required to do community service.

I was informed that you are deciding whether to require all student to perform community service. I wanted to take the opportunity to talk to you about what i think about this situation.

i think that everyone should be required to do community service at least once a week. i believe that with at least one day that each student does it, it will help the school and our community.

If you approve of this our school will become cleaner and our library will become more organized and the kids from the elementary school would really appreciate if we could lend them a hand. If we all could participate in this program our student will think twice about throwing a piece of wrapper on the floor.

Most student disagree with me because they say that it isn't their responsibility to pick up after someone else. They also say that they don't get anything out of performing community service but i think that if each student does community service that maybe we could raffle a prize out every month or so, so that they could get motivated to do the service. Or maybe for every two hour they do of community service they could get a hour of detention taken off.

I think that with my proposition our student will want to participate in our weekly community service program.

I hope that you make the correct decision, that is best for the school, the district and our community.

I believe that community service is extremely important and that all students should be required to perform some community service. Community service helps out the community a lot, so the students will be making their homes a better place to live and learn. Another thing that community service does is that it helps build character in a child, because they are constantly helping people out and doing the right thing. Next, community service will help with your education, because kids who do community service are more likely to get into a good college. Community service is a key element in our growth and development.

First of all, community service makes the place you live a better place, by creating a better environment to work, learn and live, as well as make everyone happier. The community benefits a lot from kids or adults actively participating in community service. Research shows, that the cleaner and more beautiful the town or city is, the happier the people are. Who is happy when they are living in a trash can? Community service helps clean up the town, by simple things like picking up trash, or larger projects like planting trees. Education also benefits from community service, because we can teach the younger generation skills they need to grow up. Also, a better looking school, would be a better place to learn, because the students will be happier and more motivated.

Secondly, students and adults who perform community service build a lot of character. This is because they are constantly helping people out, and doing the right thing. This way they will feel good about themselves, and will be a better person overall. I am a boy scout, and i always participate in activities such as, help cleaning up a state park, and help cleaning up the Connecticut River. After i do these things, i feel ready good about myself because i did the right thing, and helped out our community a lot. Furthermore, scientist have shown that students who do community service have a better chance of having a happy life than people who don't, because you will always feel good about yourself and how you have helped your community.

Another reason that community service is very important, is because many ivy league colleges, and other colleges in general, are always looking for people who regularly participate in community service and also volunteer. I personally knew a person, who didn't have all A's in school, and didn't get a great score on the SAT's, but she was an volunteer at a hospital and part of a organization that helps homeless people. She got accepted into Harvard University because she did all that community service. Community service helps out a lot in our lives, by both building character and also it helps tremendously in applying for college. In addition, it also helps a lot with our education, because last year we won our regional science bowl, because some high school students decided to help out our them and come to our practices to teach us. This was very helpful for us and we benefited a lot because of that. They probably also felt better about themselves that they were teaching the younger generation and helping us out. People don't know how much you can learn from kids older than you. you can probably learn more from them than teachers, because you look up to them and respect them the same or maybe more than your teachers. So community service is extremely in education.

In conclusion, I believe that community service helps out a lot with our growth and development, either by education, or building character. Both of those are super important in our life. Studies show that people who do community service are 3 times more likely to succeed than people who don't. And the community benefits from these acts too, because you are making your town a happier and better place to live. So please take my opinion into account, and make all the students do some community service.      ",5,Community service,Independent

I Think that the students at SCHOOL_NAME should perform community service. I think this because not only will it help our community but it will also help our student body become better people. For example it will tech our students responsibility. In addition it will also teach our students how to care for others and not just for themselves. Finally it will also teach them how to have patients with others. All of this is better for the students. Community service can also be fun.

Community service can teach our students how to be responsible. For example if the student is scheduled to go somewhere to help out with something it will show them that being on time is a crucial part of their job. Also if a student is doing community service by babysitting a child it will show them how to take care of someone and being able to help. Another example of how community service can make a student responsible is when the student is asked to do something they need to do it. This will come in handy at school with turning in assignments on time and putting in hard work.

Community service will teach the students to care for others and not just for themselves. For example if a student is babysitting it will show them how to care for an infant or even a toddler. Also it will help teach students care by showing that if someone needs help doing something that he or she will help and not just stand there and watch. Doing community service can also show care for others by picking up trash in unwanted areas. These are all examples of how doing community service can help students care for others.

Doing community service can also teach them how to have patients with others. For example if a student is asked to do a lot of things it will help them realize that helping others is no such a bad thing and that its good to help others. Another example of how it teaches patients is when a student is babysitting a child and the child will not go to sleep the student can read a book with the child and eventually the child will get tired and fall asleep. These are all examples of how doing simple community service can help a student become a better person.

In this letter I showed you examples of how doing community service teaches responsibility, teaches students how to care for others, and how it helps students have more patients. I hope that you choose to require the student body to do community service because i feel that if you do make them work it will really show them how much they can help change themselves to become better.

Over the years, your students having been growing up and maturing.

You have helped us do this, but now, it is our turn to make our own decisions.

I believe we should not be required to take part in community service.

Your students work hard throughout the school year with not only class work but with home activities and several others that may require our time.

We should be able to take part in community service at our own free will.

Not as a requirement.

At home, we as students may have several older brothers or sisters.

Our parents work hard to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table for all the siblings to share.

The least we can do is stay home to watch after everyone, but there would be less time to do that if we have to do community service.

It is time consuming for other important things like house hold chores and adding memories to our siblings lives by being there for them.

We are your children.

You have watched us grow and tumble through hard situations.

We do not want to want to do something if you made it a requirement.

We need the freedom of making that choice for ourselves if it is or is not something we want to do.

Life is full of choices.

What to wear in the morning or what to watch on television?

These are both things we decide every day.

Now, this is our decision to either help or not.

You will be taking our right away to make our own decisions if you make community service a requirement.

You have taken your students through leaps and bounds, but now, your students will prove to you that we can make our own decisions including the decision to take part in community service.

Our time is occupied by hard class work and extra curricular activities.

At home, there may have to help and stay home due to the family.

We want to be free to make the decision, but we don't want to participate because it was required to do so.

We are free to make the choice of participating in community service.",3,Community service,Independent

Your idea about all students having to do community service is a wonderful idea. Now of days people just throw stuff on the ground thinking its not a big deal, but it is. If all people do is just throw garbage on the streets it will make the Earth look like a garbage dump. It is also bad for our environment. Animals eating it thinking its food and choking to death. Then if people throw it into the water the fish die from it. If students get involved it'll make the world or there town cleaner. then plants, and animals won't die from the waste that comes from the garbage. if you want students to do community service I'm okay with this idea. I'm sure all the other students would be fine with this to.

I also have another idea on getting them to do so. give the assignments as homework. Each day you assign the assignment make this the only homework you give them so they would do it. By doing this it'll give them something to do that doesn't require having to think. It'll also make them like recycling and helping the environment.

In conclusion, I believe making students do community service is a good idea.

Some of my friends perform community service, but my other friends think it just waste of time. I am supporting that the principal should require students to perform community service. This is a great way to show to the community that you care. Students should know that community service is very important. Community service helps you and your community.

There are many reasons why students should perform community service. Performing community service helps your community and other communities. Your community will be cleaner and fresh. Not just students but everyone in this country should have community service. When your community is full with trash. No one will care, but you can make a change. You will need a helping hand to help you with community service.

In streets, public places, and school campus, there are people littering. If you care about your community, you should gather people to help you clean it. Even if the trash is not yours, pick it up. It is not just picking up trash. There are planting trees, etc. So, when you are done picking up the trash, you could continue planting trees and flowers. To make it stand out.

All students should perform community service because that will help out the community, our planet, and us. Not all students care about keeping our community clean and helping others, but if they are required to do it they don't have a choice. I support you with the idea of all students to perform community service.

First of all not all students care if our community is clean or not. They don't really like doing community service because they don't get paid to help out. But if they were required to do community service then they wouldn't have a choice. Which then our community would be clean so when purists came they will like to come back again. If i were to go somewhere and there was trash on the streets and was really dirty I wouldn't like to go back to that place.

Secondly doing community service would also help our planet. If we keep our community clean and recycle then we wouldn't be throwing away so much garbage. Recycling is very important but not everyone does it. If we were to do community service we would personally go to peoples houses and ask if they had things to recycle. That way if they don't have time to go recycle there things well take them.

Thirdly community service isn't just about cleaning its about helping others to. For example tutoring elementary students, taking care of them when there's a meeting at school, or organizing a fund razer. Some kids don't have older siblings to help them with there homework so we could go help. Also when there's meetings at schools but the parents bring there children but are too busy taking care of them that they hardly pay attention. If we were to go help we could take care of them and do fun activities with them. Another thing is we could organize a fund razer of food so when the holidays come and those who don't have family could have a dinner.

To sum things up having all students perform community service if a great idea and i would like to do it. Sometimes i just go home after school and just watch television when instead i could be doing something for my community to make it look better and help those in need. I think you should require all student to perform at least 5 hours of community service before passing grade.

Community service is a good thing. Some people do it just because it is a good and nice and civil thing to do. We also know some is for the fact that people just can't stop getting in trouble. Now i am all for it, but also maybe a little against the fact that you think all students should be required to do it.

Some of my reasons for this is because not all people are like that. Yes it is a very good thing, but some students may not just have the time. Especially Middle school or High school students. Some get into a lot of activities. For example: football, basketball, wrestling, speech, student counsel, SCHOOL_NAME, and more. There are just so many thing that kids do now a days. Requiring them to do more is just and outrage. And that is the truth. Believe me i do see what you are getting at here and i see the big picture. It is just not right though.

Maybe if i looked at it from your view i might see it a different way but I'm not. I know that all that you want to do is maybe give the students more discipline and maybe prepare or show them what life is or life will be like if you go down the wrong path. I understand, but that still doesn't make it right. If someone ends up there well so be it. You can't stop that but why make kids especially our age do something that we don't need to and have no business doing. That is grown adults stuff. Not kid/teenager stuff, if you wanted us to be adults I'm pretty sure you would've asked us.

Sir all that i am asking you here is to look over your options and think bout what you are doing. Think about the children's wants and needs. Think about whether you would want to or not and how it would make you feel. Maybe think of a way to get boys and girls on board or you can maybe set aside a day or two for maybe field trip or a cleaning day for your school and/or your community. Still keep it nice just don't make the kids bitter in the process.

I strongly agree that students should take charge and start making a difference in their life! You should make it required for students to perform community service and help out the people in need of a helping hand.

Now days many kids don't realize how fortunate they are to have a roof over their heads and food to eat! They don't realize that there are people out there who are struggling just to bring food home to their loved ones! These kids think that sitting on the couch playing video games is important. Well look at those kids who can't afford these gaming systems. Instead of playing, they're out their working their butts off at age 7! If those kids can get off their butts and start working, the people who just sit on their butts all day can take some time off and help those people. One hour won't hurt you; there's a whole other day for you to catch up on things.

Helping people makes you feel good on the inside. Just knowing that you did a good deed for someone in need warms your heart because you know they appreciated every second of it. If your smart and good at teaching someone, go help out the younger kids who need help on their homework. You can tutor little kids after school or pick up litter on the schools campus. These little things that students can do will make a huge difference on the way we look at life today. The students who are doing community service deserve a round of applause for giving up their time and putting in all their effort to start making a difference in this world. They are the ones who are going to be ruling this world in the future and making this world a better place.

Doing community service also looks good on college applications. If they found out how many times you've done community service they will always think twice about your application. This may get more students into college to start a career and get on move on with their life.

It's not only about feeling good about yourself, but making others feel good that you were there when they needed a helping hand. For these reasons, I agree that you should make it required for students to perform community service.",4,Community service,Independent

I don't think u should make the students of our school do community service because that will take away there time if its after school or there learning time if its during school. it would also be to hard to make all of the students of the school to do that the school could use its time to help the school. Even though it helps the community out by making it a cleaner and safer place the students should have a choice in what they want to do for their community.

If we had to do community service during school it would take time away from our learning and the students need as much time as they can in school to learn what they are doing so they can pass tests and pass the grade. If it was after school it could take time away from the students doing their homework, because most of the students have to do their homework after school and help clean their house. If they are in a sport also they wouldn't have enough time to help the community if it was mandatory.

It would also be to much work to try and monitor all of the students that are at the school to make them do community service.

Community service means to make your community a better place then it was before! I think all schools should have a community service program. I mean would you want some people come from china and ""say o man this place is a dump lets get out of here ?"" Cause i know i wouldn't! Just think if you ever went and did some community service everyone would like you for cleaning the community ! If i had community service i would need some help !

So go out and encourage a friend or two , and tell them what it would be like ! Yes it would take some time out of your life, but its for a good cause ! Homeless People do community service and they don't even have a home to go to after word ! But if your worried about what other people or even friends think of you then obviously their not a true friend ! A true friend would go out and be by your side helping to make Yours and others a better community !

Even if your community service is only at school that's okay too, teachers always need help at school !! You can baby sit some kids, clean up litter , tutor some little kids n elementary school , ! See community service isn't all about cleaning or picking up trash its about doing something different You can recycle , you can throw and separate your trash into different trash cans to help the economic!

Just the other day i was with a friend and his grandmother, and we were in the car driving down the road and the next thing i know , someone's car breaks down in the middle of the street and we help them! It was a woman and her son and she just picked up her son from school , and we had to push their car back to a store and we took them home !

yes it was tough to push a car but as soon as we started pushing all together we finally got it to start moving and after we started to get it to move more people came and helped after everyone started to help ,it was like a piece of cake After that day i was excited to help someone out their that needed help !

So go out their help someone you know that needs help or even maybe clean your yard up?

If you ask some friend to help i am sure enough that they will go and help you out ! Well , what are you waiting on ? Go!

I am a concerned student body member of your school. I have heard that you are debating whether or not to make it mandatory that all students perform community service acts. I personally do community service, and I would like to weigh in on the opinion. I have to go against it, not because it isn't right, but because it is unfair. I think that if you maybe offer the choice for students to work community service hours and offer extra credit towards school in return then you will be more fair.

To demand students to attend community service after school hours is outrageous. This would be unfair because you do not know what is going on in their life at that time. Someone in their family can be sick and in the hospital or maybe they have to attend a family meeting that they committed to. Whatever the case this would be unfair to them. I think that to some students this would be like detention because of the required after school hours, and having to come would be mandatory.

A suggestion would be to force the ones in detention to do community service. This would make them feel bad about what they did, and you could help clean up the school by having them pick up trash. Even though they would be doing community service, they would also be doing good for the community or our school. If others feel that they want to stay after to help with community service then maybe you could offer extra credit in return.

As I mentioned before, I myself perform acts of community service. I would not like to be recognized and one of your students who has to do community service. I would instead like to be recognized as one of you students who wants to do service. I like the sense of accomplishment when I help someone get something done, and you forcing me to do it would completely take that away. I would rather choose to do community service than have you make me.

I can get what you are trying to say when you want us to all do community service. It would give our school a good reputation, and would make you feel better. Some students might be up for the challenge, but others won't come or wouldn't do a good job. I think that is almost cruel to force children to work. Even if it is for the good of the community. Like I said before, some children may not have the time to stay after school and do work because of issues at home. Maybe a good alternative would be to let kids do work around school durring the school day instead of after school.",4,Community service,Independent

I do not think that you should require kids to do community service.

I believe that forcing kids to do that will not make them feel good about what they are doing.

Make them realize that they would want help if it were them that was in need.

Also, they should not have to do community service because it will cause fights and gangs to form.

So, with that said, I believe that you should not require kids to do any community service.

I do not think that you should require kids to do community service because it will not allow the kids to feel good about what they are doing.

It will also not allow them to realize that they are making someone else no that people are willing to help them.

This will make others feel bad that they are not helping others.

Then they will start doing community service and soon the school will be doing it on their own without you forcing them to do it.

So you should not make them do community service if they don't want to and make them want to do it on their own.

Another reason is that if they don't want to than they don't have to.

If you force them to do it than it will cause fights in the school.

Their will be gangs and they will always be fighting and it will be all because you wanted them to do some community service.

Nobody will be safe and the school will have to be shut down because their are not enough kids in school because you suspended or expelled them.

If you do make kids do community service, than you will be in trouble because a bunch of kids will be all screw you principle.

So, if you do make kids do community service, than you and the school will be in trouble.

Some people might think that it is a good idea because it will make kids feel good about themselves.

And that they will start doing community service on their own.

But I say, if they like it so much, than you should never have had to make them do it in the first place.

Many kids already do community service on their own and you should not have to force us to do it.

So even though it is kind of a good idea, kids will still get mad and maybe even threaten you.

Kids should not have to do community service if they don't want to.

They should be able to do it on their own and feel good about what they just did.

It will cause fights and gangs to come after you and each other.

It will cause nothing but fights in the school.

Students should not have to perform community service as the other willing students or teachers. Simply because we do not make the mess so why should we have to clean it up. It does take time away from what we have to do ,or time we have to spend with loved ones, and family. People are made to pick up trash they're garbage men not ten and eleven year olds. Schools are for education not humiliation. No one wants to pick up someone else's trash or dirty works on the road or in public. People have to do that on Probation or while they're in jail. We are kids not slaves, or some governments workers. They hire people to pick up trash and keep the community clean. So that must mean that they pay people for no reason and lose money while they have no money at all. We can choose weather we want to pick up trash or not. All im trying to say is that their is no fun in what that has to do with and kids want to have fun. Adults like our parents can make that decision and make us not the school and with all respect not you.

I'm writing you this letter to inform you that students should not be required to do community service because not all kids have all the time in the world to pick up other peoples trash, and also because not all students want to be picking up trash because either they have stuff to do with their families at home or maybe friends, or because it is boring, and because there either in sports or a school club. I don't think students should be required to do community service because it is not there job to pick up liter from the city streets because there are more important things to do then that like doing homework, school work, or maybe they have a job or something but mainly because a lot of students do not want to community service, this is why I'm informing you that students should not be required to do community service during after school activities or clubs.

If the community was to be cleaned more, we would have more fresh and less dangerous air. If we made the community to stop being dangerous less people would die. There are many criminals out that the police have not found out about yet.

If many people would volunteer, other people that already have jobs would not need to or be forced to get a job someone already has. By volunteering, people that need jobs could help the community by picking up trash or helping serve food at special occasions.

Volunteering would get people into being active instead of watching tv all day.

The people who would volunteer could meet nicer people and have them help out with more community problems that other people would need help with in the world. Volunteers could help with supporting people by earning money for homeless.",2,Community service,Independent

You should require all students to perform community service because not only does it protect the environment it protects future generations and our community. For example say people were not taking care of the environment and throwing their garbage and littering in our rivers and streams, which leads to our drink water it would then be contaminated and the contamination of the water wouldn't just effect humans it would effect plants and animals as well. Or say that we were not recycling, all of our garbage would do straight to landfill's which would once again put humans, plants and animals in danger. Or perhaps we were letting the oil from our cars run out into streams and driving our car to places that we could easily walk to or letting the carbon monoxide from our cars pollute the air leaving more of a chance for global warming to happen.

All of this can be prevented if we just take thirty minutes out of our day and pick up loose trash in our neighborhood or park or just as simple as recycling plastics, papers, cardboards, glasses etc. Also students want have to worry about taking time away from hanging out with their friends because their friends can do it with them and they would be getting more done in half of the time. This plan will work if you put it into action and I strongly hope you take my request into recommendation.

I strongly agree that students should take a position in community service. I agree because everyone should want to live in a safe environment and if we don't stand up and clean up our communities who will.

I don't only think that students should do community service but adults should also. Another reason why we should perform community service is because it may be your little brother or sister that may need tutoring . For those of you who don't think you should participate in these services your wrong.

Community services are not just time consuming, it serves its purpose.

It isn't like your doing it just to be doing it, your actually helping someone. I know that the person appreciates what your doing because your taking your time to help the and that shows a lot.

These are my reasons why people should enjoy and take some time out of their day to help someone because one day you may need help and the person you said no to might turn out to be the person that helps you.

Students in our school should take part in community service. I think students should take part in community service because they could help tutor elementary school children, clean up liter left by others, or volunteer in food shelters. This is a great way to help the environment, the people and children.

One great way by taking part in the community service is helping tutor elementary school kids. This can help the little ones learn more and get higher grades. People at our school could volunteer in this event by helping every Monday and Thursday after school hours. They would meet up with the elementary school kids and tutor them in subjects such as reading, math, science, or social studies.

Another great way to take part in community service is by cleaning up liter left by others in the park or school grounds. This would help keep our environment clean. Students could sign up for this opportunity by joining a club. They would help clean up liter on free days during the week.

Another amazing way to take part in community service is by volunteering in food shelters. The students could help doing this by bringing food to the shelters and feeding the food to the ones in need of food.

Helping in community service would not take away much time away from what they want or need. People could do it during their free time. Students should take part in this excellent opportunity because it's going to help the community. Students should be required to perform in community service because it helps the environment. Helping the community is very important. Anyone in the community should help in tutoring elementary school children, cleaning up liter, or helping in food shelters because it's a great thing to do.

You are in the middle of a very important decision, the decision to make community service required or not. I believe you should make community service required. There are many students who enjoy doing community service but there are those who do not want to help out. We should inspire them to help.

If you mandate community service, people will do it but some of them will do it with disgust. Those students will make sure that you know they don't want to do it. Athletic types may not have the time help out in the community. I know that sounds bad, but a dedicated basketball player would most likely not turn down a game for cleaning in the community.

That's why we need to require it and give them opportunities to help out.

On the other hand, if you were to oblige community service we would have a cleaner community. We also would have a more united community. It would be united because students would work together so it would be more fun. Also you could only require us to do community service 24 hours a school year. Another option is to require it in monthly terms. You could require 2 hours of community service a month and if you went with that option, you should give a list of ideas.

All in all, I would like to see our school do more for the community. I would support your decision to require our student body to do community service. Also you could put together a community clean-up club for those who want to get the service done with their friends. I would recommend a minimum of 2hours a month. I believe that is enough time to walk several dogs in our community shelter. Also 2 hours is enough to read stories to elementary students. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you make a decision that will improve our school, community, and nation for the better.

Community service, good or bad. I know your trying to decide if community service should be a requirement or not. During this letter I hope to tell you some reasons why it should be a requirement and some reasons why not. I hope this letter answers your problem.

There are many benefits to community service, for one your helping someone in the community ever time you pick up a pop can or take 15 minutes to help a neighbor or fellow classmate with home work he might not understand. Community service is a way to make a difference, but its something you want to do not have to. If you do community service because you want to then you get to feel the reward and how good it feels to help someone besides yourself. If you have to do it you don't get to feel any of that also if you don't want to do it then you probably won't do you best or even enjoy it.

At the same time there are times we need to help the community, if the community is in a time of need and can't hire people to clean up the streets you should step in an help. A community is should be a place to feel safe and a place to enjoy being in, but you can't do either of those things if you step on a can ever step you take. You should take pride in your community and keep it clean especially if it is the only one you got.

What kind of people do community service? People who want to or people who have to. Also when they do it who does a better job? Have you ever been going down the high way and seen men and women in orange jump suites cleaning up the high way. They get the job done but not very well. Also have you drove down the high way and seen young boys and girls in green suites cleaning up the highway for fun. These pride students love to help the community and they do a good job at it that's why you shouldn't have do community service you, you should do it because you want to.

This was my letter telling why community service is a good thing just not a thing we should have to do. Were students not criminals. You should take pride in your work and help the community but not have to.

I ,as a SCHOOL_NAME Student, think that having community work should be required. Community work will help not just the community but will also help your self. Doing a little help for the community is not something that should just be thought of as not important. It should be something that people like to do, I mean its your community the place were you live, why wouldn't you want your city to look as great as any other place.

Being a student here makes me proud to be who I am. Helping the community out is nothing to pay for just being here at this school. Without a community this school would not be here, even if it was no one wants to go to some dirty and totally nasty school. Why would you want that, when if every one helps out for just a little while your community would look great and then every one would want to go to your school or your community to live in, meaning more jobs, more money, and more families.

Now I can see why someone would say, ""Help out the community, why would I do that. I have better things to do. That's why they have jobs to clean the city."" Well that is true, but I say that if no one was to help the community why would any one want to come to a place were every is to lazy to help out the community. Which in turn will have people, say like your neighbor, who will need your help with something like putting up Christmas lights up, and you might just say no and say to hire someone to do it for you. The community is a place of friends and families growing up together, not fighting each other.

This is why I, STUDENT_NAME, say that the principle should have community service required. This is something that keeps the community together, friends who work together for a very happy community!

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I go to SCHOOL_NAME. I am writing this letter to you because I wanted to tell you about my idea about community service, if all students should perform community service or not. I do not think that all students should perform community service. I think that it should be up to the parents. Or an extra curriculum activity after school hours or even before school hours. You could even give it to the kids that miss behave in school.

I think that the parents should be in charge of there kid in what to do, such as community service. If the child wants to do community service then let the student do community service. If they think that there children needs or even wants to be in community service then they could do it. I don't think it would be far to the kids who need to spend more time on there study's or even children that already have after school sports.

An extra curriculum activity would be good also for the students. It may want more kids to go and do community service. I think that alot more kids would come to community service if it was an extra curriculum activity. Also if there parents new about it i think the parents would want there kids to be participating in community service. It would also be a good way for desaplan actions. For students.

Although not ever student is a good at paying attention to the teacher. why don't we give students community service instead of detention or worse. although it would be up the parents and the student in pick of witch he/she would rather do. community service would be the same amount of hours as detention just a shorter period of time.

I hope this will convince your mind into not having every student in the school do community service. Also maybe putting it to use like an extra curriculum. Or even letting kids have there pick in what to do between community service or detention. Thank you for reading this letter and please consider my ideas.

TEACHER_NAME,

I take the position on how students should be required to perform community service. The kids say they have better things to do or they have no time, but the obviously have enough time to watch television or go on the internet. So they should be required to do community service. You could require a certain amount of hours per month, year, or even week. This way they know how much time they have to perform so they can make time. Also the community service sounds like it takes a lot of effort, but it really doesn't if you actually do it for a certain amount of time.

Many students have recess or core plus or extra time in their school day because i used to have core plus and it would be useless when there was no activity to do. Well you could give the teachers work or some ideas and have the students do some community service to fill in hours or any another requirement. Putting community service in a students everyday schedule will be adjusted because its another requirement in school that they can achieve. If the students do the service it will pay off in maybe a reward or another prize of some sort. This way students will actually perform the service with more effort. Giving the students requirements will make them participate in community service, and i know that there is at least a half an hour in everybody's day.

Another reason why students should be required to participate in community service is because it makes our community a better place. Maybe picking up trash on the side of the school or roads near the school could help our community. Or helping the disabled students in our school could be counted as community service because it help our society. Taking the time to help other people or our environment or even our school can come in big rewards. To get students started on the job, the service should be required. On small step can lead to big achievements.

Thank you for your time.

C50CDD1C35B2,"I think that it's very important to help the community and I know some people think that to help the community takes too much time or they want to do something different.

But I think that everybody need to help and maybe it would be good to perform community service, so I think we should try to help more, and to do something that it's good for us and that help our school.

We should do more good things for our school. Maybe it's not fun but everybody need to help in something, we have to do more important things for our school ant to learn that it's good to help the community.

maybe it takes time away from what people need or want to do, but is not fair that some people perform community service and others don't perform community service cause we need to help too.

For example in the story that some SCHOOL_NAME elementary school children and others clean up litter, I think that it's good for the kids of the school to learn how to help the community because is very important.

So if some kids of others schools perform community service well

I think we should try and if that works it would be really good for our school.

But sometimes the students need to do other things and they can't perform community service well I think that the principal should ask them to know it they can.

A486E99E277D,"Dear School Principal,

Community Service is an amazing idea! I believe that more kids should participate in community service. People think that community service is something you have to do when you get in trouble. That is probably why not all students participate in different types of community service. In my opinion, you should create forms stating that everyone in the school is required to do community service, and below list a few small things that they could choose from.

I think community service is very important in many cases. For example, people cleaning up the sides of the roads could help keep our town clean. Another example would be, students reading to younger students could improve the older students reading skills, and help the younger kids understand different things. Students who volunteer for community service are trying to help and make sure the town stays in shape, even if they aren't doing much. They are also being amazing role models for the younger students, who would one day want to participate in community service. Students could participate in anything from reading to younger students to cleaning up the local parks and roads. They just have to find something they enjoy doing. Anything could improve our town, but sitting at home can not.

I think most students do not want to participate in these types of things because, they are just embarrassed or are not willing to help people out. There are many things you can do for community service and they will find something they like! You just have to push them to get started. That is all they really need, is a little push start. If you require community service more students around that area will want to participate, like children from other schools. Eventually it will spread and everyone in the area will be participating in different community service activities. Hopefully, by you starting this we could get people outside of our district to participate, but we have to start it. I believe that you should require students to participate in community service. I think it will help our town tremendously! We could also get people all over North Carolina to participate if we try. I hope you consider my letter, and mention this to other principals around the district.

Many people believe it is appropriate to take care of our community.

Whether it is helping someone in need, or picking up a couple of cans off the side of the road.

Although some people think that this is a great opportunity to make our community a better place, some people find it as being a waste of time.

They don't see the importance of community service.

I find it very important to help out in my community.

Every little gesture of kindness is great!

In my opinion, the people who don't want to help out, are selfish.

They would rather spend time benefiting themselves than to benefit others.

It is also a sign of laziness.

What people don't understand, is that helping out in our community is fun, and if its the right kind of job, it will earn you credits if you are in Honors Society!

If you are not in honors society, it just might be on a college application!

Having community service on there might get recognized when it comes to finding a job these days.

So TEACHER_NAME, I think you should require all students to perform community service.

It could be a great way to help our children in school(if they are tutoring), making our community look nicer(by planting flowers, trees, etc.), and to teach them respect for their community.

This could be beneficial to everyone here in Brunswick County.

But why stop there?

Spread the word!

I think that we should all do community service. When we perform community service we help our community. I cant think of a reason why you would want to stop helping the community. Considering the fact that its our community and if we don't clean it and help the people in it no one will. So eventually our community will have to be shut down . Then were would we live and wouldn't you feel guilty knowing your the reason we have to shut down the community and move somewhere else. I know I would feel absolutely horrible, because a lot of people don't have the money to move.

We should also do community service just for the good of it. There is no better feeling in the world than knowing you did a good deed or helped someone. We could help by going into the classes and helping the younger kids so the teachers can get more work done and wont have to work overtime. We could also help pick up litter and trash on the side off the road so other people don't have to do it instead they can spend time with their family.

We shouldn't be absorbed in the stuff that we personally want to do because this stuff needs to be done its not just something we want to be done. This is so much more important then getting to watch television or play your video game because when you do this you actually accomplish something. You may say well if i don't watch this show i wont get to accomplish finishing the season or i just accomplished getting to the next level in this video game. But those are just little accomplishments that only matter to you and maybe your friends. Accomplishing community service matter to a lot more people and is more important.

Well its important to help the community service because if we don't our city might be dirty and not clean and sometimes our city is very dirty cause some people just throw trush in the floor and that's why we always have to keep our city clean so we don't have to have our city dirty. Sometimes my friends don't like helping the community service because she doesn't care but i tell her its important to help the community because if we don't we just might not have water, food, etc. When my OTHER_NAME was here in whittier she sometimes take me to the park and pick up trash from the floor and throw it on the trash can or sometimes she takes me to go and check in the trash can to see if there is cans so we could recycle it.

After when me and my OTHER_NAME was at the park picking up the trash we saw these two guys that were throwing food on the floor and I told my OTHER_NAME look those guys are throwing food on the floor so when they left I went and picked up what they threw on the floor cause its important to help the community service. Also sometimes I go to compton and there is a lot of trash on the floor and when I always go over there with my cousin I always take a bag so i could pick up the trash and food that they have on the floor.

Some of my friends perform community service, for example, some tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter. I do not think we should have to do this unless we wanted to. For example, there are many things that some kids might have to do at home. There could be: homework, chores, or even babysitting. This could take a while and put stress on us if we had to do community service. We have things that we need to do, and we want to do. Therefore, I do not think we should be required to do any kind of community service unless we volunteered. An example of myself not having time is: I have to wash my dogs every afternoon, I have to do many chores, and babysit my younger sister until my parents get off of work, I have to do my homework, and take a shower. Some things that I would like to do is: watch TV, listen to music, go walking, or ride bicycles. If I had to perform community service every afternoon, or even once or twice a week, I would have no time to do what I want and need to do. For example, I go to school everyday. I get out of school, and ride the bus home and get home at 3:30 P.M. every afternoon. My father doesn't get off of work until 7:00 P.M., and my mother doesn't get off until 7:30 or 8:00 P.M.I have a younger sister, that's five years old in preschool. She has to be with me at all times until my parents get off of work. I couldn't carry her with me to do community service because she's young and she gets into everything. Another example is: washing all three of my dogs every afternoon. That probably takes about an hour or an hour and a half. Homework usually takes about an hour, and taking out the garbage, washing dishes, cleaning my room, sweeping the house, watering and feeding the dog, cleaning my bunny cage, mopping and dusting usually takes probably about another two hours. I would like to be able to do all of that, and watch TV and ride bicycles or something everyday. This would take up most of my time. Please consider about thinking of all of this and realizing not all children have time to do this, and most of us don't want to do this either. Thank you.

I believe Community Service should never be something that is forced upon students or anyone. It is meant to be volunteer work, children who enjoy it should be the only ones doing it, and children who are forced probably wont want to do it to begin with and their help wont actually be helping anyone.

Community service was designed for a volunteer help if the students are forced it would defeat the purpose of what the service really is. When someone is forced to do something there may not be room for those who are actually interested in helping someone in need or cleaning up the streets. Especially when it comes to helping elderly you don't want some kid who doesn't even know how to take care of himself to have the life of an elderly person in their hands.

Also, when a child wants to do community service to help out others they might not be able to if there are already so many people doing it when it is required for school. Kids who are not having a good time doing it are going to take up the space for someone who actually does. The actual work being done may not be done with the amount of skill or love that someone who enjoys it will have, like cooking.

It is commonly known that, when a child is being required to help someone or clean up garbage they are going to be very frustrated, leading to a worse done job. On the other hand when you have a happy free spirited child who just wants to help people his/her work will be much, much better than the frustrated kid who would rather be home sleeping, than be out working. also there are criminals who are forced to do this as well and they do a similar thing, so the evidence shows.

In conclusion, children, or anyone who actually want to be helping, should be the ones helping. It is meant to be set up like this, A kid who doesn't want to do it shouldn't be doing it, and Children who are forced will do a worse job on the service itself. This is why I advise you not to force children into volunteering for foundations they don't even want to be a part of.

In representation for the school i think community service should not be required. I think community service should not be required because, there are a lot of things kids do outside of school that contribute to their lifestyle. For example some students are in sports and community service would cut into their time being able to practice or go to games. However some students may like the idea of community service. I think that community service should be added as an extracurricular activity to those who wish to participate in it. There are many pros and cons of required community service. For example some cons are that community service could be cutting back in peoples family time or as mentioned earlier cutting in to peoples time to participate in athletic activities. There may just be some students who do not wish to participate in community service and as result may transfer schools reducing good and bad test scores. Although some pros include meeting knew people and helping serve our community. I think until further notice community service should be an optional activity and not required for the better of some students and the school.

I do think that all students should be required to perform community service. I feel strongly this way because it helps make our community a better environment and a more friendly place to live. Also, by doing this, it would decrease the obesity rate in children because instead of playing video games, watching TV, surfing the internet, texting, or even reading, the children would be helping their environment and staying active. By doing so, you are also keeping people more healthy and providing this new way of life (for some people) to be a fun project- depending on what the service is. But even if this service is not pleasant, the students are still giving back to their community and staying active- two very important things in life! If they develop this healthy and caring lifestyle now as children, chances are more than likely that as adults they will still be healthy and caring. Besides this, it is also making a change in the world- no matter how big or small of an impact it makes right now, in the big scheme of things, it will make a change in someone's life; whether that life is human, animal or nature. Life is a valuable thing and people shouldn't waste it wanting this, that, and more; But rather giving back to the community.

I believe that students should be able to do community service for several reasons.

The students should want to help the community. Such as do things for the elderly people, shoveling snow, or mowing peoples lawns.

If the students do community service, then I believe it will keep them from doing bad or dangerous things.

If a student is always busy doing stuff that will help others they do not have time to go smoke, drink, or anything else that is bad.

Although if they were out running around doing stuff they think would be alright, there is more of a chance of them doing something bad.

Another reason, if students do community service, their will be more of a job opportunity if they add community service in their interview with the boss.

When students are doing community service, they could build houses for homeless people to live in.

If there is community service going on then we will have an overall better community to be living in.

It seems to me that community service could clean up towns all around the county.

If one school would start letting their students do community service, other schools would have to let their students doing it too.

Before we know it the whole country will be cleaner than it has ever been.

I don't believe that students should be required to perform any community service hours. If it is not something that they want to do then why make them?

I believe that all students should not be required to perform community service. it destroys our rights as citizens of the united states and it will feel like a punishment for students that will not like to do it. You can not force upon the student to do community service because if they wish not to do it then you will see a lack of effort from them regardless. Instead of forcing the students to clean the litter and all the things you would like for us to do, how about you just encourage us to make sure that we are not doing these things.

Community services is not mandatory so why would we have to do community services if we wish not to. If you put a student in community service that does not want to do it then they wont do as good of a job has you will expect, so why force it on them, just encourage to pick up litter and all those things. Helping the community is very important but why does it have to mean to destroy our rights as a citizen of this country. Believe that i do know where you are coming from i just think that it is a bad idea for our student that wish not to perform community services. That is why I Think that all students should be force to do community services.

F5FA868674D9,"Community service is important in the world because it helps support ideas like cleaning up our neighborhood to helping the needy. If we didn't have community service, the world may not be a place like it is today. But, everyone has to consider that it is a persons preference to choose to do community service and that they are not forced to do it. Our principal may be doing a good deed in saying that everyone should have to do a certain number of hours of community service, but some people may not be able to and they shouldn't be forced to do any work that they don't have to. So i believe that the principal of my school shouldn't make this rule about community service.

One of the reasons that i think that his rule shouldn't be passed is because community service is important but it's only volunteer work that you should volunteer for and not have to be forced to do it. This is because i know from experience how hard it is to keep up with school work and how stressful sports, school, and family can be for a kid my age. Adding community service to this is not a good idea because i think that it may cause unneeded stress on stressed out kids that may not have the time to do this community service. so i believe that community service should not be forced upon kids of all ages.

Another reason that i think forced community service is a bad idea is because it may cause a drawback in education for kids. This is because kids study after school and do homework and are over their heads in homework sometimes and community service may lead to more missing homework and lower grades on tests and quizzes, especially during the end o the marking period when the quarterly assessments are the most important and also the biggest test out of all of them. Community service would not be a good choice for the students at SCHOOL_NAME because of these reasons.

The final reason that i think forced community service is not a good idea is because kids need sleep. Without sleep, kids would do horrible in school and wouldn't be able to keep themslves awake. this would lead to drops in grades and would also lead to poor behavior in school because of lack of sleep. The reason community service may alter sleeping habits is because some communtiy service may require extra time in the evening which would keep the workers up late at night depriving them of sleep, which would be very bad. Community service would not be a good idea for SCHOOL_NAME because it would affect so many aspects of childrens lives.

Community service would leave children in many downfalls for many aspects of their lives because it may add unneede stress that may cause harm or even change them forever \. so this rule should not be passed in SCHOOL_NAME",5,Community service,Independent

Many people deal with the daunting task of community service. I for one believe that community service shapes our world and makes it a better place . I do community service and there is opportunity's for everyone , whatever they may like. It doesn't have to be your hole life ,but you can certainly spend a good amount of time on it. Our future is in our hands get ready for us to shape it.

We as kids, teens, or young adults have are the future of our community. We are going to live here for the rest of our lives we will need to make changes that we would made for our self's. If you want to eliminate drugs in your community then you should start a mentor program for kids and young adults. I believe that we can and will change the future of this planet because only us can make this world a better place.

I love to work with animals. So as my personal community servicer I volunteer at my local animal shelter. Anybody can find a volunteer opportunity in whatever area they like most. For example if you like cars work at a place that fix's cars in the community. I think we should enforce the rule of community service because we can and will make a difference.

The service doesn't have to be your whole life. It can be a couple hours a week or a couple days a week. As long as you help that's all anyone needs. If you do choose to make it your life than don't forget your family and friends because no one wants to be left with no friends or family.

In conclusion, I believe that you should enforce community service in schools because only the children shape the world. Also, there's a job for everyone you just have to look. Finally, you can spend as much time as you want on your job as long as your helping someone . In the end what everyone is really doing is helping the community in more ways than one, even though some people may say its not worth it when you see the face of joy n the person's face you are help at that very moment that's all that matters. Thank you for reading this.

7B2CB7ECC0B5,"Community service is something that is very important, just giving someone a hand can change their whole perspective on life.

The purpose of community service is to get out and make the world in which we live in a better place for everyone.

Doing something as simple as waving and asking how someone is doing can make someone's day worth while.

You will never know how much you can touch someone's heart with just a simple gesture.

It is important that everyone should do community service because it could have a positive impact on the person that is being helped as well as the person that is helping.

The feeling you get when you help someone with something is the greatest feeling in the world, there is nothing like it.

Helping an older person or being with an older person in a nursing home can be an amazing experience, you can learn about history from a standpoint of someone who was there and lived through it! That is a thing that not everyone gets to do in their life time.

Even being kind to a person that is having a bad day can make their life worth living.

If everyone would just care a little bit about each other you could save lives and the depression rate in our country could change drastically for the better.

Just think about saving someone's life, not everyone can say they have done that.

Our world has changed over the years, neighbors used to talk with each other daily just to see how they are doing, just to say hi, just to care for them.

Now all this country cares about is getting from point A to point B and in the process being rude toward others that are getting in their way.

Just think of how we could change things by just saying, "" Hi, how are you?"", this country could be the way it used to be.

And it wouldn't even be all that hard to do.

Community service changes lives, that is why it is important that everyone should do it more often then they care for only themselves.",3,Community service,Independent
3A2D732CA9A2,"I think that all students shouldn't have to perform community service. It takes up too much time of what we need to do. If all students have to perform and they have something to do at home they wouldn't have enough time to get what they need done. They might fall behind on school work because of all the stress or work that they have to finish. Students could feel overwhelmed with the responsibility they have. Maybe a student could finish what they have to do but they have no time for them self. If all students have to perform community service it would tire the student out over time and or put them in a state where they feel that they would fail if they don't perform the service. Now if the community service didn't pay a role on your grade then maybe it would be easier for the students maybe it even builds character but it still takes your time away. With school it takes 7 hours from your day then homework when you finish all that you got to do your part in community service. If your lucky you might have time for yourself. other student might think that having to perform community service could be boring or think that its useless because someone is going to end up doing something that put all their hard work to waste and then give up or stop because they think that its useless because someone is reversing their affect. An example of not being able to finish their work is when they have to do a major project for social studies and they don't do they fail that class and since they have to do community service they don't get to finish, or if they have a unit test on math and they have to study but they cant because they wasted time doing community service and then fail the test and then fail the class. When students fail a class they start getting lazy and don't do any work so they fall behind in school. So my opinion on this is that all students shouldn't have to perform community service they should only perform if they decide to and think they could handle all the work and not fall behind in school.",3,Community service,Independent
CDD6D1B45E9F,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that you should require students to perform community service because our community's land like the track behind the middle school, and the big parking lot and field where the middle schoolers have free time, behind the middle school isn't looking too spiffy. There's litter everywhere. So what we can do as a community is get some plastic gloves, some plastic bags, and more trash cans, and start picking up the litter, we also need to do better on looking out for people who bring food outside because one minute someone will be eating, then when the security guards aren't looking they'll throw their wrappers on the ground an walk away. So if a security guard does catch a student littering they should report them to the office and you should assign them a detention and community service. If we had more trash cans around the field then I think there would be less littering and if there still is littering then that's what community service is for. Thank you for your time, I hope you think about it.

462769ABDD5B,My opinion about performing a community service is that they should have a community service. i think that they should have that because the a community service gives a help to the community because helping out in the community is very good and could give a good help to residents in the community because some communities have old people or even paralised person which can't help out in the community. So i think the students should have a community service. The principal should required the students to have a community service. If students would decide to have community service they would do a awesome job by helping out residents and helping out the environment because your helping it out by not letting that much trash get in to our world. You would help the plants by letting them grow more and live more. Then will have much more food and vegetables. So i think having a community service is good so will help out the environment to stay clean and have a better and cleaner community. I think those students who say community service takes too much time they should just give some time when they are just sitting their in the couch and go help out your community and the environment.,2,Community service,Independent

I think community service should be required to all students. Students can learn a lot from helping others. In high school community service is required, so you might as well fit it into your schedule somehow before you get into high school. Students may say they have better things to do, but half those students probably really don't have anything to do. They can spend hours playing video games and being on Facebook every week, but can't devote to doing volunteer work. Volunteering isn't a priority to many, but its more of a priority helping your community or possibly the world, than playing video games or wasting time on the computer. Not all students play sports so its not hard to fit 1-2 hours of community service into their schedule. When we are spending time on the computer or on our phone, that's time being wasted that can be used doing volunteer work. That's why volunteer work should be required.

Community work never hurts, Its something that would be good for our school. It s something that others will appreciate and when your done not just make you feel good because you helped someone but also make the ones you helped feel good. Some may say that's its a waste of time and they could be out having fun with there friends or going to parties and what not. But if they never know the feeling of accomplishment when it comes to that.

Have you ever went to the store and seem teens walking around in there PJs? And its 12 noon and you wonder '' well they sould be doing something better than that.'' I have and being a teen i have done it, and im not saying that all teens do it or its a bad thing im just saying they could be doing something better with there time like helping elders and if they don't think that's cool they could go to the park and clean it up, so they could hang there with there friends. It would kids off the streets hanging out and putting them to do something useful.

Have you ever wondered why most of the parks are dirty of why you don't really see students helping out there community? Well that's because you give them a choice to ether do community service or not to. If there lazy of course there going to pick not to due to the fact they don't want to go. But if they had to go more things would get done around the town because they would be helping. They would go clean parks, help the elder, little kids at schools, soup kitchens for the poor and many more. Its could really make a change to our community.

When you get older in life and you need a job or you want this collage to want you, then having community service will look good on your application for the collage/job and they will think ''Well they seem to care about there town to help out this much '' and by them knowing that you did this to help you will look good to them. Which in the long shot you will look better, then some of the others. Not just helping you out with collage or a job but skills in life. You might have learned something while doing your community service that helps you out when in a tough predicament that you come across.

I did community service a couple of times and i certainly learned new skills. I helped out elder and cleaned beaches it was fun to me and I believe that it would be good for our school to require community service not just for the town and people but for themselves to feel personal pride in that they did for there community and themselves. It would be a great thing to do for our school.

In my personal opinion I believe we should all take part in cleaning our community for a better future but we both know how persistent someone can be. Perhaps we should create a virtual simulation of what Earth will look like if we continue to destroy it. Let me reassure you it won't be pretty. Maybe this will give them motive because they don't want to live in filth.

After doing so we can convey how much of a difference little things make for example: when you throw something in the water it's eventually going to end up in the ocean.

Imagine what a water fall would look like if it were overflowing with garbage. You might want to offer something such like five extra minutes to break as well. Something so petty to you like five more minutes could be the difference that changes it all.

This will clean our community, motivate a lot of people, and get students to participate in physical activity. It should also build good work ethics, and teamwork skills. Which will reflect on class work and the fighting ratio could possibly drop due to the fact that students will be much more prone to resolve an issue with words rather than to have conflict since they have been working together.

Decisions are important in everyday life and affect many people around you in such a great way or a horrible way ,but you can only decide how it affects them. Community service is a great way to help your community you can tutor young children or you can clean graffiti and litter, but some people don't enjoy doing this or some don't even have time to fit this type of activity into their daily schedule. TEACHER_NAME I don't think that you would enjoy someone coming into your home telling you what to do would you? I do not agree with you on requiring all students to participate in community service because people have busy schedule and live and also some people don't want to participate in community service.

Many students have busy schedule s that they cant fit community service on at this moment. why would you want to require them to participate in community service when all its going to do is make their lives even more hectic. On the other hand some students don't want to participate in community service because they think its boring and a complete waste of their time so why make them do something that they wont even enjoy . I f the students don't enjoy what their doing then they wont understand the lesson that they are suppose to learn from the experience.

In conclusion TEACHER_NAME all i have to asked you is would you want to be forced to do something that you didn't want do? I don't agree with requiring the students to do community service. What I do think is fair and will accommodate every one is a sign up sheet asking students if they want to participate in community service.

This certainly is a problem. Students getting it in their heads that helping others, and helping our community isn't important! Frankly I am astonished that my peers, my friends are against helping people and their surroundings. Of course they should help! It's benefits the people who they are helping , the world around them, and it keeps the school clean!

To start with, we who work with people in programs such as tutoring, are helping people who need help! People who need tutoring greatly appreciate the help they are given! Not only does this help their sense of pride and accomplishments, it enables then to have a better future, and a better life. Also, I know when I help somebody I get a feeling of pride and I feel happy knowing that I made a difference in that persons well being and in this case their education. Don't we want that kind of feeling for our school?

Secondly, This kind of program could help the person who is helping grade. You could count this as a grade in a certain class or their homerooms. It could also be simply just extra credit. Not only would this make the people who participated become proud of themselves and the grades, their parents would also be proud of their growing grades, and of the school. The would be proud to say, ""My child makes good grades because they help people and their school out."" This would bring people flocking to our school.

Lastly, If we are cleaning up the school, visitors the are looking at and rating our school will see a clean school, where students are proud to be and learn. This could bring sponsors, and money to our school. With more money we could get supplies for our programs, our build a high school. Which, we know we benefit you, and us students.

I have heard you are making new rules to the students of SCHOOL_NAME about how every student must participate in community service. I think that is a very excellent idea on the hand i have a few disagreements with it.

First, some students may not eligible because they need more help than others do and they can only do so much, but after a few hours or days they wont be able to do not as much anymore.

On the other hand is that they would still be able to do work when they feel better. I know this because one of my friends are like this and when I go over to her house she is unable to do a lot of things.

Secondly, when students might be doing community service they never know if one of their family members has passed and wont know till they get home. People has made my dad do community service, and when he got home he didn't have no clue his mom died. He wasn't able to go to the funeral because of community service.

Lastly, Some kids miss school and they miss class work and what they were supposed to learn that day. Kids can do community service in their yard and anywhere else they can think of. I believe students should do community services but only for the ones who has been disobedient toward their teachers and their classmates. The students who have been obeying and not acting up while in class should not have to do it unless they choose to.

I am a student at your school currently and I've noticed that many students do not do much community service. I myself do not do much either, but I think there are ways that you and other's in our school can help the community.

I am not promoting that students have mandatory community service, I would just like it if you promote community service. What I am trying to get across is, have fundraiser's in school or allow speakers to come in to show what we can do. Many students believe that community service is a waste of their time. By forcing them to do community service, they will feel even less obliged to do so. Allowing kids to see what is going on in the world will allow them to think of how they can help.

One example of promoting community service is having a public speaker come in. Someone who has worked to help the community already. Students will know that the person has done community service and knows what it's like. Students can relate to that person. Also, the person will persuade my fellow students to help the less fortunate or just the community.

Another example of promoting community service would be having fundraiser's in school. Gathering can's food for those who don't have any. Go to a nearby shelter and entertain the people there whom are less fortunate.

If you do these things, or things along these lines I can guarantee that more students will be participating in community activities. As I said earlier, many students believe community service is a waste of time. Most of those students spend their weekends sitting in front of a television screen. I admit that I do that to over some weekends, but showing kids that they can make a difference will give them the ability to get off the couch and go help the community. There will be a significantly larger amount of kids that help the community. Though it may not be a significant amount of help, it's better than no help.

These are my views on how we should deal with students and community service. I hope you at least take them into consideration. Promoting community service will be very helpful, and it can also help students get into better schools in the future.

My point of view would be on requiring students to perform community service. This will do a lot of good for them inside as well as outside of school. For example, in tutoring we meet kids and also get to interact with them. Community Service also increases our chances of getting High School stuff out of the way. So basically it helps us as well as the kids we tutor and help. People who say it takes up time it actually doesn't it just that they are lazy or just don't want to help the community out and lend a hand. Its also that they might just not get along with children. They need to think about doing other things if they are the type of people that don't get along with kids. What they don't notice is that a lot of things they do now is community service they just don't realize it yet. Another example is like if you were walking home and saw an older citizen struggling to pick something up they might have dropped. If you cared you would go and pick it up for them and hand it to them. If they needed some help crossing the street you would expect more from your students than to just stand and watch. One good thing is that they would also get some good morals about life and they might feel good helping someone out. To just know that you did something good and helped someone its an awesome feeling. The more people give their time to help other, would most likely get acknowledged by good and well known company's because of that. Requiring community service in our school will also make and improve our social life with other schools. A lot of community service tells a lot about the person who is doing it and if its a school there might be a big possibility that there might be more students who care about the world and doing good for the community enrolling. So you should really consider making community service a required activity.

In high school there are many difficult decisions to make. What classes to take? Do I want or need a job? Who should I associate with? What dress should I wear to the prom? You know, things like that. I know that you have recently stated that you would like all students to participate in some form of community service and even though it is a very stressful and busy time I completely agree.

I think that it is very important to give to your community and always try to help out. I believe that some services could be picking up trash, tutoring, helping plant flowers around that school to make it look a little more welcoming. I also think that participating in this activity teaches responsibility, respect for hard work, and it also gives us an intake on things outside of high school. This could also help some students decide on which career path to take. Depending on if they might realize some improvements that could be made to make the community better as a whole and decide to be on the town committee. Or even if they enjoy teaching younger kids and wish to follow a path into educating.

This project, I believe, would better both our school and community in the long run. I hope that my perspective has helped you on your decision and I wish to thank you for your time and dedication you put into the bettering this school .

To have kids take community service is good for the world and it should be required to do community service and to clean up the school would help then people would do it but if it involves cleaning then some people will say yes and some no.

but people like me would be happy to help and keep this city clean. And my friends wanted to join them in community service and i got in with them and now that the principal wants us to clean the school and to clean the litter was easy but the rest of the school was still unfinished. So then when we were almost done we cleaned the halls, class rooms, and helped the janitors mope certain areas and now our and community service is best to do and it also takes time away from your education. So the best thing to do is to have community service on some days and get people who want to do it so the choice is yes the principal should but get people that enjoy community service. And for example like if i were to be doing the service and i enjoyed it then id want to keep on doing it but is i didn't enjoy it then i would be home doing homework. But also have it after school and get people who can stay to perform the service.",2,Community service,Independent

Community service. I think that it should be an option for students to do community service. My reasoning for this is because : not all students will have the time, some students wont do it from the heart, and also this will bring uprisings among the students.

As I stated my first argument for my opinion is not all student will have the time. Making someone do something is not always the best choice because student can be really busy and the you just may not know this. In the shape that the environment is in now most parents have to work therefore there may not be enough time -looking into their schedule. It's not as easy as to just get driving to the destination. That needs time and with time come money. They will have to pay for gas and squeeze something in their schedule that they know won't fit. This is also how stress occurs.

My second reason that I feel community service should be optional is that some students wont do it from the heart. Nowadays a lot of kids feel that is important to impress their friends so they do thing for attention ,hence; the task will never be done from the heart. There are some students who are willing to do this and then there are those one who wouldn't give a ""hoot!"" Well this is why this should be optional and not mandatory. As an example, if I were to go to a party and wanted it clean so I made it mandatory for kids fourteen and up to clean the area then most of them wouldn't do it from the heart, whereas just asking form volunteers you know the job will get done whole-heartedly

My third and final reason why community service should be optional is be cause this will cause uprisings among the students. We all know that once a student is told to do something that they feel is ""stupid"" then this will cause attitudes, arguments, and yelling. No person likes to be around this twenty-four/seven so I would just see it that this was an optional thing.

In conclusion I hope you see why I think that serving people in our community (community service) should be optional. Again I state these reason to express my feeling for this and they are: not all students will have the time, some students wont do it from the heart, and also this will bring uprisings among the students.

Hello TEACHER_NAME, my name is STUDENT_NAME

and I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME in El Paso, TX. So TEACHER_NAME I have been tasked on a assignment for an opinion that students should be tasked to do community service at SCHOOL_NAME. So my opinion for students to volunteer for community service at SCHOOL_NAME is that I think students should be tasked for community service rather at a high school than rather a middle school and I have tons of reasons for this event.

One of my reasons is that students would get better advantages of getting community service at a high school rather than getting more disadvantages at a middle school. Another reason is that students that are going to volunteer for community service is that they get more opportunities at doing community service at lets say for example a swimming pool and you could volunteer as a life guard and you can help clean the high ways for litter than just doing community service at your own school rather like middle school you can only do community service only on the school campus rather than doing it someplace else. Another reason is that lets say for example you have to earn 20 hours of community service to pass a high school class and you can do those hours on the school days or the weekend unlike middle school you receive 15 hours of community service and you do it possibly every day but it can mess up study time.

So TEACHER_NAME the reason that you should have students do community service at a high school is because you can socialize, work, and you can meet different people in the process and make them as friends rather than helping the same person that you already know. I hope when you read this TEACHER_NAME I think we could settle this and I can tell you my opinion is no. I hope you can understand this and agree of what I have to say about this event that I am tasked on. Thank you for your time.",2,Community service,Independent

I do not think students should be required to do community service because, some students might not be physically fit enough to do it. Also, others may have a very busy life that they may not have the time to do it. And others may not think it's fair if other schools don't have to do it and they do.

A person that's not physically fit enough may hurt themselves. If they are picking up rubbish, they could strain themselves if they have to bend down too far. If it's during the day, they could work too hard and get a heat stroke. With this happening, it could cause death or lifetime pain.

For people that don't have time it might make life a whole lot harder. These people could have other activities that were scheduled before being told that they must do community service. If so, they must go through either rushing to get to the place they need to be or not even be able to make it there. Then sooner or later, they might turn out to be very gloomy adults because they weren't able to enjoy life as a child.

Because it's the principals choice, some schools may have to and some schools may not. The students may get mad and move to another school. It then may lead to a school closing because it doesn't have enough students. If that happens, the principals should let the students decide if they want to do community service or not.

These are my reasons why I don't believe students must do community service.

I think everyone should donate some of their time towards community service. our environment needs to be clean every single day.

Community service should be a school rule that involves everyone. Some students litter and don't care if our planet is clean or dirty. Also, some students care so much about themselves, they don't want to help anyone in anything.

Helping others is great and can help you be a better person. Little kids need help in school sometimes and can use some of the students help. One can be a role model for them, and then that will make them be a better person. If we help our new generations be better persons, we might change the world into a better place to live in.

Another great thing we can do for this world, is we can help pick up trash.

Students litter sometimes and don't really care if we live in a dirty world or not. We can help pick up trash in groups or partners. This can be a fun activity rather than something boring which makes no sense to us. By picking up a few pieces of trash everyday, we can live in a much cleaner earth.

Please consider this and make this a school rule. Each student can donate a few minutes of their time to clean up our community and make a difference in this world. We can keep up the cleaning and the tutoring for better generations and a better world.      ",3,Community service,Independent

Community Service would probably not be such a good idea. Kids these days are more Lazy and very violent, very few of them are going to be the volunteer type. Why i say this is because if you take a good look around the school, you will see them everywhere bullying and not doing work and coming in late. Then there are those very rare ones who will do homework and not bully and actually do something good for everyone's lives. By doing this kids are just going to rebel against your community service act and just wont do it and there might be those that will do it, but that is because they want to and want to get somewhere in their lives. By doing this its just going to make things get worse where they will rebel. Make a very wise decision about this rule, for it has a good chance of either going bad or going very well.

This one is a little bit like bag the bag and it went good and bad. This rule has three outcomes now, going good and bad or bad or going good. Those that are selected to tutor will most likely do it. The litter part will go worse however since kids just don't want to do things most of the time. If some kids think of bag the bag there is a good chance they just wont do their part in community service and there will be some bad outcomes in that. But if they don't think of bag the bag you have a chance of them doing their part in community service. In my personal opinion it is not too bad of an idea but others will think it is a bad idea so there are those who will take part in it and there are those who will not do it and get very lazy overall its not too bad of an idea in my opinion of course.",2,Community service,Independent

I truly believe that not all students should be apart of community service. And these are my reasons to back it up. My first reason is that some kids do want to help their community and make it a better place, but some kids have a lot to of stuff to do and can't really fit that in. My second reason is that most kids are just plain lazy. Don't want to do anything with there lives or do something for their community. So it really would be a waste of time trying to make students go and do community service because all they is going to do is just sit there and complain or just don't come.

I think that you should have kids decide on going to do community service. and decide what time is good for them to go and do it!

F986C612AC3A,"Community service is helpful to the community and is good for people and should be required for students. It is a great way for students to become a better person by helping the community. Community service allows the community to become cleaner and better by students helping. It allows unfortunate people to get help from people and allows neglected areas to be cleaned. Community service is a great way of helping the community become better in a whole.

Community service makes students become a kinder type of person. It drives students away from negative influences like drugs and gives them more positive influences by helping others. Community service teaches students to help others and not push others away and to treat the community that they live in with more respect.

Community service also allows a better community for people to live in. It allows for students to make a cleaner community and not litter it and make it dirty. It stops violence and drugs by teaching students to become better people. Community service also makes more development in parks and other places.

Community Service also allows a chance for those that are unfortunate or places that are unfortunate to get help. An example is giving out food to the homeless. By doing this, people who do not get food regularly have the chance to get some for sure.",3,Community service,Independent

I Think its a great idea for us to start doing community service

Community service is an important thing because there's a lot of people that don't care about our world, and they would throw garbage on the street, but we can make things better by cleaning an picking up all litters.

This would also be good for some kids that only spend time on video games.

they could actually help and doing something for others, instead of doing what they like to do.

As the months past by we see that Our country is not the same, for these problems

For example, Littering, Robbing, Pollution, etc.

This could also be a punishment for kids. So if there were to have bad grades, You could tell them either you do better or do community service. The only thing that probably wouldn't be a good thing is if you made them do community service on weekends, That would just be unfair from my point of view, and im pretty sure parents would agree with me. Also There are also some community service that im sure people would apply to like Helping the elderly or spending time with them at nursery, And maybe taking care of pets without Owners. What else could I say, Like i said I think this is a good idea

I give you my 100%. On doing this and making our country better and the students helping out by doing community service.

My second Example On how Community service is good is by us older grades help out little elementary school kids. How does that help? It helps because if there stuck on a question or need help with there homework. The older grades can tutor them or explain to them

Well I hope You consider on taking this letter a help and Good luck to your decision

I like to do community service because if helps out thee less fortunate people who can't do stuff for there self because they don't have money or are homeless. I think that making everybody do community service would make the world come together and be a better place and it could keep our environment clean. It could stop some of the bad things from coming because most people don't have anything better to do then get them selves into trouble if they do community service it would give them something to do.

Doing community service to help the less fortunate is good. It could help provide a roof over peoples head who don't have one. It could provide them with clothes and food. Just think about it you could be doing something good for someone else and not just yourself. And i'm pretty sure the people that we are helping out would be just as thankful as we are to help them out.

Doing community service would help the world come together and be a better place. It would bring people to work together and get to know others. And it would get people to clean up the environment and stop throwing stuff around just anywhere. It could get everyone to just work together and clean up and help out the environment.

Doing community service could prevent bad things such as crimes from happening because most of the time people don't really have anything to do but do things that could get them into trouble with the law. It could give them something to do instead of doing bad things such as robbing people or shooting and things like that. It could change a person if they see how hard some people have it out here and maybe make them stop doing things that they have no business doing anyway. It would be something good that they would be doing for them and someone else who needs it.

Overall i think that community service is a good idea.

I think that our school is not helping enough with the less furniture. I suggest that all students in the school be required to have to do community service. if the students at our school would help those who didn't have as much as they did then they would be more grateful for what they have and maybe think that school is a good thing because of how they could end up without it. Our school would be better if the community liked us more and we can get the community to like us if we help them.

To get the students to help with the community then you should make community service more fun. I suggest four ways to get the students to want to help.

First of all, you require that everybody will be graded on how they help their community. Second, you have your students see how bad the community is in some places so that they want to help. Third, you reword them with maybe a dress down day. Fourth you have them do there service to the city during school so that the students don't take up their time to do things that they think are more important.

If you listen and act on the suggestions that I have made then you will have a happier community and a happier school. A happier community and happier school will make you a much happier person. If you are happier then everyone will be happier because I know I will be.

I think we should have a club in doing community service. Some of the students think it is a wonderful idea and some think it's a waste of there time. I think we should have a club in doing so for many reasons. The first reason is because if we don't take care of our community then it will be a mess and no one would want to live here. The second reason is that if we have a clean community, children would want to play in a cleaner area instead of a messy one.

The third reason is that if there is litter on the ground then it will attract mice and disgusting animals and no one I know likes mice running around every where they go. The forth reason we should have a club is that if you want children to learn and if they don't know how to do something then students could tutor them and they will learn and be better at it. the fifth reason is that when people don't have help and they think no one wants to help them then our community would be filthy and abandoned. These are all of the reasons why I think its a great idea to have a club to help the community and the people in it so it will be clean and the people would feel like they are cared and people would want to be their friend.

Please consider not making community service mandatory;

reasons supported by this essay:

""Agenda comment!"" OTHER_NAME teacher screeches when OTHER_NAME tells her that she does not have her homework due to the fact that her community service took so long. I do not think that community service should be mandatory due to the fact that it would take away from time that could be spent doing homework, or studying for tests. Also, it would take a lot of time away from sports.

To begin, community service takes too much time away form homework, which is what students should be doing. Studies show that community service is extremely time consuming. Homework is important, because it tests whether or not a student understands the subject that the teacher is going over. For example, i know that my seventh grade year was so packed with homework, that i barely had time to do anything other than work on homework. So, please, don't require community service.

Furthermore, students not only need time to do homework, but they also need time to study for upcoming tests and quizzes. Recent studies show that 80% of students study every night, for about 30 minutes. These 30 minutes added to the hour or hour and a half of homework the students get would be too difficult to try and add community service time. Once, my teacher wanted all of us to complete community service, but half of the class was unable to do this, because their parents worked late and so they didn't have a ride to pick them up from wherever they were serving the community.

To continue, it has been proven that at least 70%

of students play sports after school, meaning that with all the homework and studying going on, they definitely won't have any time for community service. A few of my friends play lacrosse, and they really enjoy it. But, they leave their house almost immediately after they get home from school and get home around 8:00 P.M. which is pretty late, especially if they still have an hour left of homework. Sports are just as important as schoolwork, because in order to stay healthy, students have to stay active.

In retrospect, community service is not as necessary because of the amount of time students spend doing schoolwork as well as playing sports. Also, not all students can get a ride to and from wherever they would volunteer at. Please consider my reasoning.

A concerned student",5,Community service,Independent

I have heard of your potential decision to require community service from all students. (I am assuming that the students we are referring to are older than elementary school age.)

The details of the requirement have not yet been released to us yet, but if the time you require is more than six hours a week, I oppose the decision to make it an obligation. I do not think that students should be made to do this. The choice to perform a service for the community is definitely one that should be encouraged, but should remain a choice. The reason I think this is because many students have other responsibilities they must use the time to do. If you require them to do community service, their other responsibilities will have to be put on hold until they can get back to them. Some of their activities that they need the time to do may be personal, for example, visiting a sick relative. Others are for their education, like going to an internship (for high school aged students). Either way, this decision will affect how your students will have to manage their schedules after school hours.

In my opinion i think that all students shouldn't have to participate in community service, because some kids have important things that they have to do, not want to do, have to do. For example what if a student had siblings that were younger than they were and couldn't take care of themselves, so their older siblings would have to take care of them. Then the student couldn't take care of their community service hours. Another is what if a student participated in sports and had an important game to go to. That means that they couldn't finish their hours as well. Another example is what if students had a big test to study for and it was worth half of their grade, then they would have to study instead of community service. That also means that another student could not fulfil their community service hours. It's not just three or six students that could not fulfil their hours. The whole class would have to study for the test and more that six students have younger siblings that they have to take care of and finally, more that six students participate in sports or other extra curricular activities which means that all of those students could not perform their given community service hours. Since they could not perform their given hours then they would have to face the consequences even though it wasn't the students faults. They had more important things they had to do, not want to do, had to do.

living a clean , garbage free area is very important. some people just liter because they are to lazy to throw their trash in their trash cans. some people even let their babies walk outside their side walk, filled with bacteria and trash. little kids are tempted to eat the trash and sometimes end up indigested the trash. if we do a team were we pick up the trash once a month , mother nature could be proud of us. also by cleaning our community we make people happy, and we can live in a healthy and friendly community.

kids need help with their home work every time. sometime parents do not have time to help their kids because they are busy .if we do a homework help club, we could help these children be smarter so they could succeed and achieve in life. also we can save their parents time in their work and have time to play with their son or daughter.

the elderly sometimes need assistance or are lonely because nobody come and visit them.

sometimes old people feel lonely because either they were abandoned by their families or their are just one person. if we visit them once in a while, we could play a game with them or read a story with them, they cold be happy and enjoy they have company.

I think that every student should have to do community service for picking up trash and also cleaning up the school. Every student should have to do community service because some of those students are the ones that are making the mess at school. But it is also an unfair decision because some of the students that have to be required to do community service aren't the ones usually making all of that trash so it would be wasting their time, some of the students could just be innocent. Although if you would like a clean school you might want to consider requiring community service for at least every classroom to take turns doing community service.

Those students that tend to litter at school should be the ones cleaning up after themselves. For example some students just throw their trash on the ground without even caring that it could destroy their school. Having community service is very important because the whole entire school could just build up the trash.

Therefore, the idea of having community service is a great idea. Students should be required to have community service. The school would look much better without any rubbish on the ground.

I understand that you are considering making all students here at SCHOOL_NAME do community service. Community service is a great thing, but it shouldn't be forced upon students. I think it's better to try and convince students to perform more community service, so they do it willingly and have fun doing it. I have come up with a plan to help you do this.

Students are interested in many things, like music and sports, but they are much more interested in having fun. I believe that students see community service as boring, which is why they do not want to perform any community service tasks. If you can convince students that helping out in the community can be fun, they will definitely be more willing go out and volunteer their time and hard work. Students want to be with friends as much as they can. If one student wants to go clean up the park with the city council, they are sure to invite their best friend. Their friend will want to help because they're best friend is helping. They see it as more fun because they will be with someone they know. If we try a technique like this, the outcome can be great. If we create a group, here at school, of students who like to volunteer, we can definitely convince more students to help out of lovely city. Students will convince their friends to join, and quickly, we will have a large group of students that want to help. We can organize our own school volunteer work, or we can team up with the city council and work with them on city wide projects and events.

Students are usually only open to new things and experiences, when their friends are involved with them. If students learn that volunteering is fun, they will grow up and have this same mentality. They will have the chance to open themselves up to a new experience they are sure to love! Who knows, maybe one day they'll grow up to change the world!

My name is STUDENT_NAME and as you have been deciding on the choice of making community service a must, I have been asking to see how other people take their views on it for instance some people think that community service takes time and energy that they don't have it really makes it impossible for them to do anything. Can you imagine trying to balance band practice, basketball practice, play practice and community service you might manage for a couple of days but after a few days you will be getting very tired and it would be very hard to manage all of that. Also some people don't live near the community and still go to this school which isn't bad but it sure isn't good when you have to do community service for this community not the one you live in. That would make it partially impossible for you to do everyday and some people have split parents (divorced) which means they are already moving back and forth between them they don't need to be having to go to community service things at the community that they might not even be in at the time, it would screw up the schedules of the parents of the kids and it would put a lot of pressure on the kids to make sure they get it right every time they have to do it.

I also see the other side of it on how if we have community service it can bring families together to do something nice for the community. Plus it would help reduce our garbage near and around roads, highways, schools, homes, work places, and public areas which would help make a big difference. If you recycled everything you picked up then you would be reducing greenhouse gas emissions into our atmosphere and making a small step towards a green planet. It would be hard but we could do it, but it will affect the way people live greatly.

In the end it would come down to your choice, will you affect people's lives greatly, or will you let our lives continue on like we are?

I think that students should perform community service. Some students may think that community service is a waste of time, but they are wrong. It's not a waste of time. It can actually benefit you in the future. Community service can help you get into college. Colleges are sometimes picky about who they want in their college and they usually pick the one with a lot of community service hours because they know that the ones who are doing community service are students who are good and want to help the community. That is one of the thing that a college on a student's application.

Also, there are community service that can either be enjoyable and it can help you with your career path or help you find one. I got two friends who are doing Civil Air Patrol for their community service hour. They find it very enjoyable and it help them with their career path. I believe that Civil Air Patrol also give out scholarship for people.

As you can see principal, students should perform community service. It's not a waste of time like some of them believe. It could get them into college and give a bright future to look forward to.

The debate in weather we should all be required to complete community service or not is a big decision to make. In my opinion we all should be required to have done some community service because it not only helps our community but it helps the students grow as people in society. This could be a chance for students to feel like they can make a big difference in such a little way. Also some students already perform community service on a daily basis and don't even know it. This could be a chance to show them what a big help they are as well as congratulate those students who do know they do community service on a daily basis. I think that community service can be a lot of fun if we know that we are doing it to help others and ourselves. This is a project that not only a few students can be incorporated with but the whole school can take part. Another great reason to include community service in our program at school is because it looks great on our high school transcript and for colleges to look at. This could help a lot of our students succeed in careers of there future and even making it into colleges of there choice.

Some examples of community service projects that the school could perform are tutoring, cleaning up the liter around school and on the sidewalks around town, raising money for a foundation or group in need, or even having a ""big brother"" program. These simple acts can make a huge difference in someone's life especially if they are in need of some care or just need someone there with them. I feel like when and if we do this we could have a great outcome in the attitudes of the students.

When you make this decision I encourage you to think about the great things that could come out of putting community service into the program. I deeply feel it could help many students. And I hope you can put that into consideration when you make the decision to put it in or not.

I think that having community service should be put into school because its good for high school as a credit, helps the earth environment, and makes the school go green about things.

When we all go to high school they want us to enter the school with community service done so that we help the community more and to have it as a credit. For example : we can attend and help the old people at a resting home or help at a local library to show that we have done our hours for school and that we have dedicated to something by helping the community. Teachers would probably like that quality in a kid so they would put you in a advanced classes since they see that you are smart and dedicated to do something as you are told to do so.

Doing community service can also help the earth. our earth has been going threw a difficult time because of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and doing some community service can help it a lot. Like going to the beach and picking up the garbage left on the sand ,or picking up trash left on the streets stuff like that would be perfect. Our global warming is getting really bad and doing community service shows that you care for the earth and you are willing to do something to save it.

Also when doing all of this community service the school will be known as a going green school. We can have recycled paper and bottles to show that we go green for the earth and so that we try to cut down on killing trees. Having all of this may make the school more popular because parents would want that since its better for there child education and learning process for their kids to know more about the community, our planet earth, and how to help it in many different ways.

Well thank you for you time , I hope that you take this opportunity and try it because doing so can really make a difference for the environment, community, and the school.

Sincerely your student ,

I do think that all students should be required to perform community service. I think that all students need to participate in helping out where they live. I think that students should only have to do it once every four or five months or so. I think that you should be able to pick your community service, such as if you like to help with kids, help out at an elementary school, or pre-school . If you like to play sports, you should be able to pick helping out with community sports, like soccer or basketball.

I think if all students have to do community service, it will make it a better community, and people will be more involved. But, i don't think you should have to do community service all the time, because i think that students will get sick of it doing it a lot of times. There should be a lot of options you have to pick from while doing community service. Students should not be forced to something they don't want to do, like if they don't like school you shouldn't make them do tutoring for there community service.

I think if you have students do it only on occasions, they would enjoy it, and look forward to d doing it more. Maybe if you do it twice a year, then it will be something for the students to look forward too. They might like it better because they only have to do it on occasions, not all the time.

Helping out your community is very important. A lot of people or places need the community service. They need help with kids stuff, and cleaning up your community. It will make the students think more about helping out there community, and maybe make them want to do it more often. But then again, a lot of people might not want to do it. I think for people who actually participate and really help out with the community service, they should get a little reward. They should get extra credit in a class or something, because people who aren't participating shouldn't get rewarded for not doing anything.

That is what i think about having community service required in our school. I think that students should only have to do it time to time, not once a month ore week. I think that students should be-able to pick what they want to do for community service, not have the principle, or somebody else pick. I think that having community service be required is a good idea. I think it will really change the way the town it.

I think that community service is very important for us and the environment not only because we are doing good things for our earth but because it helps us too. We come together with people to do something special for our planet. but, I strongly suggest that community service should become an optional decision for students because students should have lots of spare time and use it wisely like to do homework or play sports after school and or have some free time. We need time on our hands to do activities that we need to accomplish. Even though Community service is very important, most kids don't like helping out in that specific type of way.

I myself would consider being a part of community service because i understand how important it is to our everyday lives.

We need community service so people can come together to help out. For example, we need someone to pick up litter or help out someone who is sick and needs to be treated or taken care of. Even though i think it should be an optional opinion on wether or not to be a part of community service i would like to become a part of helping out and everyone getting together and along so we can make our world a better, safer, cleaner, and happier place where we wont have to worry about these important decisions.",2,Community service,Independent

Kids love to have fun, they don't want to be forced to do community service.

They want to enjoy life by doing things they want to do, not by what people tell them to do. I'm totally with you on this one though, I believe kids all over the world should participate in some kind of community service. People should always give back to the community and by making kids starts now will increase the chances of them doing it in the future.

There are many different ways you can give back to the community. For example volunteering somewhere is a form of community service. Sometimes you don't even have to do that, it can be as little as helping a neighbor on yard work or picking up trash in a neighborhood. You can make volunteering fun to. For example you can organize a program at a local church to raise money, there can be food, refreshments, sports, games, and activities.

In all I believe all people including kids should give back to there community. It shows respect and care, and it shows that your thankful.            ",3,Community service,Independent

I think that it is a great idea for students to do community service! I think it is a great way for students to help protect our environment and help the next generation to be even smarter than this one. This is a good way to keep children from playing video games all day. This will make our community much more pretty but also more successful. This way it will stop students from littering because they will see how much there is and how hard it is to pick up all of the trash. Plus, it will help the students become better citizens now and in the future. Friends could talk to each other while helping the environment at the same time instead of talking over some online gaming system like X Box or Play Station. They could get exercise for their whole body instead of just their fingers. If we teach elementary school students we can get to know some of the teachers better as well as some of the students. We could also learn something new about ourselves while we are tutoring the younger elementary school children. One last thing is that the students will learn that everything isn't just about themselves, but about the whole community we all live in. As you can see I am in favor for us students to do community service. The only problem is that it might conflict with extra curricular activities such as sports or competitions. If we can find a way to get the community service not to interfere with activities other students are participating in I think that this will be a very successful idea.

I have a idea for the community service for students. I am speaking on behalf of 93 % of the students as well, or close to that percentage. You may not agree with this ideas but all I ask of you is to hear me out and give them a chance. I am we can come to a agreement for the students.

I think we should have the students only have to do community service two or three times a week. For two or three weeks until the next groups does there service. Each group should have five or six students in it and they will do certain things together. Once there weeks are up a next group comes in and this cycle wont repeat until a 2 months later. So I am asking we skip one month of community service. so we go a month skip a month then go a month and skip a month and so on.

I know this idea will go well with many students. Plus the service they do will get over before to late so they can get home and do any home work and any of there own things. Please try and give this idea a chance Principal.

Even though community service is good for cleaning up our environment, I still don't think that you should make us do community service. It takes students free time away and some kids probably won't have time to do it because they have a lot of other things to do like studying for tests, or doing there homework or even have time to be with their friends or family. If you make students do community service there's probably going to be a 30% percent chance that some students grades might go down. If I was you i would not make students do community service.

community service should be for people that have enough time to do it you shouldn't make all the students do it. Even though Community service makes our world healthier it doesn't mean that all kids should be force to do it because, kids are not the only people that liter or not clean up after their selves. It's everybody, and i don't think that kids should be punished for other people's mess, kids already have enough things to do like homework, grades, tests, personal life, and family problems if you make everybody do it your just going to put more wait on the children's' shoulders. I think that people who get introuble doing graffiti or get let out on probation or get introuble for drinking and driving should be forced to do a certain amount of hours. You should just let the people that like doing it do it and reward them with something like a homework pass or something that, and the kids that don't want to do it shouldn't have to be forced because they have to much stuff to do for or something to. If you do make the kids do Community service your making a big mistake, but hopefully this letter will make you agree with my opinion on this.",3,Community service,Independent

I was thinking that what if we handed out forms and or posted a sign up sheet for helping the community 3 or 4 days a week after school Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays from (3:00 - 5:00) for the months of April and May? The students can pick up trash, plant flowers and trees, do a fund raiser to raise money for charity, donate old clothes that don't fit you or clothes that fit you but you don't even wear. You could even give someone a big prize if they picked up the most trash or raised the most money for the fund raisers. You could start a program that helps save our community and make it clean. If students don't want to take part in this activity then every twice a month we could go to school and just go outside and help clean up the environment and plant trees and just make the community a better place for everyone to live.

864557850F63,"Community service is good for the community but i don't think its fair for all kids to do it. Kids should have choice if they want to do community service or do other activities. The people who do community service do it because they want to not because they have to. The people who don't do community service even if they had to they wouldn't put any real hard work into it they would just go threw the motions and try to wait until it is over which wouldn't help out at all.

kids who don't want to do community service will try anything to get out of it. They will probably ruin any fun for the people who do like to do community service with there negative attitudes. You also have to think how are you going to make them do community service if you tried to do it at school it would cut into class time and if it was after school how do you know that parents would make there kids do it. It could also cut into other activities such as sports or studying. It would just be a nuisance for the school and the kids. There really isn't a good reason to make kids do community service.

I think your idea is a very good one. Our community needs help, and its up to us to fix it.

Kids my age are able to help others and they don't. I think your idea will not only benefit for others, but to the children who make it come true. It could not only make us feel good about ourselves and others, but teach them a valuable lesson needed in life. Let me write more to explain about my opinion.

A lot of my friends like to relax, be with friends, play video games and watch television. Most of that listed can rot our brains. Why couldn't we be with friends while picking up trash... its called multitasking! They could be making new friends by helping out at elderly homes. They could broaden their horizons while having fun. Just because i use my time for community service doesn't mean that they do. Your idea will help them help other people. Why make homemade brownies that are just enough for yourself when you can make more for the homeless shelter? Why not teach our children of America to be more kind? These are questions that are asked and can be improved by your idea, especially if you decide to follow through with it!

Also, a big problem is if they want to do community service but don't know how. You could be assigning projects and organizing times, dates, and places for my friends and the student body. Rewarding the children for doing the jobs would also be a good way to get them active and started. Everyone likes to be praised for doing something right or having good morals. Why not also feel good after a job well done?

Helping our community could make it such a better place. Robbery, theft, and crime could be put to sleep! you never know if these things could influence other people to be good and kind as well. It could make our communities or districts look almost like a utopia. People would feel better, our environment would look better too! Helping others in our communities also helps us.

Overall, you need to follow through with this idea. Your school could also be part of students community service projects. You would be known for helping others in life, this is why it is so important, not only for us... but for others to learn something!` I hope that you take my opinion under consideration. I think there are benefits in it for all of us!

I do not think that every student should be forced to do community service. All community service is voluntary work, if its not voluntary, then it is just work. People who do community service enjoy and want to help the community, if they are forced to do community service, they would not perform to the best of their abilities and waste their time. This would not be best for the schools and the community.

The concept of community service is that you go do your work that you got and you do it for free because you wanted to and you feel good about yourself. Forcing a person to do this would take away all the positive effects except maybe getting the job done. Community service isn't always needed either. So having a very random schedule would be very hard for the students to keep up with.

This would cause stress to the students, teachers would have a hard time planning each day due to late notice help, and the community wouldn't get much help.",3,Community service,Independent

My thinking is that not all students should do community service. Why i think this is because there are many reasons why students would not be able to do this.

There are many reasons why i think all students should not have to do Community Service.

One reason would be that some students have to get home and do things. For example, they might have chores to do right after school. Another thing would be that they might have to take care of their siblings. Maybe some students have a lot of homework to get done or a project to do. So this is why i think this.

Another thinking i have is that some of these students may be in other activities or clubs. Some students might be involved in sports or in many other activities. These students might not be able to quit these activities or clubs for Community Service. What I think is that we never know what these students might have to do or if their busy.

All people are entitled to an opinion. My opinion is that community service should be required. Some people think that community service is a waste of time but they don't know how it can change your outlook on life. It can look good on college and job applications. If you wanted to be a teacher, you could go to a local elementary school to read or tutor children of all ages. It tells people that your dedicated to your job. Little things like this can do wonders.

Community service also builds life long friendships. You can meet people that are interested in the same things you are. You don't always have to give your life up to community service. You can work at a soup kitchen at lunch or set up fund raisers for people with special needs.

This also can help you conquer fears. With friends that you trust on your side you can conquer anything.

Many people think its a waste of time but they don't know how fulfilled you feel after you help. It also shows many people that their lucky not to be living in homeless shelter or begging for food on the streets. It makes them think twice before taking everything for themselves.

It also shows skills that they didn't think they were capable to do.

This is why i believe Community service should be required.

I believe community service should not be mandatory. Many students do sports or are in clubs and if you made it mandatory students would not have time for these activities. Students would probably blow off the community service anyway and do whatever they want. A third and final reason is that some community service takes long hours after school. If you will continue reading, I have more to say.

Students would not have time for clubs if community service was mandatory. Some clubs or sports have a positive influence on students, such as meting new people. I was on the cross country team for three years in a row. I met some good friends there. If community service was mandatory then this would not exist and students would miss very valuable opportunities. Another example is that sometimes, clubs help the school. At my school we have the helping hands club. You can tell by the name that this club helps the school. This club would have no time after school and our school would not be the place it is today.

Another reason is that some students would blow off the community service. This would mainly be the ones who did not do community service in the first place. In this scenario, there would be no point in making community service mandatory at all. I can pretty much guarantee that the ones who didn't do community service in the first place would not do it anyway. Besides, some students already help the community without calling it ""community service"". Some students do nice things for people but don't consider that community service.

My third reason is that community service takes too long after school. When the average student gets home, all they usually think about is getting away from the stress at school. They don't want to get more work to worry about. Community service also might intrude on their sleep time too. If a student does community service right after school, they would then have to do their homework, sometimes students barely make it to bed with homework alone. If you threw in community service on top of that, image how little sleep students would get.

Community service should be a choice, not mandatory. Sometimes students serve the community with the little things they do every day, like RELATIVE_NAME's challenge says. Clubs and organisations are important to a student too and with community service around there would be no time. Some students might not even do the service at all. And it takes too long which may result in sleep loss. I hope you take my views into consideration.

Gratefully,

I know that you think that it is right for all of the students to do community service. In my point of view i don't think that all students should be forced to do the work if they chose not to. Don't get me wrong it is a good reason and is also for a good cause, but some people don't see it that way.

First off some kids may have important things to do other that community work. Many students could be involved in sports,clubs,or any other types of organizations. I myself play sports and do other activities, so most of the free time i have that is how i spend it. There could be other personal reasons some students chose or decide not to participate in the work/community service.

Some students may not want as well like to be forced to do the work/community service. They may think that their time does not have to be wasted doing the community service, and it would not be right to force them to do the work. Also we should not be required to do the work because we go to school to learn get a good education and make something or to better ourselves. So the service would not have anything to do with any of these thing so why should me and my should have the choice to do the community service if we decide not to or to do the work.

I think that you should not require all students to perform community service. I think this for many reasons. One of the reasons that i think that all students should not perform community service is because some people might not have time to do community service. For example if a student is interested in their sports career and they have to do community service they probably won't have time for their sports career. Another reason is that people might not be in the condition to do community service. For example a student might be disable in any way and they might not be able to do things that community service requires. Also one of the most common reasons is that they might have other things to do. For example they might have to do chores.

I have many more reasons why you should not require all students to do community service if i was to tell you all of them i might be here all night but one thing i have in mind for you to do is give extra credit to the people who do community service because they actually care about the community.

Students should have to do community service for discipline reasons only. Most student should want to help our community and help keep it organized and clean. 95% of the student would love to do community service but, 16% wouldn't enjoy doing community service either, because they have other things to do like go to the mall or go to friends houses or they just feel that community service is for only nerd's or losers. Well i think that 16% of our school should be the ones helping our community every Mondays and Wednesdays and also on weekends. Other wise the rest of our students love to do community service they love to help out with things that are needed. For those 16% i really believe they should go out and do community service for discipline reasons like say if your walking down the hallway and you see a student disrespecting one of the teachers all you have to do is walk into that room and say you have community service this amount of days or weeks. Once you've told the student their parents will get called and inform them about what their child has community service for doing that was out of line toward someone else. So say if you catch a student writing in school property that student will automatically have community service for 2 months or however many days weeks or months you deicide to give that student.

I think all of the kids in our community should do community service whether its with younger children or even just picking trash up along the road side. I would greatly appreciate for you to support my ideas that i am about to share with you.

The main reason i believe that we should support the idea of community service is because it shows responsibility and respect for the community we live in. Helping other people that could not help themselves would show great citizenship.

There is not just helping people for community service. You could pick up trash and let people know we are serious about being a clean town. Sometimes community service is the best for kids with problems because they don't have a roll model in their life at least a good roll model that can set good goals and responsibilities for them.

These are some of my ideas and opinions about community service being good for us. I hope your found an interest in my thoughts and ideas on community service.

I think that students should be able to choose weather they want to do community service or not. Its not fair to just make the whole school do community service, because that is how you feel. Some students may have very important places to go or things to do for example, they might have to go to a therapy for a sickness or go see they're dad who they haven't seen since they were five years old. Don't get me wrong I see where your coming from, but not everybody feels the same way about the community. Just think of how many students would do the wrong without adult supervision. Most students would do bad things just because, that's just how they are.

It would cause to many problems then you would have to call their parents and explain why you have just let their child leave school. If they found an important item, they probably wouldn't tell an adult what they found. It could be money, a ring, maybe even your car keys from three month's ago. The students start yelling or playing loud music and interrupt some bodies nice evening. Which would cause many complaints. Students that play around to much could get hit by an on coming vehicle. Then, you would be accountable for their medic bill. Their parents could try to sue our school for money we may not have and then you will be fired. It wont be fun at home with no job just watching T.V. getting fat off of ice cream and cookie dough. A lot of kids would be sad, because you are good principle who everybody likes and to see you go would make us sad. If we had to go to a different school with teachers we don't know or may not like us our grades could drop tremendously.

The kids you have known since sixth grade may drop out as where you have made us happy to even think about school. I think community service would be a good idea if they could on they're own time, but since your going to make all the students do it you may take time out of their day. Worst of all some students may not even show up which could be a waste of your time. I feel that you should think about this very hard and that you need to think about how many consequences would be this project.

I think that all of the students that are able to do community service should be required to do at least 9 hours each semester. If they are able to take away from the community they should also be able to give back. Each student should learn what hard work is all about. Some people like to take the privileges and things that we have for granted. I think that by enforcing the community service they will at least feel good about themselves when they ask their parents for something they want. For example, how would you feel if you were a parent and your child would always ask you for things that sometimes are out of your reach? You would probably try to work hard to get your daughter/son that toy or object that they desire so much. Well, what if your child becomes greedy and selfish as they grow older because you didn't teach them the value of everything that they have. You just gave it to them as soon as they asked. Now, what if you gave them everything that they desired, but with the agreement that they would help babysit their small cousins, or help their elderly neighbor clean the house. Then, they would learn the value of things and feel about it when they received what they asked for. In today's society many people are taking advantage of the fact that they don't have to give back to their society or community as much as they take. If you make community service a requirement not only will you be giving our school a good name, but you will also be molding the students into good citizens of the world. You will be instilling in their minds that it is always good to give back to the community and show the world you care. I hope you really take these points I'm making into consideration and I also hope you put yourself on the other end of the stick and pretend (as i mentioned before) that you are a parent with children that always ask for things that are sometimes out your reach. All I want is for you to make the best choice that you think possible for both the school and community, but if you do make the choice I am giving to you here on this letter I can almost reassure you that you won't regret your decision.

I have been thinking about how you want us to do community service and I was going to say I have many things to do and that will take out most of my time for studying homework and many other things i need to do in my day. I disagree with doing community service on school days maybe on weekends or days we don't have school or during school. I just need more time in my day to study and do home work for school. I also need time for my social life not cleaning and helping other people.

I have to do my chores and homework before I can do anything after school so I can do good in school and the other day I got in trouble for doing community service and was late for dinner and got grounded and I didn't have any time to study so I got a very poor grade on the test. The community service was very hard and was way out of my level I was very upset when I couldn't even do what was told and got in trouble for it!

The best time to do community service is when you have the time to maybe on weekends a and days we don't have school. Also maybe having a choice of what we do in are community service last time I had community service I couldn't do it so I took longer and was late for dinner and got in lots of trouble. My parents don't even want me to do community service any more because it takes out to much of my time. That is why we should have community service on weekends when everybody has time to do community service.

I need to study a lot more than usual the state finals are near and I haven't even studied and if i fail my parents will hold me back and I don't want to repeat 8th grade again. the best thing for me is to have community service on weekends in the morning so I can hang out in the after noon with my friends. I have barely gotten any sleep for the past week staying up and studying. I really hope you will give all of the students a break with community service. I have heard kids in the hall crying cause they were so stressed and tired about finals.

To many people our world has become a giant trash can, and that is not good for our planet. Requiring all of the students to perform community service is a great idea for many reasons. Following through with community service will provide animals a better home, more people will want to live around here, and over all just make the world a better place.

First of all community service will provide animals a better home. Trash lying around could hurt animals. For example, plastic can holders with the holes in them can hurt Dolphins. If Dolphins get there mouth stuck in it, their mouth will be closed shut and they can die. When trash is lying around animals home they don't have a place to sleep or take care of their family. It is very hard for an animal to live when our world is a dump.

Second of all, more people will want to come live around here if our planet is clean. When people are searching for a nice place to live in and they see trash everywhere its not very welcoming. They won't want to live there, they will want a nice place to live in where everything is clean and not disgusting to look at every time they walk outside.

Third of all, Our world will just be a better place. More people will want to vacation her or live here. The more population can mean the more buisness or money. Going to the Beach on a sunny day will be more exciting without trash lying around when you just want to play in the sand. Walking to where you want to go instead of poluting the earth will be more peaceful and nice without having to dodge trash on your way.

In conclusion, that is why i think we should require the students to do community service. It will give animals a better place to live, more people will want to live around here, and it will make our world a better place over all. Maybe you should consider this idea. People will appreciate our community service because it will make our planet cleaner!

You are about to make a deciding between whether to make your student.

Perform community service . to whatever decision you make you will always have your good and bad reaction. So know whatever you pick people going have a opinion. Now i am going give to difference reason on both sides.

Now i don't think you make kids do community services for a number of things.

NUMBER ONE: You don't how the family life is out side of school they might be deliver with some problems and they don't have time.

NUMBER TWO: Kids should have the right to do community services. If they want to do it that's there thing . that what they want to we should force them i know you have the right be they have there own right.

Now if they want to do community service then ha who stopping them.

But if you do force them they probably learn some thing and when some try new thing they have fun and things like that.

I am writing this letter the ask you to make community service a requirement for all students. I think it would really help our community. It would even help the students by teaching them things they cant learn in school. You can even give students extra credit for outstanding participation in community service.

Students would benefit from community service in many ways. One way I can think of is if a student works at a nursing home. Working their may teach them manners or respect for their elders. They may even hear some old stories from some of the seniors living there. Another way students could learn something is from cleaning up a park or beach. They can learn about our environment and learn how to clean up after themselves. They might even start recycling if they don't already. Some students may even help the school by maybe helping in the cafeteria or helping the janitor clean. Some of them may even help in the library or help a teacher with something. There are so many ways the students can help that I can't list all of them. I don't think there is enough paper on earth for me to do that.

In conclusion these are my reasons for supporting your idea for community service. It can help make our town, school, and lives much better. I think you have a very good idea and should follow through with it. Maybe our school or students will even win some kind of reward for our community service. Thank you for reading my letter.

61112AD2A25E,"I would like to take the position on whether students should be required to perform community service.

Yes, they should do community service at least two times a month to make their environment better around them.

It would help them to be familiar with by the time they are grown.

Some examples are, going to clean the church, picking up trash in their neighborhood and most of all picking up trash on the football fields.

Some of the students can go clean up the church.

It is very helpful that they can clean up the church.

Cleaning the church will help you be more apart of doing something with your church members.

If you pick trash up in your community it will not be so dirty.

Helping the environment around you clean can make others wanting to clean their community.

Keeping a community very clean will make the people around you help.

Cleaning the football field clean will help your school be more clean.

I think keeping the football field clean, people want talk about your school so much. A nasty environment some of the older people do not like at all.

It will help them to come out more and keep our community clean

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think helping out in the community would be fun.

To me helping people out is a good way for people to get to know you.

It also helps make out world look better!

I think you should have the school adopt a road and help pick up trash that people have left behind.

It would be great for people to understand that just because people in jail are doing Community Service doesn't mean that its a bad thing to do.

I think if you required us to do Community Service that maybe at first not very many people do it, but i think in the long run a lot of people would join.

Second, i think Community Service would be great because most people in our community that are doing Community Service are the people in jail.

To me when i see people doing Community Service i think of that too.

But if you get more kids to do it, people will realize that, Hey maybe this would be good if all people did this.

Also the air we breathe in wouldn't be as polluted, and if we got together people not in the school district ,but out of our town it would be a lot cleaner.

I understand that maybe it might be a bad idea because a lot of kids my age have a lot going on like basketball, baseball, football, school work, and much more.

But i promise if you just did this like once a month when there is nothing going on I'm sure there would be no problem.

Also even if there was a practice on the schedule, the coach for the team or whatever there is a practice for the he/she wouldn't mind them doing some community work.

All i have to say, I think this would be good for our community, and you have my vote!

I do not think that requiring community service for students is a good idea. First, this will take time away from homework, studying, and extracurricular activities. Second, some students are in more sports, clubs, and activities outside of school than others, and wouldn't have much time for extra community service on top of that. Lastly, clubs are made that require community service in some schools, instead of making everybody required. If you required community service at our school, it wouldn't be a smart idea.

First, requiring community service for students will take time away from their homework, studies, and activities outside of school. Any student who is struggling to stay on top of the work load would start receiving failing grades because they get less time to study for tests and finish homework. Students with other activities going on would be rushed and stressed, as opposed to if they chose to join a club or group of students who wanted to do the community service.

Second, some students have more work, activities, and sports after school than others. For example, if some students have multiple sports, harder classes, and jobs before and after school, then it isn't fair to require them to complete as much community service as other students who get off with easy classes, and no sports or clubs. This new rule would be unfair to certain students. Maybe a club that requires anyone who isn't already in a club or sport to join and do community service would be a better idea.

Finally, requiring community service for all students is a bad idea. This would take time away from homework, studying, and any clubs or sports the students participate in. It would be unfair to the students that are involved in many other activities, as well as the students who aren't in these activities. A club that students could join voluntarily would be a much smarter choice. Thank you for your time.

A723DDC8ABF0,"Dear Editor,

Community Service has always been a debated issue between students. Some find community service an enjoyable experience while others think that community service takes up too much of their free time. I agree with community service being an enjoyable experience. It is a relief to know you can make someone else's life easier and it's an exciting feeling to know that all the hard work you put forth will be appreciated. However, some students find community service boring and something will take up too much of their free time. I do have some suggestions of how we can fix this problem, but I believe that community service will be a value to our education and should be required by your school.

Community Service is basically helping others in a way where you accept nothing in return. Some activities that are community service include picking litter up around your neighborhood, visiting the elderly, helping a teacher, etc. It's the little things we can do. Community service will be beneficial to our school because it will help the students learn self value. The reason for this is because the student may learn that just by helping someone that it can mean a whole lot to that one person; which may or may not lead them to realising the important things in life and the things they value. The student might find community service as 'fun' if we advertise the activities in a way that will make them think of enjoyable and not hard work or boring.

Then there is the issue of students believing that community service takes too much of their free time. I feel for this we need to have a limitation for the amount of hours required. In consideration to my previous statement, if we make the activities seem more like a hobby instead of a chore then students will be more willing to join in. Then, maybe, this will cause a domino effect where one student will tell their friends how exciting community service is and this will lead more children to participate. For Ex: When a group of students are going to clean the litter in their neighborhood, they could make this into a sport. Where the kids grab the trash, like bottles or paper, and they throw it into the garbage bag or recycling bin as if they were playing basketball.

Most students find community service important because there are many advantages to it. Like if students help tutor kids; this will be beneficial to those kids who can't afford it or really need it. Then there's helping a teacher out, even if its just sorting her books or organizing her papers; this will make their lives easier and that specific person may start to gain a friendship with the teacher. The reason for that is you will see that teacher for quite some time and the two of you may speak to each other and carry out conversations with one other. Students can also visit the elderly which can be an amazing experience; the kid can teach that elderly person a few things and they might share their experiences, knowledge, and tips. This can lead to a friendship where both parties enjoy each other's company.

For such reasons I believe community service is something that should be cherished      ",5,Community service,Independent

I would like to take position in weather students should be required to perform community service because I think that we should do it not only for our community but for our nation, family and friends because it is not fun to litter and we would be doing you a favor. So elementary student go out and help our communities. Trust me you will always have the time to go out and do what you want to do.

so come on and let us help out our community by cleaning up in our home towns. If our school did this as a group project we would not just be helping ourselves but a lot of people , animals, and countries. We could even recycle bottles newspapers and cans.

Please let us go out and help our community, and save the lives of many creatures I don't just want my school to do this I want everyone to help make a difference in the world if everyone cleaned up a little bit every day I promise you we will be a happier and cleaner nation.

I think we should make it required that all students perform community service. Some people may think that it takes too much time, but i don't think so. Yes, it does take time away from things you want to do, but helping people in need is probably the best way out.

Taking part in community service helps people in need or helps the community in general. For example, we could help clean up litter on our school grounds to make our school look amazing and make it better for the environment. The school could tutor the elementary kids with math and reading.

Community service is a awesome way to show that you care about your surroundings. We can show that we care by planting flowers in front of the school, picking up trash, recycling, and many more. If we all work together and try to make an effort then we can do community service all the time.

Making community service required sounds like a good idea to me. It could help people, the environment, maybe even the world. People aren't even trying to do it today. Making it required could help that. It could push people into helping others. Eventually we could not make it required and it wouldn't be a problem, they would see that community service is fun and it makes you feel good inside.

FEEBBB786DFA,"Dear, Principal

Community service shouldn't be required. To many kids wouldn't have the time. Its should be the child's and parents child whither the kid would or should have to do community services.

The reasons I say this is because most kids have a full schedule between school, homework, chores, church and outer family events. Many kids if they were required to do community service wouldn't go and fail or would go and not get there homework done many kids do a lot at home, and most kids wouldn't have the time.

If kids were required to go and do community serves they'd bring a negative altitude putting everyone in a bad mood. Making it miserable for the kids who actually want to be there. Many of my friends do like to do community serves they enjoy it and commit to it.

Not everyone is going to need tutoring and trash clean up, we all work together as it is to keep this community clean and safe as it is. Why put teenagers in a position in where they are not wanting to be there or are not wanted there?

This couldn't be child labor by the law since it's community service but to the teens us it would be just like it because we would be forced to work and we wouldn't be getting payed yes it would be for the community and to make out living environments a better place, but why force someone would could care less what actually happens? I know if i was forced to do community services and i dint want to id bring a negative altitude because as a kid you are forced to do things you do not like. Why add one more on.

Making children perform community service would be unfair and unreasonable to make us the teens do community service if we do not want to perform the task.

In my opinion, I don't agree that students should be required to perform community service. If they want to do a good deed and decide to, than that is their opinion of choice. But requiring them to take time out of their busy schedule, and making them do something they really don't want to do is unusual punishment. Choosing to help the community and help to save our environment is a very noble thing to do. Others don't agree that they should help because they have much bigger requirements they must attend to. They might have to take care of a loved one who is very ill, or perhaps attending to work just so they can keep the lights on. High priorities like those can not be put on hold. Others might disagree with my opinion, but I'm standing by it.

What you are doing is a great idea. But some students it may not be possible for them to do community service. For instance some students are in athletics. This will take up a big portion of their time and energy. Not to mention they still have to do their homework.

Another problem may be that they have to take care of a sibling while their parents work. This may not be a problem for some, kids can go to day care. But others don't have the money to put young kids in a day care. So you would be taking away from the family in the process of helping the community. If money gets tight they may have to resort in getting a job. This will take up a big chunk of their free time and put more stress on the student.

It may be in your best interest to keep community service optional. If you do add it as a requirement student's grades will drop and students will have a difficult time paying attention in class. The reason is they will be worn out from staying up late finishing homework after their sports or jobs, and their community service.

Community Service is a very important aspect of life.

As a firm believer in this, I would ask you to consider that all students of SCHOOL_NAME take part in community service.

As Christians, we are called to administer to the needs of the poor, but if this school is not pushing for it than how are we fulfilling our duties as Christians?

Whether it's working in soup kitchens downtown or helping babysit a neighbor, we should be striving to answer our call from God.

I have done community service with my peers and during my experiences, I have encountered many people from various ages, genders, races, and social classes.

From every trip I have gained a valuable experience.

During one of my experiences, I was working in a soup kitchen in downtown Cleveland.

Although intimidating at first, I helped by serving those who didn't have the same gifts I am blessed with.

Isn't that what we are called to do?

Serve others like Jesus did?

I learned from this that every human person is valuable and should be treated with dignity and respect.

Wouldn't you like all of the students at SCHOOL_NAME to participate in such a great journey of faith and attempt to carry out what we are taught by Jesus Christ?

I believe by helping our society to become a better place is why we are put here on this earth, but we shouldn't be wasting our time and talents by selfishly keeping our gifts to ourself.

We are called to share those gifts with others.

Simply, I am asking that you implement at least ten hours of community service for the entire school year.

Dear principal,

I hear that you are deciding whether or not to make community service required in our school. I don't think that you should do this and I have many reasons why.

My first reason is that doing community service is supposed to make you feel good and make you feel like your doing something really nice out of the goodness of your heart. However, by making students do community service you are going to take that feeling away. They will be forced to do it and will not feel accomplished. They will feel like its a chore. When they grow up and they aren't required to do community service anymore they probably won't. As where a student who is not forced to do community service will probably grow up not thinking of it as a chore. They probably have a better chance of doing community service when they grow up too.

My second reason is that when children are forced to do something they don't do it as well as they could've. They will act spoiled and will not even bother to help in the community service. They will treat it like a chore and not even care about what there doing or how there doing it. They will cause a problem and may hurt someone. You have to want it and if you don't than your not going to work hard for it.

My third and final reason as to why I think you shouldn't make us all do community service is simply because me and my fellow classmates need to figure this stuff out on our own. Just as you and your family did.

We need to learn that life isn't all about us. We need to learn that we can't be selfish, and we have to think of other less fortunate people who can't afford anything we have and that we have to help them. Or we have to clean up the town a little. You have to let us figure this out on our own. Just as everybody else did. It will help us in the end.

These are all of the reasons why I strongly believe that you should not require us to do community service. I thank you for taking the time to read this message and hope that you will make a good decision.

I think students should require to perform community service because it would be a great learner quality and it makes the community a better place to live.

If nobody did community service then the town would have trash and all kinds of junk around it.

I think that community service would be great for example , cleaning up a grave yard would be nice for the families relatives that died.

Maybe if you just picked up trash or put new flags in for the veterans who have died in the past year.

When people do community service it makes a big difference to people and the society. Also, if only a little group performed this task then there would not be a lot accomplished and everyone wouldn't `t appreciate as much as the people who did it.

Students should be required ti perform community service. Helping the community is very important. You might get sick if you stay next unclean air or place. If you think that it takes a along time, we can do it in groups. It's really important to leave the earth clean. We are the ones who make the earth clean or dirty place. If the earth is clean that means were clean. The earth represent who we are. So let them go to a feel trip to the ocean or beach to clean the trash that some people leave behind them. If we don't clean the earth, we will be stuck up eating with unhealthy things. And the trash from the floor would go to the ocean.

What about factories and cars, they are responsible for it to. And if you don't let them clean up the earth or the school, they would live with this trashy air and place. Imagine what it would be like to have those things. Then it would be hard to clean after your self. So think about it.

I know it will take some time to clean up our school and community but it is well worth it. If people and kids keep littering the world will not be safe for us to live in and many people might get very sick and even die!

Cleaning up the community is good because it will allow more people to move in our neighborhood and that means that it will be more families with kids and we get to hang out with them. Another good reason for picking up trash is because some people might come and visit our community and might not want to come back and visit it again. I would like them to go back home and tell their friends and family that Columbus is a great place to visit. I think if kids get caught throwing trash on the floor they should pick it up and pick up the rest of trash outside at our school.

Helping kids will be good for the community by helping the younger kids by passing the test to get on to the next grade, and so that they will not struggle in the next grade. It will provide the kids to get good grades and make there parents, teachers, and their school happy. So if I was the principal I would choose to make all students help out their community.

I think community service is a very good and helpful thing for the community, but I do not think students should be required to do community service. It may help the community if students were required to do community service, but many students choose to do community service voluntarily anyway.

When students do community service voluntarily they usually feel proud of themselves after they are done. They know they have helped the community and this gives them a sense of accomplishment. If community service was required in school, students that did community service by choice anyway will not feel accomplished after doing community service if they had to do it. This takes away the feeling of accomplishment, and discourages students that used to do community service to do community service by choice anymore. Then all students will probably only do the bare minimum and it will not be helping the community since barely any people will do community service.

On the other hand, the students who thought community service was a waste of time, are probably students who do not do their homework from school anyway, so they will probably not even do the community service if it is required. So by adding community service as a requirement to school, it is not really helping the community, because just a few more people will be doing community service, and most of the people doing the service will not feel any sense of accomplishment. Also, the people who used to do community service will probably lessen their amounts of community service because it will not make them feel proud, so they would feel they are just doing extra for no reason.

Community service is a very good thing to do, but I really feel that making it a school requirement will decrease the amounts of community service that is being done by students. As I stated before, requiring community service in schools will make community service stop being an activity that students enjoy, and so they will stop liking to do community service; which will have a bad effect on themselves and the community.

I have realized that you are thinking that students are required to do community service.

What i think you should do is make them do community service. It be a great learning experience. Kids like myself would learn true values of being helpful and also learn respect.

They might not like it at first, but eventually through time they will become better students.

Kids grades might improve by learning true values of respect and education. Every day most kids in about 53.7% don't have good grades and this could make that percentage go down. Just think better grades also means more money for the school.

I think that you should have kids do community service. i know it makes me feel good inside the work itself seeing people smile is the greatest reward of all. The kids hopefully will like that just as much as me. That in itself is why the kids should do community service. I know you will make the right decision, good luck and be grateful.

Some of the other students and I do not think that it is fair for you to acquire all of the students to do community service without us accepting. For example some of the other students parents may not allow their kids to do community service because they probably have chores at home. The student may have a younger sibling and may have to watch them after school or during the weekend.

Other possibilities is that the students may have another job for extra money like babysitting or the student may have a lot of things on his mind such as projects for school or something and may be more focused on that than the community service itself. Some of the students may not feel responsible enough for it and may think he wont do good enough or they will fail the task.

I also think that the students will want to choose if they want to do community service or not because i know that you especially don't want the students to go on strike and skip class on to go on strike against the principle of our school and get suspended or expelled or anything like that. Also if you could make an announcement about doing something else like help out or give some new ideas for our school like school dances or a fundraiser for our school and get new school supplies for our budget and everything like that.

I hope this letter has changed your mind on making the school do community service and let kids choose if they want to or not and if you don't change your mind we will just accept what we have to do.

9B42B1750AD8,I don't think the principal should make the students clean up litter or do community service because they might have other thinks to do with their family's. Elementary students can probably do it because they might not have anything to do because they still in elementary and they probably have time to pick up litter or maybe jr high students can help too if there not to busy maybe some of the students that don't play any sports can probably help too. In some schools the principals are probably gonna require all the students to do community services because how they probably act or maybe she or he gonna make they bad people do community service. People like me can probably do it on weekends just to help others because im always busy during the week. The principals should make the people who act bad during the week and during the weekend that will probably help them change a lot they gonna get tired of picking up litter and doing community service.,2,Community service,Independent

I feel that everyone should not be required to do community service. I feel this way because community service should be a volunteering thing. The work will get done faster and have better quality if those doing it want to do it. The work will be sloppy and take a longer period of time if people are being forced to do it.

Perhaps if the number of volunteers is too low to participate in the service then try to get more people to help out by motivating them by offering rewards for their service. You could always try connecting the service with school by offering extra credit for those who participate. Or the class with the most helpers gets a pizza party. Trying things like this would increase the number of workers and the work quality.

If you would be interested and/or if the school budget allows it you could try paying students for their work to the community. Say for every job they complete they get three dollars, or for every hour of work they get five dollars. This would really increase the amount of students and the quality of the work.

If you would try forcing all students to work most of them wouldn't show up. The last thing a lot of the students would like to be doing in their free time is helping the community. So most won't go willingly but again if you try to force them they will most likely not show up.

One thing you could try is all the students that show up and work for a total of say six hours will get a free day. On an upcoming Friday the students that work for six hours or more will get the whole day outside to just play out on the field.

1365F7051B17,"Dear principal i do think that we should help community service. I mean look at our economy, scientist have been saying that we have little tiny holes in our hemisphere because of us littering. You would think that after us hearing about that we would care more about earth and would start throwing our trash away where it belongs. My opinion schools should have the kids like once a weak pick up trash around the school, and during summer plant flowers and maybe even trees. The state should give the schools money so we can help the earth. Also instead of throwing our garbage in a hole why don't we burn it?

What we also can do is help stores and banks. Why don't the state just pay for heavy duty windows and doors? If they care so much really they should do that, I mean yes people now a days are stupid and if they want to be stupid then they can be sent to jail i understand that but, when we can just make that certain stuff so that stupid people wont be taken from their families.

For all the students out there in their schools that don't get taught well we should do something about it then just standing around. I mean like my school, a lot of peoples grades are down, not just cause of the students but because of the teachers. For example one of my teachers when i raise my hand for help she helps me on a completely different topic that i never asked for. I think that we really need to take a foot down and have the state help us with what ever that we need. Also in SCHOOL_NAME they complain how the students are failing a lot of the classes, but to be honest if they care that much they wont give us super hard problems on the test and homework, and for the algebra students teachers give them homework that the teachers hasn't even gone over.

Community service is very important for our community. It helps our environment and the community. Many people around the world participate in all the community service there is to keep this world healthy for us to live in. We can find many things around our community to help out with. Even if we don't have much time we can help with the simple things there is to do.

I think students should be required to have at least 17 hours of community service. But just for their last year at the school. It shouldn't be mandatory for those students who are in the lower grades. The school should make students realize that we need help in the environment and laziness from them wont help.

For community service students can help to get the hours they need to get in to clubs, school teams, and school participations such as SCHOOL_NAME, the yearbook committee and student council. I think community service to me is not a waste of time, i like participating in anything that will help my community and myself.

For example the community service stuff we do is collecting can goods, tutoring for students, helping teachers on anything they need, Make a Difference Day, Red Ribbon, recycling, helping with student council and helping out in our school community.

I think that it would be a really good idea to make students do community service because, they can learn a lot of things in life, it will also help them with meeting people in life. You should require students to complete students to complete about a total of 30 minutes of community service per day. They should have to do this for a grade kind of like reading logs that are due weekly. Here are the reasons why i think they should have to do this.

The first reason would have to be about learning life experiences they could learn about how bad some people treat earth and how much litter is all over it. They could maybe start a anti-litter group. They could get kids that are in the group from all over the world and, they could even get those kids to help clean up earth.

Another reason is that they could help tutor younger kids or help out in elementary school and help out the teachers. This would also help them in life they might get a since of pride knowing that they might have just changed a little kids life. They might even want to become a teacher when they get older.

My last and final reason is that they might also be able to volunteer at a vet. They could help save a animals life. I know a lot of people that love to be with animals and take care of them. They might grow up to love animals and maybe become a veterinarian.

Those are my 3 reasons on why i think you should require high school students to have to do community service. You could also make it a rule for them to have to take about 50 hours of community service total in a year for students to graduate 12th grade. Thanks for taking the time to read my reasons.

I believe that students should be required to participate in some community service. I support my idea of having students participate in community service with evidence from my life.

In my life i think that i have done over 100 hours of community service. First of all, I have been a helper and a actor in a play at my church for a week of the summer. This experience changed me and made me a better person.

If we had students participate in community service we may be able to change how some people live. We may be able to get them to change there ways and stay out of trouble. If we required ever student to have a said amount of community service hours than they would have something to do with their time so they could stay out of predicaments that they should have not be in, in the first place

Another example from my life is the time i spend being a teachers assistant at SCHOOL_NAME, a Japanese summer school program. I started this program when i was in the 2nd grade. Naturally when i was younger I had always wanted to be come a teachers assistant. This program takes 5 hours of my day, for three weeks, Monday through Friday. This has saved me from getting in a lot of trouble.

From the example in my life i clearly stated why we should require a certain amount of community service hours for our students. First, it can make the teens better people. Second, it can change the way people live and treat others. And finally, the teens will have a better chance of not getting in trouble because most of the day will be filled with extra activities.",3,Community service,Independent

I think that all students need to do something that helps the community. Whether it is picking up trash or helping other in their work. If all the students do a community service, the community will be cleaner and better. There would be little or no trash on the streets. People could help other people with work.

It might take up some time, but it will help the community. Some work doesn't take very long either. If you decide on picking up trash it will only take twenty minutes. If you tutor a student it will only take one hour. Community service is not a waste of time. It will help a lot of people.

If we would not have community service, the streets could be filled with garbage. There could be students that don't get help in their homework. That could cause them to get out of school and not want to learn. Those kids could turn out having a bad life.

There are no reasons to oppose on community service. bad things could happen without it. So I think that every student needs to perform a community service. It will help the community and the students. It will also help the people living in the community. Things will be better in the community.",3,Community service,Independent

I believe that making all students perform community service is not a good idea because that should be the decision of the student or parent. Students come to school to learn, not to do community service. The time that would be used to perform community service can be used to make sure that students are not confused about any academic topics. This time should be used to give students more advanced lessons that might help them in the future. If students perform community service, they might not be thinking of a having a good future. Students go to school in order to learn academic lessons that will most likely help them in the future, not to do something that people who perform crimes usually do. It is fine a child wants to do community service on their own time, but education should come before any other activity, even though it is an activity that helps the environment. Community service is a great way to help the world around us, but when it comes to a situation like this we need to be a little selfish and think of ourselves before the environment. Students should be trying their best to build a better future for themselves by working hard at school. Parents should make sure that students have their mind focused on their future, and after they make sure of that, it is fine if a student wants to go out and help the people and place around them. Teachers should try to keep students focused on getting a good education. Many students today are doing very poorly in school which is why performing community service will become another distraction that avoid students from performing well in school. As I mentioned before, education comes first. All children deserve to have a good education and a bright future which is why we should not allow any child to be distracted by any other activity.

I am a representative of the many students in our school. Being a student myself, I understand exactly what my fellow classmates are thinking. And I believe that students shouldn't have to do what they don't want to do. So, I'm afraid to say that I'm against making it mandatory for students to do community service. My reasons for this decision are that students already have enough to handle with homework, some students aren't exactly good with helping other people, and some students just plain live in a bad neighborhood.

First off, I would like to say that students just don't have the time to do community service. The amount of homework the average student receives a day is enough to last them until dinnertime. That ranges from three to four hours after school ends! And by the time they actually have time to do community service, it's already dark. Including the fact that most students are involved in sports and clubs, it could be nine P.M. before a student has any free time of their own. Also, having students do more than what they already do for school after it's over will put them in a lot of stress. Students are already stressed with what they do now. And stress causes bad moods and bad grades. So really, making community service mandatory would end up doing more harm than good.

Secondly, you have students who aren't good at helping other people. They may not get along with people, such as those who prefer to work alone, or they might not be able to do any service because of diseases. Some students have Diabetes, preventing their blood pressure from getting too high or low. Others may have Asthma, preventing them from doing to much work. Even still, there are students with many other illnesses that can and will prevent them from doing work. Students who just plain don't work well with others shouldn't have to. Instead, they should be at home working on any projects that come to interest with them.

Then we have those neighborhoods where it's just not safe to leave your home. This may be because of gangs living in and around those neighborhoods, traffic, or bad neighbors. I know that you only want the safety and wellbeing for you students at school, but why not at home too. Don't make them go out into a street filled with cars or guys with weapons just to do some community service. Is a school assignment really worth the safety of your students?

So, as you now know, students don't have the time for community service, they may not be able to do community service, or it may be endangering their very lives. These are only a few of my many reasons for going against mandatory community service. Think about just how many students you'll be causing problems for. You might even lose future students if you make community service mandatory. Be sure to consult me on any problems you may have with my ideas, and please, please don't make any rash decisions.

I believe that community service should be required for many reasons. One reason is it is helping our world become a better one. For example, picking up liter on the side of roads or in parks this is helping our world from global warning and making it cleaner for were we live. Also community service with helping people inst that difficult for example like helping someone get their groceries out of their car or helping an old lady walk across the street that's doing community service but its also being a good citizen and something people should do on a daily basis. I think community service would be a great thing for students in our school become better people and think different on some things. I believe that community service isn't taking too much time away from other things because it is still something important that you should be doing and if some people think that then maybe only do community service for a half hour each day or when you have more times on your hands do it for and hour but other then that it shouldn't be taking away from anything too important because you are helping people that is also one your priorities or should be. Community service should also make you feel good about yourself because you are helping others, so i don't see why anyone would have a problem with doing this.

Do I think my peers should join community service? Yes, but they don't need to. Why do I say that they don't need to, because my ''friends'' don't need for someone to tell them if they should help out their community or not. Its only respectful to help out your elders when the need it, or to help out another buddy when trying to find a weapon in a video game. Right? And another reason is because kids don't like being told what to do or when to do it. I should know, because I am a kid. And if you force them to do it, it's only going to make the situation worse, and then there will be violence. And isn't that what we are trying to get rid of? I mean if you really want kids to help out the community just tell them, if someone needs or ask you for help stop and think, ''What if that was me needing help?'' And also people will think good of you and respect you. Because that's all kids want, is for people to respect them. But most of all they want to be someone.

Dear Mr. Principal,

I believe that students should not be required to do community service. It is their choice. If they want to, they should but you can not force them to do so. I also believe that you should only make students who have gotten in trouble or been bad to do community service as punishment if you want to. This will help the community and make them learn their lesson. For an illustration, if a girl or a guy gets into trouble instead of giving them detention, just make them help out the world by doing some community service. This explains that it will benefit you and your world. This also illustrates that this punishment is better because in detention, you do nothing and just keep quiet but with this, they actually do something which would make them very sore and make them never want to do it again. I believe that detention rate might go down because of this. Time is very valuable which is why community service should be a choice.

People who do community services for free I believe should feel happy with themselves and shouldn't care what other people thinks. For a demonstration, if you have done something good and you friend told that it was a waist of time, you shouldn't care what they think. This explains that if you don't care, they might stop since people will stop if you show no reaction. This also explains that people can feel happy with what they do no matter what. This is why people shouldn't care about how people judges them.

Community service is something people do voluntary, not something that should be required. Students have other things to worry about such as studying, homework, chores etc. There is already a lot of adults who volunteer for community service, and there's people who by law are forced to. Kids on the other hand shouldn't have to. Students don't need something else on their shoulders, school is for learning and nothing else.

Students have to study no matter what. Community service is like an obstacle that prevents kids to actually study. Already there is many students who don't study at all, and making all students do community service would discourage the small percentage who do. Doing things like cleaning and taking care of younger kids can be tiring. Even adults get tired of doing these things, imagine how a minor would feel. When a student is tired and has the choice to study or not they would most likely rather not; well after so much work they have just done. Not studying can lower test scores, and not to mention lower student grades.

As studying weren't enough of an issue, with all this community service where can a student find time to do their homework? Of course, those who choose to volunteer for community service find their way; they figure out their own schedule. But what about those new goer's? A change of schedule can be very frustrating, especially when it means doing your homework late at night. There's another reason why it could affect the use of homework. When you have such a tight schedule (which can be harder to those who play sports or clubs) your only option is to do your homework at night. Which is really bad because students end up having less hours of sleep, which is required for a good healthy day. Homework should be done right after school, but with this new task it wouldn't be possible.

What about certain chores students have to do at home? Parents as we all know are very strict about chores, and when a kid doesn't accomplish them, parents can get really mad. Of course you can prevent that by actually doing them in first place; but what if you have to community service first? Your parents might understand the situation you in, so they'll probably post pone ""clean up"" day to the week end. Which is the only days a student has to forget about their troubles at school. There's another reason, socially this would ruin social activity after school; since students have to study, do their homework, and do their chores all before bed time. Chores is enough, why do city chores the community already volunteers for.

In conclusion, i believe the idea of making students do community service is absurd and completely irrational. Students have social lives they need to fulfill. Our tax money is going to the cause anyway so why bother. People get payed for this stuff so it shouldn't be a privilege. Community service just shouldn't be required in school, it should be voluntary.

I have been informed that you are a bit shaky on the decision to make community service a requirement to the student body or not.

Also i think it would help students stay on the right track in their lives and not get dragged into drama and all the non since that goes on in schools these days. Plus i bet that the students will come to like the fact that they are really making a difference in our community. Think about it this way, the students of your school being on the front cover of the newspaper for cleaning up the beach. They could also volunteer at a nursing home and just help the older people around, talk to them, and just make them feel loved. I mean if i was in an older folks home and i didn't get visited very often and these really happy, smiley children came to visit me it would totally make my day.

I think that students should only be required to perform community service when they are needed to or when wanted to. For example: ( If they have done something wrong to the school property they would have to clean up what they have done, or the students should be required if the are willing to do this kind of job to stand up for there community.) Mostly some students would love to do community service. Just show people how much awe they can show. I think it would be best for having volunteers to show up to do this kind of utilization.

This would help community be more of a clean place to be in if students are able to do community service in a plausible way. I would think that all students should not be forced to do this, but they should be offered to do it.

I heard about your new requirements on community service and students in our school performing community service. I just wanted to give you my opinion on your expectation and I think it isn't a very good idea for it to be mandatory to perform community service. It gives less opportunities for students to succeed in their goals, and it takes out our free time which gives us time to have fun and learn new things. This situation should be handled wisely.

If students act on doing community service, they will have less opportunities to succeed in their goals. For example, if a student wanted to learn how to play an instrument, they wouldn't be able to learn it because there would be no time for lessons. They would have to be doing community service which would take away the opportunity to learn. They also have many other responsibilities besides community service such as taking care of a younger sibling, focusing on school and education, house chores, and many others. Community service would be another responsibility that a child would have to take on and which maybe not even be prepared for.

Community service would take out students free time to have fun and learn new things. Students wouldn't be able to have fun and enjoy their lives if they are stuck doing community service. They wouldn't have social time to hang out with their friends. They wouldn't even have time to be with their family as much. Children would be very miserable and would be very depressed at a young age. They wouldn't have to much of a great memory as a child either.

Community service isn't a very good thing to make students perform at an early age. It takes away time and opportunities and gives too much responsibility to students. Students should be able to enjoy their childhood and not remember it as cleaning up litter. I don't think you wanted to remember your childhood as a community service worker. I hope you take my opinion into consideration and reconsider yours as well.

I think you should require us to do some kind of community service. community service helps build character and helps people be understand some things. I think we should do community service because all of us needs to help out the community we live in. Some people does not like the place we live in but there are places way worse then us and we could help make our community or even state look better if we did some kind of community service. We should all give back to our community for all it has gave to us. If our school does some kind of community service then that could inspire some people or even another school to help out then it would be a domino effect. I think if people don't want to help others then they should never get help. Some thing we could do is plant flowers and trees, clean up trash help other people with jobs like building houses or even giving money to help with a soup kitchen could help a lot. Things like that could go a long way. You could help some one find a job so then they are not depressed and they have some thing to live for everyday or help feed some one that could some them there are some more nice people in this world and he could be inspired to help more people when he is able to. If some people doesn't want to help out then that's there lose to an amazing opertunity like this.

Students all across the nation are doing community service to help out their town or city. Whether it is cleaning the streets, helping out in an old peoples home, or tutoring children at a school, all these deeds are good experience and good for the community. I think that it should be mandatory for all students here at school to do these good acts upon or society.

One reason why I think that we should have mandatory community service is because it provides knowledge and experience for the child. this is because after hours of dedication to helping out, children will see what good they are doing for their friends, family, and other acquaintances in the town. Also, there is a high chance that kids that are not heading the right path, will steer into the lane of success. By doing this, they see how they make other happy around them and will start feeling better about themselves and have a much greater respect around elders. To end off on this knowledge I would like to add that children that to participate in this will have a wider and more open mind. They will be open to new ideas and will learn something along the way

Another reason why this community service is necessary is because this provides less work for older, more delicate people, and more work faster and harder workers such as students that are in high school and college. While doing this less older people will be injured in activities such as cleaning the streets, their homes, and helping them with buying supplies needed for their health. This will cause a chain effect on them making them pay less for medical bills and more on other things such a necessities and other good that will help them through everyday life.

My last reason is because this will provide a cleaner and safer living area for little children and growing teens. By cleaning streets and parks, children will have a safer environment to live in and will grow up living in a much nicer area. It is a non-arguable fact that if a child is born and raised in a safer community, free from dangerous litter, they will grow up to be much healthier. From poisonous gasses and rodent killers, to little things like sharp glass and aluminum cans everything will be cleaned up. This prevents choking hazards and toxic fumes to be entered into a child's system.

As you can clearly see, Mr. Principal, community service is needed for three clear reasons: it helps children learn and experience the outside world, it helps the old people community, and makes it a safer living area for little children and adolescents. So please Mr. Principal, make community service mandatory, for the greater good of our living area. Just think about, would you want your kids to grow up in a dirty town?

I think community service is very important to our city because many cities are filthy and dirty and need cleaning, if we can get the whole school to do it, it would be great, and it would also become a good opportunity for our city, but i don't think it would be fair if the whole school is forced to do it, i would prefer if you were to make a list so people are free to sign up if they want to join community service.

Another example why community service shouldn't be highly instructed is because some kids might have some important things to do at home and might not have free time to help the community. Also not many kids have time to help because of all their homework and chores they might have at home.

The list would be an excellent idea because the people that sign up would most likely have time to help and would probobly be dedicated to doing community service. Although not many people would be doing community service you would know that the people that signed up are a dedicated group of people and would be glad to help.

Many people don't know all the pollution that is out there is killing animals and slowly destroying our planet' soon our planet will be completely a mess and would be a horrible place to live. Many people don't believe in global warming but there has been some evidence of global warming. One piece of evidence is there has been a major decrease in water. The water level is lowering and will soon be completely gone, witch will then lead to death.

Many people argue about this but all this pollution is doing a lot of harm to all the living things in the world. these are some of many reasons why we need community service so i hope you take my advice and use it for future reference.",3,Community service,Independent
64EB5FFF3DB9,"I believe that students in our schools should do community service. One reason is because it helps or makes the world a better place. It will make our schools look disgusting to everyone else. It also makes them think about the future in areas.

We are helping the world so much just by doing one little thing. Anyone can do this but people today are getting lazy. This will help so much if everyone picks up at least one or two pieces of trash a day. It is not hard to do this task every day. It will also help out animal such as squirrels, cats, dogs, and other things as well. Because to them every thing or anything that smells good is food so they will eat trash and other things.

Another reason is that it changes the look of the school, or other places. No one wants to go to a school that has trash everywhere on the floor. It would just make the school look bad that no one wants to go to that school. I think that everyone does not want to see trash everywhere they step.

Last thing is that it open young peoples minds. If they see someone picking up trash, it may give them an idea. One of the idea is them thinking about the future and how the earth will look like in a few years.

We can't change the world unless we change the thing around us. If we don't start soon our schools will look awful. So can we start or do we have to wait?",3,Community service,Independent
B994BEE43F58,"I think students should have to perform community service. A reason I think students should perform community service is because they can get a chance to help in a way. When students do community service they might be making a difference in someone else's life. For instance, help feeding the hungry will have them not hungry at least for that one day. That might make that person do something good that day.

Students should want to do community service. I think students should want to do community service it helps them on their college application. For instance, if I put in a college application and I had a lot community service time and my major was working with people, they may give me a scholarship. The college will see that I like working with people and you enjoy do it. So students probably would want to do community service it will help them when they are applying for college.

Students should be required to do community service because it's a way to help others. If you do community service they will have soup kitchens and things where you can learn to help others. I think if students learn to help others early they will do it when they get older. For example, if someone never help someone when they young, they certainly won't when they get older. So I think students should be required to do community service while they are young.",3,Community service,Independent

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

It has come to my attention that you are trying to decide whether you should or shouldn't require every student to complete some sort community service.

Well, I would like to sway your position to requiring us to do so. There are just so many benefits that come from doing this.

Not only are doing these things helpful for us learning to interact with people we don't know but we also are given the chance to give back, know we are doing something good, and learn how to work together to reach a common goal.

In our everyday lives people are always helping us in so many ways, it is only fair that we try and do the same for these people and others.

It would help us appreciate what other people do for us so much more, and it would allow us to give back to the people who are always helping us and the people who are no longer capable of helping themselves.

Participating in community service also helps us create a better community and meet new people who are also interested in helping others.

If we all have to do this, then our classmates would be able to learn about each other and bond more along with meeting new people in the community.

This is vital in a community, because if people do not know each other and can't work together then clear decisions can not be made and everything will begin to degrade.

Not only does it help up with this bonding in community, but it helps us make a happier and cleaner community, because you can fix many issues through community service.

By requiring community service, you also get many people out and doing something good rather than sitting at home watching television, or committing crimes and participating in other mischievous things.

To give our school a good reputation we want involved students who do not get in trouble and have helpful things to do rather than sit at home doing nothing.

It would also get many people out of the house when maybe they have issues at home.

they will be able to meet new people who they can hang out with and instead of sitting in a bad situation they can be helping others.

As far as continuing our education, many colleges now have community service requirements based on the number of hours of service you have completed.

So, to continue on to get a full education you must have these, even the smartest student. If so many colleges provide this requirement then don't you think it's pretty important.

A college would not make this decision unless it truly was important, and if you want to have smart well rounded students in an environment working together, you should require service hours.

We need leaders in out community and leaders need to be educated, so requiring service hours will help us int he future,

Please consider my idea of requiring the service hours, because i truly believe that it is very important and an integral part of our very lives.

I honestly think all students that attend SCHOOL_NAME should have too participate in collecting community service hours. I think that because our community needs things done and kids could get fit while helping the community. Plus its like a bonus because the community and the students get something in return. While the community is improving the students are getting community service hours. For example the community has a lot of trash and other objects needing too be cleaned up. If the trash is cleaned up then maybe it could even reduce some of the pollution in our community.

They could also help by helping kids in elementary with what their seeking help in. That would Increase the community's education level. It would also keep some kids out of trouble. Instead of kids getting into trouble and wasting there time they could be helping the community out, and getting community service hours. They also wouldn't be wasting there time because their helping the community they live in out.",2,Community service,Independent

I think it should be required that all students should perform community service because it is a very good thing that us as children should help others and the planet. If those that do attend are doing a good job at helping the planet and others. I think those who do help should clean up any mess thrown on the floor, on the road or just left somewhere. We can stop wasting water by turning off just a little bit of water dripping from the sink or shower head or even the water hose outside. We can do so much that can keep us active, healthy, and we would be doing a very good deed for the planet. Helping some younger children learn by tutoring them on a subject or teaching them how to help the community in doing community service. So i think that even just walking some dogs or helping an elderly cross streets is even just helping for the community. So i think that all students here and there should do community service it can be a good thing that some students will experience. It can even change some kids lives on how they help the community.

Community service can be good for people with spare time but others have no time for something such as this.

Like if you play sports and have practice from right after school to about 5:30 and then you try to do community service.

In my opinion students should not be required to do community service but every few weeks we should have a sign-up sheet for a certain service that people may participate in.

I personally have no time for community service because of all the homework I have and then on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I help my dad coach my brothers soccer team.

Maybe in the beginning or end of the year when nothing is going on everyone could do some kind of community service to help out.

Most students whether it be in school or out of school have so much going on or just don't care about doing community service that they stay home and play video games or watch television.

Community service could be as much as making sure that when you roll your car windows down that no trash in your car flies out.

Most kids help the community in little ways like this and don't even now that they are but it makes a big difference.

Some people love to do community service and every minute they have free they take there time to help somebody.

If you have nothing to do after school then you may need to do some community service so that the community can be clean or tutor some kids, because it can all make a difference in your community.

If I had time on my hands then I would do community service but I do so much already I have no time at all.

On the other hand making kids do community service no matter what could be a good thing.

It would show them that there is much more than just being a kid and trying to get away with stuff.

Like every month the school could pick one service to make a certain grade do and then we could make a huge difference.

So then again maybe we should do community service.

I think you should put all of 8th grade to work for community service. Community service helps the world stay clean. It does not really take away too much time away from us because it even helps us in our house so trash will not really come in front of our houses. That is how some accidents can happen here in United States because all that trash on the floor can cause car accidents. Let me tell you how they can happen. First of all the trash is on the floor and a car comes and does not see it and they hit it and then the car flips over if it is a tire or a big box of clothes or toys in there. We the 8th graders can change the whole world by being the ones to volunteer to help our world.

If you have any friends that always litter the streets then tell them to stop and pick up what they just threw and go throw it in the trash. Well i hope we make our world better as each one of us volunteer to go help the world and pick up all the trash that we have thrown on the ground. Imagine all the creatures in the water that are seeing the trash in the water that we have thrown in there. Imagine how much trash we have thrown out there in the world. Just imagine how much we have done to the world. Working together makes the job go way much faster and that really helps our community get cleaner.",2,Community service,Independent

In response to the Community Service activities, I think that community service is voluntary and should not be forced to do unless you have committed a crime and are required to do hours of community service. If students are forced to take time from themselves in order to make the world a cleaner place then that is not right because this is a free Country and we should not be imprisoned to listen to everything and do everything that an authorised figure asks us to do. You can make the work extra credit. If you do not listen to this request than my friends and I will gladly go on strike, transfer, or not show up to school until this issue is resolved. The new building for SCHOOL_NAME is not finished yet and the community service will not be either if this community service is not avoided. The workers on the new building get paid and we will not and we come to school to learn not clean!

I might seem a bit outraged by this and I am because scientists are always saying we need to make the world cleaner, but Barrack Obama says that the kids are the future. I am growing up quickly and will be in High School next year, so i think i can make my own decisions when it comes to this.

They would lie about what they did for community service. Most people would like it for extra credit for certain classes. Other people want it for 100% of their final grade in all of their classes.

Community service is a really great thing to do in life. Most people in this community are in need of help. Helping the community makes the world a better planet to live on. It is really easy helping them too. For example, things you can do to help the community is to go to the hospital, babysit, and visit the sick to volunteer. By volunteering, you are supposed to help people out by working for them for a couple hours a day. I require all the kids in in school to be required to do it.

When you go to the hospital, you can help the community out because in some hospitals there are people that live there because they are too old to take care of or they have some kind of mental disability or illness. The people there are usually just old with some sort of sickness. It is hard for them to be able to do actions we are doing because they don't really have enough strength to do actions us, children and teenagers can do. It is good to help out because you can change there life in a better way.

When you babysit, you can really have fun with the kids you are with. You can see and learn everything about a kid. Most of them are very fun to play with however, there are a few that give you a hard time taking care of them. Parents usually ask you to babysit sometimes because of the work times they have or when they have to go to a party together. If you really enjoy being with kids, this is something to do.

When you visit the sick, you can really help them turn a frown upside down. By this quote I mean that they are all usually sick and in pain most of the time. They really don't like having to deal with the fact that they can't do what cured people can do. You can also talk to them and tell them about your life and learn a little bit of there's. They always like having someone to talk to.

In my opinion, I think volunteering is a brilliant idea to do. i think it's a good idea because you can change a life and you can make the planet a bigger and better place to live in. This is why I require all the kids in this school to be required to do community service.

C83EB6623D24,"Dear Principal, it would be very beneficial for our school to participate in community service.

I see a community were there is no trash in the roads or fields, there are kids helping their elders, and even students wanting to help the community, this can be us. Some of the activities that would easily be assessed are cleaning up trash and caring for the elderly.

To begin, picking up trash would be good and easy to participate in because it can almost be treated like a field trip where students will be brought to a designated location where clean up is necessary and the students will clean up the roads and fields to have better land and less global warming because of the littered trash.

This form of community service would be easy because it would take less than two hours, so the kids can leave the school and come back in the blink of an eye.

Pursuing this further, another easy and good act of community service is looking after and taking care of the elderly.

I believe this would be easy but a little more difficult to plan the picking up trash because the students will need to leave and come back from the homes of the elderly at different times so most if not all of the elderly citizens of our community can be helped and cared by the students at SCHOOL_NAME.

In a result there would be less fatalities of the elderly by falling because of the students with them to help care for them.

In Conclusion, I believe I will soon be able to see the day where our community is safe, where there is no global warming happening, where the streets and fields of our community are free of debris and the elderly are not frightened of getting too old where it is hard to see or walk because they will have children to rely on.

I strongly think that community service is a great thing for children. If you required for all the students to perform in community service, then it would help the community out and even help the students out at home. For example, if a student had to clean up litter daily then they would realize it makes the community more neat and clean and they would start picking up around their own neighborhood. If that was the case, then there would be a bigger population in the town because many family's would want to come to a neat and clean town. The students who don't think community service is a good idea then once they do it a few times, they will realize that community service is very helpful to their community and their selves. Everyone would be very appreciated to have a clean neighborhood and like to see that there was no trash around the interstate or the roads. The tutoring also would be a great idea for the students. The parents would like that very well because the students would most likely bring up all of their poorly grades they have on their report card. Also to this idea, you would have a very good reputation of your school because all of the students would bring up their grades. This also would help out all of the teachers so they wouldn't have to go over the lesson several times a day. So it would make their job much easier with them knowing it from being tutored. The students would be glad too, getting to watch the T.V more often then what they do from always being grounded. The community service in that way would help the students out when they get older. There are many other ideas for community service you could also do as well. For example, cleaning the bathrooms at school, helping teachers out when they need help, helping the cafeteria ladies make lunch, or making sure all of the students cleaned up their mess after they ate lunch or breakfast. I believe that requiring community service for all students would be a great idea for all of the students in school.

I do not think you should make it mandatory for everyone to do community service for a few reasons. The first is because you shouldn't make someone do something they really don't want to do even if you think it is good for them because you are not there parent. Another reason is because if you make people do community service they will do the bare minimum of work that they are suppose to do or teach a child how to do math wrong, or read words a different way then everyone else.

If they are cleaning up trash i doubt they would do all the work they're suppose to. I bet they might only pick up a couple pieces of trash, and complain about it the whole time. I understand it might help the community a little but if they do no work or teach a child who's learning to read the wrong way it will take so much more work to help fix what that person has done. I get that your trying to help, but all i think it will do is make things much worse for the school and the community.

I also think that you should make as much school time as you have to do actual school work. You could open up another band class or give us study hall sense we don't have it or maybe make home base even longer. Find another way to help students and the community.

I am writing this letter to discuss about weather we will have community service or not. My opinion is that we should each get certain hours of community service. If people do community service then it will be good for the city or town and the little kids.

I think this because kids should be taught things that they don't know so they will be better prepared for the future. If kids were in third grade and they got taught things outside of school about fourth grade, they would know more and it would be better for them. Also when you touter older kids like eight graders. They should be prepared for high school. If they are, then they will do good and they will succeed and not be very busy with homework that they don't know how too do or that they don't get. I would like to be better prepared for high school myself.

Also people should clean up liter to make the town or city cleaner and a better place to live. If people didn't clean up then they wouldn't be able get places without seeing trash.

Or they will be walking in trash all the time. If this was the case would clean up the city right away in my community service. What if the mayor or even the president was coming to the town or city and they saw all of the trash and garbage everywhere. they wouldn't think much of the town. if the town or city was clean and neat with not a lot of trash around and with people to clean it up, the president or the mayor would like the town or city and give it money and advertise for it so that it would make money.

That why we should have community service for the town or city. If we don't then our town or city will be uneducated or dirty and unclean. so let there be community service.

Community service is a great thing to do it makes you feel good and it also helps build character for example it can build leadership skills. I think that students should at least have to do one community service project because then they can see if they like it they might change and start doing even more community service. Another thing it does is if the students don't like doing community service projects and its not the thing for them at least they gave it a shot and helped out people during their time.

You should have kids do some community service projects because it builds character. Lets say your a kid who doesn't like to help out or is really sad all the time by helping out those in need you can feel really good about helping those people. Another thing is if your not a good leader and maybe you are picked as a leader for the project it would give you a chance to build you leadership skills. I wasn't really into community service projects but I helped out once cooking with my dad for a party at the senior center and i felt really good once i was done.

For those kids who still don't like community service projects they should still be happy that they managed to help out those who really need it that's more meaningful than sitting on the couch and watching television all day. Also for those kids who don't like community service projects you should still urge them to try it again and maybe after a while they'll grow on the idea of helping out those in a time of need. Students who don't like doing community service should still be acknowledged for their effort and maybe that could possibly be a motivator to try it again.

As you can see we have kids who do like to do community service projects and kids who don't. I think you should require the students to at least do one community service project. You should do this because it can help build some character and leadership skills and it may turn kids who don't like to do that kind of work and maybe make them want to try community service again.",4,Community service,Independent

From what my teachers have told me you are deciding whether all student should participate in community service. I believe that all students should engage in community service. I believe student should participate for two reason. the first reason is it would give the students something constructive to do after school. The second reason is the students may find a way to make new friends.

First, students should participate in community service because it gives them something constructive to do after school. Most students want to go home after a long day at school. The students will go home and do their homework and watch their favorite television show. instead of doing these lazy activities, they could help better their community.

Doing simple thing like babysitting, walking neighborhood dogs, and helping people do everyday tasks could help their communities in a great way. Doing these activities may help them see problems in the community. If the students see the problems themselves then they would be more likely to help fix the problem instead of just sitting idly by, making the problem worse.

Second, students should participate in community service because they may make new friends. People like to do different things with their free time. Getting involved with community service could actually be a way to find something new that the student would enjoy. Someone with different interests would be able to find an activity that they enjoy. hanging out with people that have the same interest would help a student make new friends.

In conclusion, I think that students should engage in community service. Students should be involved with community service because it would give them something constructive to do after school and it would also be a great way to make new friends. Seeing their communities be better off because of what they did could possibly make a difference in the child's life.",4,Community service,Independent

What's a better way to make our environment a lot healthier and safe? What could we do too make sure our community safe and environment friendly? There is a lot of things we can do. But there is only so few Elementary, Middle School and High School students who actually take the time to help out their community.

If everybody spent a half hour inside or outside working too make the community look better, they would be happy with what the results would be. Then everybody would help more, which would allow them to work for longer.

Although when it becomes hot out, we would probably rather want to be hanging out with your friends or swimming. The best way to be active is playing outside. Who ever said that doing community service meant we had to do it alone, or with people you did not know? Bring your friends and family members into it. Instead of only working at school, take your work home with you. Having friends and teachers is the best way too do something you don't really want to do in the first place. It gets your mind off of what your actually doing, before long the half hour goal you set soon becomes and hour.

Even though community service doesn't sound like the most greatest thing in the world, look at who and what your helping. In the future it will make a difference. It will be a chain reaction, as soon as you start helping around your school and neighborhood more and more will do the same. Maybe you could start something knew around your community.

February 18th, 2011

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

With the deal about community service is that it should be optional. Why you may ask, it's simple. I thought that community service is supposed to be about caring for others. It shouldn't be about forcing kids to do it but it should be about it coming from the heart. When something comes from the heart it tends to mean more to others than forcing them to do it.

Ask anybody, there is more to wanting than forcing. Trust me I've learned the hard way. If you force them to do it they won't like it. But if you suggest it, they might like it!

One time I was at a girl scout meeting and we were deciding what to do for St. Patrick's Day. Our troop leader FORCED

us to do a charity party and to tell you the truth I hated it! But you know what, over time it got better! We ended up in doing 6 charity drives raising $7,872!!!

Then This year I proposed a St. Patrick's Day party at a local nursing home. Oddly EVERYONE liked the idea. So lately, all we have been doing is getting ready for it. I mean how often do the elderly get visitors!?!?!? I hope this party turns out to be fantastic!!! and with everyone in such a happy mood what can go wrong?

not all student show be required o do community service. First of all is because some student don't have time to do community service. Second of all community service is a personnel choice you don't have to do it unless you get in trouble with the law and they make you do it. Third of all why would you even make student do community service if they don't want to ?

Some student cant even do community's service because they don't have the time. Some student play sports out side of school. Some kids have family problems at home and have to resolve those and don't have time for community service. There are also student that have homework or that are studying or getting extra help from a tutor because they don't get a certain subject.

Student also have a choice to do community service you cant force a student to do work. The only way you can do that is if they get in trouble at school or with the law. And if you were to force students to do community service a lot of student would leave your school and go to another where they can just learn and be with friends and not do community service. Now there will be some student that will volunteer because maybe they have extra time on there hands and are bored and figure why no help out but you can not force anybody to do community service.

I also have a question, why would you try to make students do community service? There already at school 5 days out of the week and do homework everyday and a lot of student play sports. So not a lot of student would have time to do this. that is why you should not make student do community service it should be a personal choice.      ",3,Community service,Independent

Community service is great for students. It helps us understand what is going on in our community and how to help it. In every grade of school, students should be required to have at least a few hours of community service. It even looks good on an application to get into college. Community service also shows us that we are proud to be where we are and what we have.

First of all, community service lets us understand how we can help out in different ways all around us. From helping serve food at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to just helping pick up trash at our school. We can grow into being a better person knowing that we have helped. It can shape us for when we get to be adults in the world. Helping out in our community shows us what is happening on all sides of us.

After students graduate high school, most of them are going to college. When they get an application and fill it out saying that they have helped out in there community, then the college will consider even more to accept them. It shows that, that student is willing to help, work, and be a good person. Colleges want students who are smart and nice and who love to help out.

Helping out in a community not only helps other people, it helps you. Most students say that its to much work and we don't get anything from it. That is not true because we do get something from helping out. We get the feeling of pride and joy knowing that they have helped someone with less things than they have. You get a feeling that nothing else can really ever replace.

In conclusion, I think that there should be a requirement of at least a few hours to help out in our community. It shows us what is happening in the world around us and how to help it. Community service shows us how to be a better person and how to embrace being that person. Not only does it look good on a college application but it helps shape our lives in ways we can never dream of.",4,Community service,Independent

There has been a lot of talk going around about if you're going to decide to require community service or not. So, I decided to write this letter to you hoping it will make your decision a little easier. I would agree, that there is a lot of controversy over this issues.

My opinion on this issue is to require community service to all of the students of our school. Community Service is just helping out the community, but its also helping out helping the person doing the service. The individual student may not realize it, but community make the place THEY live in a better society. If it didn't it would be called, world service. Everyone doing a little bit can make a big impact in our community.

Some students may say ""but, I just don't have time"". In most cases this is a lie. What these kids are saying is, on a rough estimation, in 3,600 hour school year the don't have just 10 hours of that time to give back to their community? I find that pretty hard to believe, and I hope you would to. I have to agree that students lives are very full these days, but the can make time for their community that makes there lives full. On my opinion on refusing to do community service is either the person is lazy, or just plain mean. The students may not realize it not, but community is definitely worth their time. After doing community service, the students will have a satisfying feeling, knowing they did something good, and benefited their community. You never know, they just might like community service.

I want to thank you for reading this letter and hearing what I have to say and my opinion on community service. I hope this letter will make your decision a little less stressful, either option you pick. You do a great at your job and I know you'll make your decision for the better of the school. Thank you for reading this letter.

TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard that you are thinking about making community service a mandatory requirement. As you know many of our students already volunteer in our community, but many also don't. This is a shame. Community service should be mandatory for our school because, it will give students a sense of community, it will help put a good name out there for our school, and students will get a sense of how lucky they are.

Community will help give students a sense of community because it will give them the chance to work with people who are helping the community. They will learn more about what is wrong with our community and how to change it but also what is going right with our community. They will be able to say i helped that person in our community or I made that park nice by picking up trash. Students today do not have a strong enough sense of community they don't think or know enough about what goes on in this community. And you have the power to change that. Making community service part of school would help students understand what it means to be part of a community.

People always think of middle school kids in a negative light. They think we don't care about the community. If we volunteered as a school we could change that. People might say hey that school has good kids. They might be more inclined to come to school events or to give money to the school for new laptops or desks. People would see that we do care hey and maybe some people who don't volunteer might say if kids can do it so can I. People need to see that kids care to and that we will do something. If people got the chance to see what a good school they are then maybe they would give us grants or participate in school concerts and activities. Volunteering will help people see what a great school we go to.

Kids these days often forget how lucky they are to have the things that they have. Like a flat screen T.V., ipod, or a Wii. But if kids got to volunteer they would see that some people are not as fortunate. They would understand how lucky they are to have what they do. Maybe seeing this would make them want to give back more. If kids got a better sense of how lucky they are they would be able to mature faster and people would respect them more. If volunteering was part of school kids would get a better sense for how lucky they are.

To not make Volunteering mandatory in our school is not only making the kids loose out but you are also making the school loose out. Lets show people what a great school we are. the only things that can come from volunteering are good. If volunteering was part of school kids would, get a better sense of community, put a good name out there for our school, and get a better sense of how lucky they are. So what's to loose!

I think your idea about community service is great. Most children need tutors or help with homework. So if you don't mind i have some ideas on how to help our community succeed. For example i think putting straight A+ students with kids who need help with homework or if they need tutors would be one major step in our community becoming even greater. My next thought would be making our streets cleaner, some of these slackers in the school need to do work so having them clean would be a great idea. My last thought would be to put athletic kids to work making sure our communities people stay fit and healthy, maybe setting up athletic projects around campus would help?

So i have proposed ways to help our community. I know they all sound terrific but just make sure you to give kids time off. So here comes my next thought, community service is great i am with it but us kids need time off because trust me, were are not super humans. To add on to it we need time off community service, two or three times a week sounds good. All of us have chores around the house so if somebody can't make it you cannot get mad all they have to do is call in. On top of it some people have family to visit, sports to do, and need free time to hang out with friends.

Now ill tell you why i think wee need community service. First of all i think so many people are lazy and just sit around all day doing nothing. Next thing is that so many people just through trash all over the place and never in a trash bin. And my last thing is that so many kids are not getting the education they need its terrible. I think we should to have more people helping kids become smart young people than being idiotic in school sincerely, a caring student",3,Community service,Independent

I think that all the students in the school should do community service at school and at home. helping the community is very important, in fact i did community service when i was in elementary school. In the sixth grade i was in a girls club and every Friday we would go to the Ronald McDonald house and help out with the planting and the cleaning. After it was all over we would get rewarded with a treat and a prize so that we wouldn't feel like we did it for nothing. You should tell the kids that helping the community is very fun and it keeps you community clean so that it wont be looking nasty and filthy. On a personal note I would enjoy helping the kids with the gardening and the and the cleaning because it will help them see that even older people can do it to.

Helping the community is very important because it helps the community look like new. If you keep the earth looking filthy the that will start pollution and that is very bad for the community. It will start to get foggy all the time and the earth will start to stink and it will mess up the roads and the grass. I don't think the kids would want that will they? Sometimes you have to get off your back and clean up. it will be a great experience for the kids because it will help them realize that helping isn't such a bad thing and it will make things a lot better for them. You should go for the chance and see what will happen if you make a right decision. My mom always says that helping is a nice way to winning someone's respect and attention. My mother is a wise women and she always knows what to say. In fact everyone's parents are very wise and intelligent it's just that the children don't see it yet.

The children are so caught up in video games and T.V. that they don't realize what they should do at home and in the community. So take the chance and try to see if they will help out or cop pot on what they're suppose to do. Just take my advice: "" There is no way out on what u do in life"".",3,Community service,Independent

I think that all students should be required to perform community service.

I think that all students should be required to perform community service because it is a great way to give back to people that may be less fortunate than us.

Community service is also fun to do.

I have helped pack for soldiers overseas and it was a blast.

There was a live band and after I was done I felt like I had really made a difference in someone's life.

I think that we should be required to do community service because it helps others in so many ways.

Just shoveling a neighbors driveway or side walk could mean the world to them if they are injured or elderly.

It would just take an hour out of your day to shovel someone's driveway and would help them dearly.

Also, the students may see how lucky they are and may not take as many things for granted.

Now since I have done community service I now try to not take my home, family, and food for granted.

Community service also teaches you how to work together.

When I helped pack for the soldiers there was a huge pile of boxes that had to be filled and shipped.

I remember thinking that we could never pack all those boxes in just two hours.

But, by working together the volunteers and I we were able to pack all the boxes with time to spare.

All of these reasons are why I think that the School should be required to perform community service.

I do not think that students should have to community service because students might not have time to do all their home work. They might not have enough time to be able to any thing they want to do. They might not have time to go out and eat with their families. if family is coming over that they have not seen in a long time they will not be able to see them. this would not be fair to some families that live really fare away from each other. this could get in the way of sports and after school activities. This might make people have to quit some after school activities. this would be hard on the students because they would have to stay up late to finish their home work. this would mean that more students would show up to school late. This would also make a lot of students fall behind in their school work because they would be to tired to do some of it.

This would not be fair because students would nit be able to do anything that they want to do. they wouldn't be able to do these things because they would have to do Community service and then when they got home they would have to do home work. the students would not be able to go out side and have fun with their friends. i think that they should not have community service as a normal thing. i think that if the students do something bad that that student should have to do it for like a week or two depending on what they did.

CE4EFA6441C4,"Yes, I believe that all students should do community service. We should be required to perform community service because it will make a cleaner environment, the town will save money, and it is my personal values.

First off, with community service, the environment could be much cleaner. We could have kids volunteer to clean up some local town parks or the school. Some of these services could be picking up the trash along the road, or recycling. with all of the cleaner parks, many more people will go outside and enjoy fresh air. A lot of people in town have dogs, and walking them could be a pain. Sometimes there may be broken glass on the side walk, that could cut the dog's paws. This can be painful for the dogs and it is not safe. Therefore, We should be required to perform community service because it will keep the environment clean and safe.

If our school instilled community service upon us, it would also save money. For most problems, the town pays people or a business to the job. But if we had volunteers to the job for free, the town and school would save money. Maybe with the surplus of money, the school could put it towards sports or something new they would like to start. I think if there are leaves that need to be picked up, or if there is some snow in a parking lot, I believe the students should be able to work together and do the job. The town would save a lot more money if they just required students to do community service.

Being required to perform community service is also one of my personal values. I believe that all students should be required to do community service because it just makes the community come together. One day during the fall, I raked an old lady's leaves, not expecting a profit. When I was done, I felt good about myself. Though she gave me money anyways, I still did it for the good of the community. Nowadays, there is a lack of discipline being taught to young children. I believe doing community service would also teach the students life lessons, like responsibility. As you can see, community service would be good for our town.

All and all being required to do community service would help out this town in many ways. The youth would be taught valuable lessons, and life skills. The environment would also be cleansed of the trash, as well as the school and the town would make money.      ",5,Community service,Independent
A80C4DC0E796,"To the Principal:

Community service is a very fun and easy way to learn about volunteering and what job you want to have when you get older. Many kids in our school believe community service is a waste of time and that it s boring. Others feel differently. I believe that community service in our school should be required so that students can get a good work experience, do a good deed to the community, and learn while they are doing so.

In our community there are many jobs and places to go for volunteering. Hospitals, schools, pet shops, are all examples of places young adults, like ourselves can learn and have fun at the same time by volunteering. Taking part, and working hard to help your community is very important, and lets face it. When we are doing community service, the community is thanking us, at a young age, for helping out.

Making this mandatory at our school will give us a chance to have a work experience. We can learn what it feels like to have a job and get ""payed"" for it, with community service hours. We all know that no body wants to get a ""summer job"". But you know what? If you go to a summer camp regularly, why not try volunteering at one? You could finally be in charge and take an initiative to help little kids have safe experience, and have fun at the same time.

If community service is required during the school year, i don't think that to be a very good idea. I believe that requiring about one-hundred hours in the summer would be enough. Why? I believe that kids my age like to procrastinate, in which if you only give them a little bit of work, and a lot of time to do it, they will wait until the week before school starts to do their hours. Also, requiring it in the summer will give kids the will to do something instead of sit there and watch television while eating, and then finally going to sleep at the end of each day. Wouldn't you get tired of having the same routine every day for about 80 days? I would.

Another problem in our community, that is becoming very severe is obesity. Kids are sitting down doing nothing, while stuffing their faces with junk every day of the summer. With community service, this will encourage kids to hop off the couch and go do something whether its walking the dogs in the neighborhood or running a marathon for cancer. Requiring community service will allow kids to get up and do something with their lives.

Furthermore, I think that requiring this will help our generation greatly. It will prepare us for the real world and what's coming next. If we don't prepare ourselves, how will we know what to teach the next generation, after our own? Also, community service is just a downright good thing to do. You are helping your community in a way that you cant imagine. Its just another step towards the future.      ",5,Community service,Independent

If every student worked at least half of an hour a day in the community, Corona would be a cleaner and safer place. I enjoy community service because it makes me feel like I'm helping the community. Everyone should help out our community one way or another.

There are many ways that students could perform in the community. Some ways are; cleaning up trash in the park, volunteering at an animal shelter, or even donating items to those who need it most. I have much experience in volunteering because I used to be a Girl Scout. When I was in Girl Scouts, I helped clean up the beach, sorted items at Goodwill and much more.

Students in Leadership here at SCHOOL_NAME are required to volunteer in the community.

Many of my friends are in Leadership and enjoy performing in the community. If I had the chance to volunteer in the city of Corona, I would be honored to.

Students could even help in the areas they enjoy the most. I enjoy cooking, so I could volunteer at the soup kitchen serving food to families in need. Some other ways you could help are sports. Some people could teach students

Helping other people that need help is nice because they might need help with their kids when they are working or they might need someone to take care of them when they are busy.

I think that students are required to perform community service. If we don't then all of the students will focus more about themselves then others. A simple task, like picking up trash around the neighborhood, if not done then our streets will clog up the streets and it would be hard to get around from one place to another. Another example is tutor little kids with their work. If they don't get help then there is a slight chance that they will not get to higher grade levels. There is also some more consequences for not doing community service. Also I think we should offer some rewards like stickers or pencils. There are some people out in the community that need are help and we shouldn't just ignore it.

Some people even do community service, but they don't do their share of it. They just basically do some of the work then just leave to do other things they want to do. I think we should put consequences for the students that bail out of the service their doing. Some ideas for consequences should be more homework, stay after school for a little while, or put community service as a grade. If we do that then students understand why community service is important. So in conclusion, I think we should require all students to perform community service.

Community service is a way of giving back to your community. It's hard work, but it also can be quite interesting and fun! The students don't know what they are missing out on! Which is why you should require students to do community service hours. Some students say it's boring or it takes up too much time. Most of the students who say that haven't even done community service before. How do you know if you will like something if you haven't tried it ever before? There are many options to choose from to get the hours needed. Students can pick fun things to do, and end up helping out in the community. Some students can even make long lasting friendships with the people they help or the people who are working with them! It is a win for everyone!

As I said before, how do you know if you like something or not when you haven't ever tried it before? The answer is you don't know. So students who say community service work is too hard or boring have no right to say that. Most of those students haven't even done community service, and those who did didn't pick something that they wanted to do. They had the wrong mental attitude. If you go in to this thinking, ""I just got to get this over with,"" you are set on the track of having one long and boring day. Trust me. Community service can be very fun; all it takes is a positives attitude.

Choosing the right thing to do for your community service hours is a key ingredient to enjoying community service. You have to do something that you like in order to fully enjoy your time. Students don't understand that there are many other options than cleaning up trash on the high-way and volunteering at ""old folks"" homes. I do community service at my church by helping out in the nursery, and volunteering for

Vacation Bible School. VBS for short. I get to work with kids, which I absolutely love to do, and I'm helping out my church community also! You should try to make it clear to students that they can choose fun things to do for their community service.

The best part of community service is making long lasting friendships with the people around me. The children I sung and danced with at VBS are now some of the children I babysit for. I met a bunch of girls my age there who are now some of my closest friends. And it was all because I helped out at VBS. I know a bunch of people in my school who love making new friends! This would be a great opportunity for them!

In conclusion, community service is fun! You get to help out your community. You can do something you love to do. You can discover a new passion. And most importantly, you can make new friends! That is why you should make it a requirement for us to do community service hours. I hope you consider my opinion. Thank you!

I hear that you are debating on making the students in our school do some kind of community service. There are benefits and drawbacks to that plan. Let's start with the drawbacks, or disadvantages.

First of all, many kids don't want to take time out of their day to help the community. Even if it's something as small as just taking out the trash. Kids these days are extremely lazy. But, it all depends on the task, and the person. Also, some parents don't support their kids in doing after school activities. If a student had a difficult service, some parents wouldn't let their child achieve that goal weather it may be the student not having transportation, they may not have certain materials they need for that task, plus many more reasons. But with every disadvantage comes an advantage.

There are many advantages when it comes to assigning a task that will help the environment. First of all, if the student actually does the assignment, then it will help the environment. Even if it is just one little thing. Many little things can lead to one great thing. And every now and then, you will find some students that will go out of their way to help change our declining environment. And those students usually have parents that will support them with the supplies and transportation the students desire.

I personally think that the environmental project would be a great way to help our environment. And it would be a great way to boost up my grades! But if you do decide to make the project go in effect, then i would appreciate if we could work in a group of two or three classmates. Like i said, I'm all for the project because i know my parents, and if i worked in a group, their parents, would support us, the future of this nation we call home, in participating in this great move to help change the future of this planet.

I remember when I was a little girl my dad would take me to go the park every Sunday to pick up litter. He would always tell me ""It's very important to help out your community.""

Now he works on the weekends but, I still go every Sunday. There are so many reasons to do community service. It help the community you live in, it can teach you new things, also it shows you what things are really important.

It helps your community more then people realize. The little actions can influence other people and eventually become bigger actions. It also helps our planet, by picking up litter your helping to stop and animal from chocking on it. Also if you help paint a neighborhood and clean it up then the people will be happier too. With happier people just makes it a better place to live in.

It can teach you new things. You could learn how to make things out of recycled cans, paper, anything. It will teach you that community service helps everybody rather then just yourself. Nobody just does it and never learns anything or nobody would ever do it. It can teach you how to make other people happy and make things better for everybody.

Community service shows you some things that are actually important in life. Rather then the new shows on T.V. Nobody likes to live in a dirty place so it can show you how to keep things clean. You could start a tradition like my dad did with me, you could do it with a family member or friends. It shows you how to put other people before yourself and how to make others happy. You will learn new things every time you go.

All in all community service is a great way to show people many things. They could help their community, learn new things, or even find out what's really important in life. Without community service the parks would be discussing, there would probably be more wrecked neighborhoods which nobody wants to live in, life wouldn't be as beautiful. Community service isn't hard to do, it just takes a little effort. So Principal you see why it is so very important to have community service mandatory in schools. Life would change without it.",4,Community service,Independent

I don't think you should make students do community service in they don't want to. Doing community service should be their choice. What they want to do on their own time should be their decision. They al ready go to school 7hours a day, let them do what they want when they get home. I am sure that kids wouldn't do as much homework if they had to do community service. Kids are al ready so busy, they have a social life, most teens have jobs, they have tons of school work to complete and a lot of kids are on sports teams. Adding one more thing would make them stressed and they might not get as good of grades or they might neglect something they have to do like homework.

If you are thinking of making them do it on school time then that would be a waste of time. I know that helping the community is important and all and I would diffidently encourage it in schools but, forcing them to do it is wrong there are more important things to do than community service. Getting good grades is definitely one of them, that is pretty mush the most important thing in your life as a teenager. Getting good grades pretty much decides the rest of your life because if you don't get good grades then you will not get into a very good college and you will probably not end up with a job you like.

Adding on more thing to their lives' is going to probably get into the way of school work and sports or other activities. Sports are important to for a kid. Sports helps you stay healthy and it can relive some stress. Look at most Americans a lot of them are fat. If kids don't get exercise then they will be unhealthy and probably develop bad eating habits. This community service thing is most likely going to get in the way of their exercise and sports which will lead to them being unhealthy and fat. So please don't force kids to do community service.

Imagine if a student has the best grades and is the most outgoing and logical student. She has just got excepted to Harvard Law school program but is unable to go because she has no community service records. Community service is very important because you are supposed to give back to your community and help out once in a while. Also it is the right thing to do because you feel good about yourself after it's over. I think all kids no matter what their grades are should perform community service because it is important for our futures. Kids have way to much free time, kids get in trouble when there not watched and its great for collage.

It is very important that kids perform community service because kids have way to much free time. Yeah there is your athletes who play five different sports but test have proven that two out of ten kids play sports. The other eight sit around and do nothing. The problem with doing nothing in this society is that kids have way to much access. Most kids have had facebook since sixth grade and get in a lot of trouble for it. Other kids sit home all day and play up to thirty hours worth of video games in one week. That is crazy because x-box and wii are not teaching you anything about the real world. Community service shows you have important it is to give back to people who have less then you do. Studies show that the worst thing that kids do after school is watch television. Most kids watch up to sixty hours worth of television each week. I highly doubt the Kardashians and Jersey Shore are teaching us the importance of helping our community.

Also kids get in trouble that is a natural thing in life kids get in trouble for fighting and cheating, but never smoking. Smoking for middle school's have gone up 20% since last year. Kids feel like they have nothing better to do in their lives so they just try a cigarette or even worse marijuana. But if kids donated more and helped out their community the number would go down dramatically from last year. Also, we are kids we make mistakes but so we don't make the same mistakes as the homeless people we need to learn how hard it is the make a living an do work, and this will teach us. I got in trouble last year for cheating on a test and instead of yelling at my mom took me to the homeless shelter and showed me how I was going to end up if I cheat and don't learn the information. I swore from that moment on that I would never cheat again, and I haven't. My mom scared me into studying and that is exactly what these kids need.

Lastly, community service looks great on a collage recommendation. My cousin didn't get into Princeton, Harvard or Yale because she didn't have a collage recommendation because community service wasn't required in her school. I know in our grade about 30% of kids aren't going to collage because they don't feel like they earned it and they don't feel good enough. That number can go down only if community service is required. Community service is not just helping clean up garbage or helping out in a soup kitchen, it could change someone's life. One of us could change a life forever but that is only if you agree to make community service mandatory in this school. I understand that kids are busy playing sports and in other activities. But that doesn't mean kids can't take one Saturday a month to help the community. I ask you TEACHER_NAME what do you think is the right choice to make?

I believe that all kids should have to do community service. There are a few reasons why i believe that they all should have to. If you want to be part of a friendly community you should take part in your city. Also if you have to do community service it could be just little things like helping a teacher after school. It doesn't have to be a huge job that you can not handle. I know some kids might be upset with this but I think that it is right that everyone has to take part in their community. I don't think it should be hard to find a way to help out in your community.

You could do a lot of jobs in your community.

If you don't have the time to do this community service I think you should talk to your teacher about how you could earn your community service during school hours. Some jobs you could do in your community are that you can help out at a fundraising event. Also you could try to help tutor a person in your class or even a younger sibling or even someone in your neighborhood. You could help out at like a school activity for a younger sibling so you could get fun out of what you did. There are so many other things people could do for community service.

I could go on and on about jobs they can do but I just want to get the point across that kids are not part of their community anymore like they us to be. I know a lot of people might have different opinions but I think it is just a good deed you put it for the day. I don't think it should be hard to find a way to help out in your community. I believe that each and every student in our school should have to put forward a few hours of community service. Thanks for you time.

Community service is a great thing to do for the environment. This assignment for others to do community service will help out our community alot thanks to your gratitude. I know for a fact that once every student does community service that our community will be showing a great example for other students at other schools. This will help others relize how important the environment is these days and how bad it is now. Students will begin to relize that life isn't all about games and electronic devices. Its about the hard work in life that gets your through the bad and good. And that you need to show respect for the environment and others around you.

People will start beginning to show an bit more patients in life once they know that the community is a safe and healthy place. Wouldn't you want to people to clean up after themselves. Instead of you doing it for them. People have been littering for years and it is now time for people to take responsibility for there actions. We need to show them that doing a little work for the community can make a big difference in our world that we live in today. It is time for people to fix there mistakes and admit what they have done wrong.

I hope that you consider my letter as a letter of hope and a chance for something new. So do what is right and allow people to relize that when you do something for the community it will do something back for you. Which would be a nice, free, cleansed world that is safe for others to live in and you no longer have to worry about the safety of the environment.

Yes, community service is important for kids to take part in. Although, I do not think it is fair for all children to be required to perform community service without a choice. First of all, some students take part in many things and barely have any time to finish what they need to do already. Many students have extra curricular activities they take part in which barely leave them time to finish their homework. Some students hardly even get time to themselves or to hang out with their friends and just be a kid! If you add on community service work to their already too busy lives, they will start over booking their time and become completely worn out. This could even lead to bad grades in school! Not to mention how much stress this could put on a student which is very unhealthy for a child and could even lead to them having anxiety attacks! Students should not be required to perform community service.

In addition, it is unfair to force students to do things they do not want to do, especially if it has to do with physical work such us picking up litter, etc. They should have a choice whether or not they want to do this, and maybe to make it more fair extra credit could be offered to children that decide to perform community service. This will let the kids that want to help the community be rewarded for their extra hard work. In conclusion, I feel that it should not be required for students to take part in community service and that they should have a choice of whether or not they want to take part in it.",4,Community service,Independent

You may think that all students need to perform community service ,but in reality they don't have to if they don't want to. Some students choose not to do community service because they want to do it others probably have things to or they just don't want to do them. You can not make students perform community service hours if they don't want to it is against the law and it's against school policy to make them do something they don't want to do. As me coming from the bottom of my heart you should not force students to do community service hours if they don't want to and if they do fine let them go ahead and do it .You cant make them perform something that they will not be pleased to do unless there parents make them do community service hours, but all in all you can not force students to do community service hours. If you want students to do community service hours you should have a meeting to see how they feel about it and you should tell them how you think it will benefit them because if not its just a waste of time for you trying to get children to do community service hours especially if they already have things to do after school or if they have some type of job awaiting. As a student myself I highly don't think it is fair for you to make kids perform community service hours while there under the impression that it will better help them when in reality you just want them to do it just to do it. Some people already help the community some already clean up the liter so by forcing them to do more community service they are just going to say forget it and that I'm done with this. By forcing students to do community service hours they are going to lose respect for you and they will just blow you off once you ask them to do something or if you ask them to give you something. You should not force students to community service hours if they don't want to at all its just wrong and its mean to force them into something they wouldn't want to do.

206F0D958641,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, my piers and I have heard about what you are trying to do to our students, i highly disagree with you forcing us to do community service, i hope you take the time to read some of these suggestions.

Most students would consider community service a punishment, a very brutal punishment. You cant require students to do community service for no reason, although for a punishment for something a student has done wrong i highly agree, depending on the strength of the crime. Although your asking for all students to perform community service routinely, my main issue with your idea is that if you did make us do this, it would have to be outside of school hours, or cutting major time into our lunch/recess.

If possible, you could cut 5 minutes into each class, that would acquire 30 minutes for community service, depending on the schedule each group of students can do a different job, such as cleaning the cafeteria, hallways, courtyard and emptying the garbage/recycling bins. The concern is that you want us students to take time out of our day, when we did nothing wrong, as stated in the this paragraph you can take time out of classes, but its almost a guarantee that you wouldn't even 2nd guess that, and the students opinion.

I want you to think about how you would feel after a long day of school, 6 hours of straight learning with no breaks or free time, having to spend an hour along the highway cleaning up road kill and fast food rappers all across the ground, in the hot sun. Reading and teaching elementary school children shouldn't even be thought of, why would we drive all the way to their school in our free time to help 6th graders with their math when they can hire a tutor, or stay after class and get some extra help, sure if they are willing to come to us during school hours, otherwise i highly doubt that anyone will do your amazing plan of community service.

If a student is caught smoking illegal substances, or perhaps vandalizing, fighting, bullying/harassment, then sure, go for it, but your trying to force innocent well behaved students into doing your dirty work, cleaning up random trash across the hallways when its the custodians job. Depending on the crime entitled i think the punishment should vary, physical fighting, 2 hours of community service, smoking illegal substances, 5 hours of community service, vandalizing, 7 hours of community service, and bullying 1 hour of community service.

Why should you listen to a 14 year old telling you how to do your job? Maybe because he's speaking for the whole school, and all of us don't think its fair that you would just consider this without consulting any of us, taking a vote, or even trying to reason, i hope you get time to read this, and at least consider some changes in your plan.",5,Community service,Independent
DECE6EE13BDB,"Dear Principle,

I want to bring your attention to making students do community service. community service will teach the students how to be responsible, because they will have to be responsible for doing their community service, it will keep them out of trouble, because they have something else to do besides go to friends houses, and party, and they have something them, and their family can be proud of because they made their own decision to help the community.

Certainly,

If you decide to make the students do community service, they will become more responsible. For example, the students will have to be on time to their community service job and that will help them to be on time to other things in life. They will also have to be responsible and make sure they help the community, and not forget to do their job, which is like a normal kid doing homework in school. The student has to do their home work, and they can not forget. I think that community service will help them to also be more independent, because they have to do their own duty of something like picking up trash on school property, and they will not be able to have help because it is their own job. At home I am responsible for taking out the trash. That is my responsibility, even though it is the family trash. I take out the trash whenever it needs to be taken out, and I do not even get paid, just like a community service job. I do not always want to take out the trash but with community service, it shows me how if I am responsible I am not only helping myself, but the environment, and the people around me.

Community service will also keep children out of trouble. Some students these days go to party's, and get grounded for several reasons. However, with community service the students will have something to do on their spare time which will lead to not getting in trouble, or being somewhere there not supposed to be. The students will have to be do the community service, but instead of being somewhere their parents can not contact them, they will be building a garden for a school, or helping little kids learn to read, Doesn't that sound better to you? If the students are feeling stressed out they know that they can attend to their community service job instead of doing something bad just to get the stress away. Of course the students could do a community service job with their friends, but the point is that they will be safe and doing something good for the community.

Have you ever wanted to be the only subject at the diner table? The one your parents want to brag about to their friends? Well, I know I do. If you make the students do community service, their family would be so proud of them for stepping up and helping out. Maybe some kids do not do sports, so their parents do not have something to cheer at every weekend, but If a student came home to their family telling them how good they felt about doing community service that weekend, then the parents have something very special to cheer for. Parents of students want their children to do good in school, and if you consider making community service part of your school , then I am sure that you will be getting calls from parents saying thank-you for making my children do community service I am so proud and it has helped them so much. I know that if I helped out the community not only my parents would be proud, but I would be more than proud of myself.

Keep in mind that Some of my friends have already started doing community service on their own, like tutoring elementary school children, and picking up liter on the streets, they told me that it has helped them so much,a nd I would like to be li Therefore, if you could get everyone in the school to do that then Don't forget it would make everyone have so much more responsibility, as well as they would stay out of trouble, and their family and them would be so proud.

I think that it will change student is the most spectacular way, and I hope that you agree as well.

Community service tasks are a good way to get students involved. It would help get more things done in the community. Instead of forcing students to do things they don't like, they could help with something they are interested in. The students might find something they like or are really good at. It might also keep they off the couch and away from the TV and computer. I think that community service hours are a good idea for the students to work on.

If you love to read or having time to think in a quiet environment you could help in the library. You could shelf books, dust, or just help people find what they need. If you don't think the library would be a good place for you, you could find other places to volunteer such as an animal shelter, a hospital, a soup kitchen, or you could just coach a little league sports team. There's always a place looking for extra help. You may not get payed, but you'll feel good about yourself for helping people and animals who need it.

There are also charity events you can take part in. The 'Race for the Cure' is a charity that raises money for people with breast cancer and can't pay their medical bills. You don't have to race or even walk, you could just donate money. You can get a special t-shirt and a pamphlet for participating. You can invite all your friends to walk to!

Students need to get out in the world and help people who need it. It will help prepare you for the future when you get a job. Community service also looks good on a college application. Many people see that as a good quality in a person. It might also be a fun experience you will remember forever.

To sum things up, I think community service hours are a good idea. You may not like it at first, but it's good to try new things. There are many examples as to why community service would be a good thing to have students do. It would make students think twice about their careers. I hope this has persuaded you to think more about community service hours.      ",3,Community service,Independent

How are you doing today? I would like to give you my opinion on kids doing community service. I think it is a good idea for kids to do community service despite what they want to do. Community service shows discipline, dedication, and leadership. Today I will be explaining why I think community service should be required for all students. Please sit back, relax, and read along.

The first reason why I think students should be required to do community is because it teaches discipline. It teaches discipline because it keeps you focus and not letting you get caught up. For example, there is so many negative things going on these days, and if you are doing something good with your time, you don't have time for the negativity. It also shows discipline because community service is something that you have to do consisting, so community service is something that you have to do, and be dedicated to doing it. This is my first reason why I think all students should be required to do community service.

Next, community service teaches students how to be a good citizen. By doing community service for along time, eventually students will start picking up trash, helping people, and things like that when their not doing community service. They do those things because that is just the person they have become from doing community service. Community service teaches a lot of good things and how to be good citizen is one of them. Citizenship is a great quality to have.

Lastly, community service shows leadership. It shows leadership because some of the students friends might not be doing it, but for a student to still do it, that is showing leadership. Also because in your neighborhood your being a leader by, picking up trash, helping      ",3,Community service,Independent
C7B95C4C7D3F,"Dear TEACHER_NAME

I don't think that making everyone do community service would be a good idea.

Not all of the students have time to, some have to care for siblings, some have to work, and others don't even live nearby. It doesn't seem fair to these people. Some will be able to, but not all have the time or money to do this. If you do this during school you cut valuable skills out of their education.

Some would just be to lazy to do it, others travel a lot which also doesn't allow them perform community service. Although some would love this others would hate it. some have family members in the hospital, by making them do community service you cut out time to spend with their families. What about people with diseases? They could get sick, or possibly be killed by something they touch, or inhale. Some may have family members that have died, and need to go to their funeral.

I myself have no diseases, no sick family members, and I don't travel a lot but I have to watch my little brother, and make sure my older brother does his treatments for Cystic Fibrosis, a disease that affects lung function. I can't do it because of these factors, others may have these factors and more. By taking time out of classes you would not be doing your job of giving us an education, so that we can learn the skills needed to succeed in life. Those with certain diseases can die by one mistake, touching something they're allergic to added to the effects of their diseases which could lower their lung function for example, could you live with knowing you may have caused someone to die?

Just think about these, would it be fair to have someone whose in poverty have to spend money to help the community when they barely have enough for themselves? Is it fair for the child whose mom, or dad, is laying on her, or his, death bed to be unable to see her, or him? Is it fair for the child with a disease is going to kill him to have to quit spending time with his, or her family?

I know you want all the student to help our community, but i believe that the students hear have to much work on their hands right now. Our finals are in a week and we need all the time we can get to study. Yes, I think helping the community is an amazing idea. But on the other hand, don't you think students will love to go to college some day? Think about it, if we spend time tutoring children and cleaning up litter when are the students going to be able to study? Time is valuable! We can't just waste it. We help the community when we get older and get a job. For example, a doctor helps injured people and the president of the United States helps our nation to be safer more educational place for the people. We can't become a doctor, police officer, or president of the United States without going to college and getting our degree! In the future, when we are responsible adults, it would be best to help out our community. Right now we are young and we need the time we have to grow up and get a great education to become a responsible adult. Even if you still make us do community service the student will not do as they are told. Sadly, it's the truth. Most of the students hear are more committed to do great in school then go pick up garbage from the street. As you can see, the students can't be forced to help our community.

I think that all students should not be required to perform community service. Because what if a student always has a lot of home work to do after school but has little time to do it so he or she would want a study hall during school so that they can finish their work in school, but if they have community service they would probably have little to no time to do their work so they would rush threw it and do poorly on the assignment.

In other cases some student's might want to get home relax and just do stuff with their friends instead of working almost all day, but they can't because they would have community service. It's not bad it should just be optional for the people who want to do it and for the people who want to do it.

So that is why I do not support the idea of having community service for students t do.",2,Community service,Independent
6225570285BC,"To me students should be required to do community service. It would be good for some people to learn the work ethic so they can use it later in life. The most important reason students should be required to do that is that they might be trouble makers. Trouble makers need to learn to do something good for their life. Some bad people have to community service to make them learn. Some people might not learn and keep doing what they were doing before like getting in trouble. If there was a perfect student that has good grades and doesn't get in trouble I still think that they should do community service. If they know how to work then they'll probably use that knowledge and go to college and might do some good for the community. I'm not just saying students should do it. Take some time to think for all adults to do it. Some adults may have not learned a good work ethic as a kid, but they can learn it as an adult. Tutoring is a very good thing to do. Some kids might not be as fast as a learner than you are. You can try to get that child to be on the same level as you. I just think that a couple of elementary kids should be tutored. I say that, because if you have every single older kid teaching little kids the little kid wouldn't learn a thing just by having someone helping them with their homework. You could also shovel snow in the winter for you community. For example, when I'm watching the news it shows that a major amount of elderly people have heart attacks, because of shoveling snow. Every little thing that you do can help a majority of your community. Sports is a great example of community service. I see NFL football players on TV about NFL play 60. They are helping kids 15-20 years younger than them. Also in the instructions it says that some kids say it takes up time. I think that it is well worth their time. You can easily make a good reputation of yourself for helping some people. I'm not saying to use up all your free time to help people. If your outside riding bikes with your friends or something and you see a person drop garbage or something, you can easily pick it up and throw it away for them. Like I said small actions can turn into big good or bad things. Community service does not just mean helping out your neighborhood it also means helping out your town or city. To me some people that you work with might go around town to people and tell them about you, and they will probably respect you. There are so many pro and cons about this. Right now I'm just thinking about the cons. There are probably less cons than there is pros. I'll tell you that on con about this is that people would think that you are a suck up to your town.

0F19DD8FEEDC,"Dear, principal, i will like to star in saying that i think it would be good for us student to help the environment because that way there is not to much contamination on the community and it would be healthy and safe to the people that lives in the community. Us student can also do good thinks when we are doing the community service because that way un winter we can go and shovel some snow and on summer we could do other things. and doing community service its not only going outside or doing hard work you can also help some church , hospitals ,in a store and also in helping teachers and other things like babysitting. Doing community service it could also be fun it doesn't have to always be boring it could be fun because if they send you to places that you have to be with a lot of people you could be with your friend when you are doing community service like helping a teacher the teacher might need to helpers so you can ask your friend if he/she wants to go with you so you could not be by your self. community service it is also good because the way you are not always in your house trying to figure out what are you going to do because your bored or you will not be just laying down in the bed or in the sofa playing video games or watching a movie because over time that will get boring for you and it will affect your healthy so that's why its good to do community service even ones a week or in a month its not bad to do community service I do community service all Sundays and sometimes over the weekend it is so fun to do community service because i spend some times with my friends with out going to the mall or anything like that so it will be good for other student to do some community services so they can see that it is not boring to do them. so i will like to tell you principal that you should put students to do community services so they could see how good and fun it is . i will like to say that is fun to do because sometimes you are like what should i do today or what i am going to do tomorrow and you get so stress that you don't even know what to do so sometimes when you are like that and you have to do community service it would not be that hard for you to stress. you can also help your mom doing something it would be good for her to you be helping here to your dad to because sometimes your dad its tired of working and he will ask your help so you could help him and that will also can be community service because your helping your parents so that's why i thing you should put student to do the community service.

I think that the students SHOULD perform community service because it would be helping out with our community. We should go around and start to pick up trash and through it away not because we HAVE to but because it would HELP OUR COMMUNITY! Besides if we don't pick up trash and garbage off the ground and out of the water than animals could die and it would most likely be OUR fault because we wouldn't have done nothing about it.

We could also do something to try and reduce the use of pollution by riding bikes roller blades and roller blades, and using skate boards and also many more things other than using cars all of the time and creating more pollution because our world does not need to be exposed to that particular substance. As long as the world is being taken care of please try and make anything that can help our community even more possible so that less animals can die and that more will survive. If there is anything you can do to make this world a better place then you can start by letting us help out this world. Lets go planet green!

B731FAF1A933,If you clean up trash on the side of the road then that is helping the community. If you are walking to a building and you see trash the pick it up because we want to save our community. If i was walking down the sidewalk and very important building then i would pick up the trash on the side of the road. If i see someone throw there trash out the i will pick it up because i don't want to lose our community. I don't like it when people put there trash on the floor because if it is your trash then you pick it up. In the lunch room the other day there was trash on the table so i picked it up because the teacher said if you don't pick your trash up then the whole class will have silent lunch then you wont get to talk to your friends. I don't like to liter and i don't like it when people liter. I like it when people do not liter and when i don't liter. I think that kids should go around and pick up trash around the school and see how easy it is to pick up the trash in our community. It would not hurt them to pick up trash once in there life time.,1,Community service,Independent

Students should not be required to perform community service. Students should not have to do community service because it is the students time and it should be up to them on how they should use it. The students would be unhappy with this decision and maybe some parents would too. This would cause the school to have unpleasant school days, knowing they will have to do community service when they get home. some families may even move out of the school district because of this. Requiring students to do community service also goes against human rights, nobody is able to make them do community service. It is not justified to make them do community service because you think they should and you are the principle. People will be unhappy with your decision if you go through with this. Students should not be required to do community service because it will be a conflict with their extracurricular and sports activities. Athletes will have to cut practices short because they have to do community service, thus for not allowing them to become better at their sport. if you make the students do community service I am sure many people will be unhappy.

I think community service is great it helps make our town, schools and community look good.

If a student or person does something wrong then they should have to do community service to show them what they did is wrong but if people want to do community service just cause they want to help our town/city or schools/businesses. if someone likes to work with kids then they could help by tutoring or by helping a person watch there kids for no cost or charge. If a person likes animals then they could volunteer at the local animal shelter. There are so many things to do for community service there ; picking up trash at a populated place, painting over graffiti, and a lot more stuff for community service.

so i think that community service should be voluntary or mandatory for people who have do something wrong that cant be fixed or forgotten.

Everyone should have there own opinion on the way they feel about having to do something that they don't want to do or if they want to do community service.

F98C913B5446,"dear, principle performing community service is a good idea but you also need time to study. Does this mean that we will get out of class or will we do community service after school is out? The problem with getting out of class is that we need as much time as we possibly can have to learn. For instance if we end up skipping class to help with community service then we will end up falling behind and going to school latter into our summer break. We could also end up failing because of not learning enough or studying too little. If we help with community service out of school then we would be able to help more, the only thing is that if we have homework then we would have to choose between homework and community service. Most would probably choose not doing their homework . Then when we would go to turn in our homework the students grade would go down and they could fail.

Therefore I think we should not participate in community service unless its on our own time.

88FC05DDCC92,"Dear Principal,

I realize some people may think that community service is a waste of time, a distraction from work or friends and family, but I can assure you that community service is greatly needed. It doesn't matter that it may take time away from work or other jobs, we all need to give back now and then. We ,as a community, cant have a ""well-someone-else-should-do-it"" attitude, because if we all thought that then nothing would ever get done. In these times, when some people are working two jobs just to feed their family, and we have so much extra, it would be selfish and greedy of us not to give back.

Community service doesn't have to be boring either, there are lots of fun ways to give back to our community. For example, you could go to a animal shelter and help walk and feed the animals. Or you could go to a nursing home and play games with the seniors there. I'm sure they would also love to have someone sit and just listen to them tell a story or two. There are lots of fun ways to help out that don't include getting dirty or being outside.

But if someone felt like they wanted to do more laborious work then there are other jobs they can do as well. They could help clean up garbage at a beach. They could help redo a local park by putting in bark dust or planting trees. Also, they could find a nice local garden or farm that had some jobs that needed to be done. There could be non-profit organizations that need some volunteers with events or charities as well.

But it doesn't matter whether you are outside or inside as long as you are trying your best to help out. I think that if you didn't have the students at our school do community service you would be doing them a great injustice. When we are so privileged to have a nice home, clean water, and a meal on the table every night we should at least be able to go out for an our or two and help someone else who isn't as privileged. Its hardly a great burden to get up from the computer or desk you are at, put on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and go out and help. So I ask only one thing of you; please set aside one day, one measly day, to have all of the students in our school wander out into the community and help someone. Thank you and I hope you take my letter into consideration while you make your decision.

2F5A100EB508,"Dear principal, there has been arguments about everyone in the school performing community service. I think that everyone should have a choice if they want to do community service. I think that community service should be for extra credit because other people don't want to do community service.

In my opinion i think that community service is needed because it really helps are community in many ways such as cleaning up the trash. It is important because it helps clean our environment. Also that the community doesn't need to hire workers to do it, so the community gets to say money. Another example is tutoring elementary children. This helps because some kids are in need of helps, and as I said teachers and parents don't need to pay for the tutor.

I think people who don't want to do community service think it's too much work. I don't think its a lot of work because you get to help out the community. Also I think that when people say community service, people think that its only just picking up trash, and they think its dirty, but community service isn't just picking up trash its about tutoring other children, and helping at the park.

I think that the principal should not require all students to do community service. When i hear someone say i am going to help out by signing up for community service I think of them doing it on their own and not being made to do it.

Some children do not have time on their hands to help out. There are a lot of people who do a lot of things and have a things written down for the week and may not be able to add another thing to the week. If parents of the children have them in sports that take up most of their afternoon time and they also have school in the morning then kids grades might start to drop because they may not be able to prioritise things they way their parents want them to verses the way the principal wants them too.

Community service is a great idea for the people who have time on their hands and would like to do something to help out. Community service is a great idea and I think its great when people do something to help the community, but leave the helping out to the people who want to do it not for everyone to be obligated to do it because the principal says you need to do a certain amount of community service before the year is over.

What should be done is the principal should do is make kids who do bad things in school or kids who let their grades drop below a ""C"" do community service. They will work till she or he feels they worked enough to make up for what they did wrong or get their grade back above a ""C"". If I child knows that if they have to do something called work if they do something bad then I think some of them would start putting 2 and 2 together if they had to do manually labor for 5 hours over the weekend. That would be better then suspending them and not making them do anything but miss school for what they did wrong, and they will learn nothing but realize they get to get out of school for something they did wrong. A kid will start to pay more attention in class and start turning their homework in if they have to do work for anything lower than a ""C"". But to make someone who either doesn't have time or doesn't want to do community service be forced to is not the was of the United stars. The United states gives the people the right of speech and the right to do what they would like to do, with boundaries.

If the principal ends up passing this as a rule then the name of ""Community service"" would need to be changed to something different. When someone does community service it is something they sign up for or something they do when they do something wrong to work off what they did. A lot of people I know would like to help out and do some sort of community service but a lot of the time they don't have time to make a commitment to it. Sports could get in the way or school and keeping grades up. Let the people who have time to help and want to help do community services.

Some student like doing community services for there community and some students think its a waste of time i' m going to try to persuade you to encourage all students to at least 100 community hours .

Student should be encouraged to take community hours because instead of them going home and just start watching t. v or play video games like 95% of the students do when they home and do that for the rest of day they can be out helping the community they can go to a school and tutor kids or go help clean up the local park or at least help with something.

Another reason why students should be encouraged to participate in community services because instead of the 10% out students out there are doing drugs and ruining the community they can be helping it by help clean up the litter they find in the street and to help stop polluting the water sources they have and try to get a petition to get a car pool lane on the highway to help stop air pollution.

My 3rd & final reason that student should be encourage to do community service hours because they may think that because you help the community you might get a reward of money or something that wont matter because the most best important reward that you know you helped your community become a better place to learn , keep safe and live.

A lot of the kids kept asking why do they have to do community service and if they were getting paid for it . We all explained to them that community service will not always be fun and you do need to get paid for helping your community , it's just something that people in your community needs help with . We also discussed having kids who behave and get good grades to get to pick and choose witch days that they want to do community service and if they want to compete against other people to get money for doing there jobs . We choose to have 4 different groups to go into a challenge of doing the best community service .

The topic of community service has come up lately for students. Weather that students should be required to do community service or not. My opinion for this matter is that community service should be required but not that much of it.

One reason I think that we should have students help our community is that our world is falling apart when it comes to pollution and such. Everyday we see trash, cigarettes, and dirty roads. As a student i think that we especially need to reach out to other students because if we don't change it then who will? A pastor once said ""If not now then when, if not you then who?""

Another reason is that we have people that are not fortunate enough to had the thing like we have. Like food, clothes, shelter, I think that our school should reach out to those in need by providing food to the homeless or giving the homeless warm clothes for the winter. There are many ways we can reach out to those in need.

With these reasons there are problems unfortunately. Students have activity's and hobbies after school so this service has to be taken during school. We could perform this generous work during recess at school. It will not kill students to miss one or two days of recess. This way you can make sure that all of the students have had there certain amount of community service.

This is a big subject to displace if you do not decide to get your school involved into this service. I'm sure you wouldn't want your child growing up in a dirty world or sitting their and watching people die from starvation. I hope you take this letter into consideration.

I think that it should be required for students to do community service but the hours they are required to do should be little/small. I think that the required hours should be little because some people don't want to do it so therefore everyone gets a little if what they want.

I think that community service should be required because first of all, it helps out the community in many ways. It gives people help that they need and deserve. It also gives the students a good feeling that they helped out someone in need. And if you are lucky, the student could like doing community service and do it over the summer or other vacations. Second of all, the students don't get paid so it saves the town money, money that should be spent on more important things. Some people or store owners don't have a lot of money to spend but need the extra help. It also helps the kids get into college. If they put that they did and x amount of hours doing community service onto he/she's application, then the college that he/she is applying to while obviously see that as a good thing.

I think that there should a small/little amount of hours is because the students that don't want to do community service said that there is then not enough time to do things they like or more important things. In order to appeal to that group, the small amount of hours would let them do the things they said that they couldn't do. Since it takes time away from the student doing homework, playing sports, seeing friends and family, the small amount of hours required would let them do those things and let them do community service.

I think you should require community service for at least half off the school year. Some kids can't afford a tutor so why cant the older teens take hold of the that problem , we have already learned this stuff so why can't you teach it too. It is our responsibility to become the leaders of this nation when our time comes why can't we start young. There is many different things you could do such as volunteer at the local soup kitchen, got to the local homeless shelter and help out there, you just help out in your neighborhood. I think that this should be apart of your final grade. There are some many people out there that needs our help. You can raise money for a family in need because we know the economy is down and here in Michigan there aren't a lot of jobs I know how it feels to go with out but we need to stand up and take hold of this problem. A lot people may only need someone to talk to and if that's what they need then be there for that person. When I see a homeless person in the streets, i seat there and wonder why our community has not done anything. We need to step up and take matter in our own hand. I don't like to see people in pain or hurt or anything. But when other people put that person hurts someone else it makes me madder. Why cant we just suck it up and help other and treat that person with respect not just to get it done. We should be so happy when that person is happy because of what you have done.

My Name is STUDENT_NAME and I'm a student here. I think community service should be required for many reasons. First I have 120 Hours of community service over my one and a half years at SCHOOL_NAME and they weren't that hard to get. Second it makes you a better person by just one act of kindness. Third it a chance for students to help out in there community.

First there is a class here called community service and leadership in that class you are required to do at least 10 hours of community service. I took the class and ended up doing really well so now I'm one of 16 kids in our school who are junior advisers. It's kind of like a student council. I went above and beyond 10 and got 48 by the end of the school year last year. I found it kind of fun to be honest. Now since then I have gotten 72 hours. I Think that every kid should try for ten.

Second it makes you feel good one time I escorted senior citizens to there seats in a theater then took there walkers. Then at the end of the show I brought all the walkers back and gave them to each person. When I got home I felt good for such a simple thing and I think students don't realize how much it does for yourself.

Finally its a chance to see what kind of things are going on in the community and to get involved. One time I volunteered at a ware house where they put together luminaries in kits. Before then a bag would just be on my door step in mid December with stuff to make luminaries, I never really thought where they came from or who put them together.

I feel like all students should participate in community service. Community service is a way of giving back to your community. In today's world we sometimes take are community for granted and don't really see how important it should be for us. Community service also shows something you can be proud of. We can give back to our community just by doing small things we are making a big impact in our community. In a way community service is like saying thank you to our community, for allowing us to be part of it and having an education that nobody could take away from us. Community service is a learning experience that we should all experience for at least once. Just by letting us do community service you are opening the door to new things we can try. Maybe we can take community service to the next level and start doing things for this country. Community service is the first step to helping people around you. Community service may take sometime of what we want to do, but then you come to realize that it wasn't, probably not as important as helping your community. community service also helps you care for your environment and find the negatives and positives of it and try to change them for the best.

There are many things that can benefit from community service, there are also many things that can not be beneficial. One of the things that can benefit from community service is responsibility. The reason i choose this as a beneficial reasoning is because many kids need respect now days. Another reason would be to learn how to handle things outside home and school, but also learn how to handle things at home and in school. There are also bad things that aren't beneficial from community service. This is because some kids need time to focus on school priorities as well. For example, say you had an essay paper to do but you had to do community service but you don't finish later. By then you would have forgotten about the paper and you would have also been tired. so there is no good outcome from community service as much as there is a beneficial outcome.

As our principal, you of all people should understand that while community service is an excellent thing to do for our school, we have other things that can leave us with very little time to do community service throughout the school year. After school activities or clubs, sports, and homework given to us can make us unwilling to participate in mandatory community service.

I do think some community service is always a good thing, but a large mandatory amount may teach students to disrelish the idea of community service. On the other hand, I do see helping the community as an important issue. I am partially in agreement for both suggestions, but I believe a medium can be found. Perhaps we can pick a day in school where we can go on a field trip of sorts, to do community service.

Community service projects such as tutoring could also perhaps be offered as extra credit, to prove that the student is knowledgeable enough of the topic in question to teach it to a younger or equally aged person about it. Community service might also be able to be chosen as an elective to go on a record for high school or college, showing that the particular student has an interest in helping the community.

In summarization, I believe that students should not be forced to perform community service. I do believe, however, that benefits should be provided to those that do. This would give many kids a contrivance and a reason to performing community service, such as something to put on an application, or extra credit points, even a diminutive amount could aid a student.

I think we should not be required to do community service if we do not want to. Making someone do community service is wrong. I think that if we want to help out and do community service it should be our choose know one else's. Community service is a nice thing to do for our earth ,but making someone do it is not right. People should want to help our planet out because they feel like helping not because someone telling them what to do. Making the planet a better place to live on is a good idea. More people should try to help out there community. If someone was telling me what to do i know i wouldn't do it. No teenager or anyone is going to be happy about someone else trying to boss them around i know i don't like being told what to do. Most teenager , if you tell them no they go ahead and do it anyways because know one wants to be told what to do. Plus its enough problems with our parents bossing us around now we have our principal doing it. which really doesn't fit me so well. I think everyone should get involved with working hard to keep our world safe and clean. So if just a little amount of help would do something. Even if you cleaned around your house would help. Doing dishes would even help. For you are principal to ask so much out of us kids is wrong. I mean its bad enough we have to keep our grades up at school ,but now your asking us to do more. Community work does take up a lot of your time of hanging out with friends and doing your homework. You should at least try to help out a little though. If you are hanging out with your friends outside and you see trash on the floor. Why couldn't you just go over to the trash and pick it up it's really not that hard. If your anywhere in the world and you see people littering tell them it's wrong and pick it up. Its not that hard going a couple more minutes and taking trash to the garbage can. I don't think though we should be told what to do. So I think we should at least take a vote on who wants to not be required and who does.

I think that community service is very important and students need to be reminded of that. But its also very time consuming so I believe students should have a choice. You should get parents and community members to sponsor a club for community service. It could be named ASCC or After School Community Cleanup. I personally think the whole problem behind community service with kids is that they believe that it can only be cleaning up litter and such, but we need to remind them that it can also be going to a nursing home or putting on a concert for kids with cancer in the area. Not only would this help out the community but it could be a way to socialize out of school and do work at the same time. Just imagine if the track and field area had no litter at all, if there were multiple trash cans instead of three or four, or even helping make a second loop to pickup children. But see not all children might be able to participate as needed because either they are too little, have a sport, have a doctors appointment or even be allergic to the material your working with. If you do decide to put this club into action Tuesday and Thursday right after school would probably be the most effective and convenient. This is just some of my ideas, so just think about it.

I do think that we should have community service hours required for our school. It is the best moral thing that schools teach and It really should be a requirement.

One reason for this is because students would be giving back to their community. They would be doing something to help the community and make it a better place rather than just playing Xbox or just fooling around.

In addition I think that it is a good idea because the students could actually learn lessons from different tasks they complete and if they do something that hurts the community they can see what it feels like to be the people that have to clean up the aftermath. This is more of a moral understanding than anything else of your community, your friends, and your family and how it affects them.

Finally, I think that kids would have an opportunity to get to know what their community is all about in the first place. If your like me and you pretty only socialize with your group of friends and not with really anybody else, it'll give the person a chance to meet really nice people in your community! Usually, people doing community service are really nice people.

So in conclusion, I think that community service should be a requirement to graduate from school. This conclusion was based off of moral feelings toward the subject.

I think we should do community service because it helps the Earth stay clean. It helps to give back to the community and it's better to then to do nothing. when I hear people say that they don't want to do community service it makes think that they want to live in a town that's dirty and polluted. by doing community service we're keeping are town clean, and not dirty. Most people might have better things to but if they spend at least twenty minutes helping the community they will see the impact that they have to convince other people to help. Some people still might not like it but some will change their mind. When I help someone it makes feel good giving back, that's why I want people to help, so they can feel good giving back.

Some forms of community service is that people clean up litter, clean spray paintings. They're some people that tutor middle school kids, practice sports or other activities. As you can see they're plenty of way to help out the community. I hope you do assign the community service.

I have come to notice that our school might be going to do community service projects. I applaud you in the fact you are showing the littler kids that working for your community is a good thing. But it has also come to my attention that are a few students that would rather not do community service because it takes away from there time to do what they like to do. TEACHER_NAME i have found a way that can fix this problem. I propose that we set a day that students can do community service in school.

For example on every third and fourth Wednesday we could set out forty minutes of class time for community service, like tutoring kids . Kids tutoring other kids is a great community service because it helps the student get better grades and will help the school for Fcat. Another project we can do is a fun day with the students at the local special needs school. We can have a day were about twenty kids are selected by there grade average to go to the school and have a fun day, with a movie and popcorn, and just a day we could hang out together. TEACHER_NAME as you see these are only some community projects we can do, that is also reason to do this in our school because there is so many options the school could use for community service.

Another reason we should have community service is because it can change people. I believe that sometimes doing one good thing, for some one else, can change some one. So if we have community service some of the unruly kids could go to a soup kitchen and see that they don't have it that bad and there is no reason to act this way without a pretty good reason or bring them to a detention center and allow them to talk to the kids, and give a small tutoring lesson since they are out of school for a while, and maybe seeing these kids will allow them to see what there doing and change.

The last most important reason i think we should have community service is that in the future the student will have to have it to graduate so you would be setting them on the path to success.

Thank you and I hope you take this into consideration.

Thank You again.

I do believe all students should be required to do community service. It keeps the community clean and looking better. I don't think however that they should have to do it every day I think it should be twice or maybe three times a week. Because as kids we have lives outside of school so we really don't want to pick up trash every day. I remember one time when I was in fifth grade we had to go outside and pick up the playground because people were making a mess of it. It wasn't really torture but I wasn't bothered by it I mean it was actually kind of enjoyable. If the principle allowed them to do community service during school hours it might not be as big of a conflict. But if you make them come in after school to do community service it might result in a problem. Because there are other things that we would like to do, for example we would rather spend time with our friends or family. I just feel like if you're going to make kids do something at least reason with them a little.

7D537E539C9B,"There are many things that students do after school like play sports or video games. students need to get out in the community by do things that could help.

one of the things that could be done is improving peoples life's like going to soup kitchens and severing food to the people that are less fortunate. one time when i was 10 on Christmas my mother and father took my brother and I to a soup kitchen. when we got there were so many people there that didn't have food that they could give to there family's. one lady hade 5 little boys alone she couldn't get all the boys food that they need so i gave her the food that the soup kitchen was giving me for working there she was very thankful for what she had that it made me think more about helping people. Another time when i went to the homeless shelter was when i was 13 and we were caring food that was donated to give out to the people and this old lady came up to me and asked if she could have some food as we were caring it in and i said yes so we brought her in and gave her some food and she started taking about how she became homeless and it really touched home on what she was saying to me. it made think back to all the times that i have hade it easy and how i took it for granted.

One of the most important things we could do probably is go to special needs places like give Kids The World this organization gives kids that have illnesses that are going to kill them the chance to go to Disney world and do all these things before they are going to die with there family they stay there for a week and have time with them and then they leave. the reason i think this will be a great place to go for kids is because it will make them see how much they will love there life's. another thing to is that they will be working i n places that will teach them how to deal with special needs people. that's some of the reasons why i think that comminute sevice will help kids learn.",3,Community service,Independent
F44018D39BEF,"dear principal, have you ever wondered how nice community service is? well stop wondering and have all of your students do at least 15 minutes of community service a week.

first of all, it is nice to do for others. community service is probably one of the nicest thing you can do for someone. it could help you get stronger. if you help clean up the town, then you could get much more stronger then you were before. if you are stronger then you can do more things that require strength. also, it will build up you self confidence to do more. if you pick up trash around the town then you could get the confidence to do so much more. lastly, it could help you to have a cleaner town. TEACHER_NAME said ""a clan town us a happy town."" also, 90% of towns that are cleaned become some of the most successful towns ever. in conclusion, not only dose community service help you it also helps the town.

little Johnny can relate with the problem of having a dirty town. Little Johnny was walking home from school one day when he noticed a gum rapper on the gray sidewalk, he picked it up and threw it in the garbage can. he continued walking home when he saw another gum rapper on the sidewalk. he picked it up and put it in the garbage. a few minutes later he saw another gum rapper on the sidewalk. but this time he was mad so he ignored it. that afternoon he told his mom and dad about what happened after school, and they said it didn't matter, and that it is not there problem. the next day he was walking home from school when he found another gum rapper on the sidewalk, so he pick it up and brought it home to his mom and dad and the all wrote a letter to the major of his town saying that they should pick up all of the trash on the ground. and they did.

but all is not bad in this situation. there is a way to solve this problem. first of all, you could do exactly what John did and write a letter to the major stating that every body should pick stuff up. also, you could do what i have been trying tell you wah to do for a long time, tell all of your students to do at least 15 minute of community service.

over all, i think that students should do at least 15 minutes of community service a day, so that the town is clean.",3,Community service,Independent

I think students should perform in community service because

I'll show little kids to think of others and not just them self's because when they get older the little kids aren't going to care but if they see the older kids help maybe the little kids would think how the big kids helped n see how much they helped them and would still want to help others when they get older. The little kids always look up to the big kids. Also maybe the little kids won't gave up so easy. Helping in community service would also help the big kids because they would be thinking of other, they will feel good about them self's when their done, and that well help them get into a good collage when they are older just for helping in the community. When the older kids have kids of their own they can tell them how they helped the community and will want their kids to be in it too. Helping others is the right way to go and to never give up in what you believe in.

I feel that cleaning up the community is a good way to keep the community clean. It is a good idea to get the kids involved, but I don't feel that all the kids should have too. Some kids don't have the time and effort to do those kind of activities. For example, some kids might have to do an outside activity, like sports, and don't want to take time out of doing fun activities. Maybe they don't have enough time during the day to do even those things.

I am on a basketball team myself I don't have enough time after school to do my homework. Plus during my free time, I like to do things with my friends. If you want kids to be cleaning up the community, have the ones that volunteer. Sometimes cleaning up the community isn't such the best thing to do. A school shouldn't have to worry parents that their kids have to clean the community and be at a certain place at a certain time. parents should let their kids pick if they want to clean the community. Parents should teach to pick up after themselves, but not to clean others trash forcefully.

Some kids will want to clean a community. I say that you, as the principal, should take a vote on what to do. I'll just say that I don't have the time to clean the community, but others might, so let the kids decide. If they decide not to clean the community, then let the kids at school decide on what to do with the community and go from there. Don't take my advice, I am just an opinion. Just make sure to do what's right for the kids.",3,Community service,Independent

Since you were deciding if all student should do community service. Well I think you are right because student should tutor elementary students or help clean litter. For example if an elementary school need tutor students either in the middle school or high school student should volunteer but the student don't want to help. Also what if you need more people to help clean the school because the custodian are in there day off but you don't know who can help you but some volunteer like student but they don't want to help. What if you begged the administration if the school can volunteer on helping on anything if possible. Then the school have something they can help on but student don't want to volunteer.

I do believe that you should make our school do community service.

Every body may not want to do it but its a good way on making us work together and helping our community out. There are a lot of things that each student could do: tutoring, cleaning up liter, raising money for school activity's and so on. Every student could have a place in it they may think that it will be a waste of time but we can show them that its not and is really fun. We could clean up out around the school and plant flowers in the spring time. Have bake sales and dances to get money for school trips and activity's. The students could even dance at the dances with would be fun. Also, tutoring younger kids would be fun too helping them learn to read and write. That would mean a lot to them, seeing older kids come down wanting to help them, that would encourage them to do better. Therefore, i do believe community service should be apart of are school.

I believe that students doing community service is a very helpful and responsible thing to do , but I think students should not be required to participate in it. Although this could benefit in many ways like helping make students more responsible, it could also be a bad decision as well. Many students have after-school activities that are very important to them and the forced community service could take away their free time and activities. the people who participate in community service now do it for the joy of helping others, so if students are not happy about it then what is the point?

I would suggest telling students how they can help make a difference, showing opportunities of community service and the benefits. Forcing it upon them would make many students unhappy, teenagers don't like being told what to do, they like being told how to do it.

I hope you will take my advice into deep consideration when making your decision.

Thank you for the great idea, students should be required to perform community service. Many students don't have anything to do and giving them the opportunity to help some one or to help there community would give them a great responsibility. If every student was required to perform community service they would all feel proud of what they are doing to improve there community. Many peoples community service are to tutor elementary school children or to help at a local library. If every student did that or something similar then they would have a nicer community.

A community is a group of people who stick together. Every student is a part of it then why not help to make it nicer or cleaner? Me and my friends like helping little kids in our elementary school. It makes me happy to know that I am helping little kids grow and learn . I like doing this because when I was young there were older people who came and help us at the elementary school. When ever someone needed help they would be there to help us, whether it was to help us open our milk or to help us with a project. So I believe younger kids see us at there hero's that are there to help them. Who knows, maybe when they get older they might feel the same and help there community by doing community service.

A service is something good you are doing. If every student in our school did community ""service"" they would all be doing something good. Doing something good would not only help them but the people around them. Everyone would have a goal on there mind on what to achieve. Everybody would be kind to each other, they would be friendlier to one another.

Having a cleaner, nicer and friendlier community is what everybody wants. Giving every one a sense of responsibility. Making people feel proud of what they have done or help achieve. Helping little kids open there snack to helping an elderly woman down the street. There are many ways to help your community and people out there might not even know what they are capable of. So I think that your idea of requiring students to perform community service is wonderful idea. Students our there could make a change either in their life or in someone else life.

Well to start with, i personally would love for us to do community service. But i also know that a lot of other students may not. But i think students should be required to have community service. There are always ways to make things fun!

For example ... painting over the graffiti, i mean come on who doesn't like to paint. This is one way you cane have fun while helping out your community. Another way is to read with younger kids. You never know they could pick out a book you have never even read and you may think it is hilarious, and on the bright side you could be having a blast while helping out. And i don't know about you but to me those are some awesome ways to help the community. And that is only two of the millions of fun ways we can have fun while doing community service.

And if some students say ""This is a waist of my time i could be doing better things."" Well to be honest kids now in the earlier generation are getting involved with drugs, gangs, violence, ext. and to me this is a way to keep them away from that. Doing this community service could help open the eyes of some people and show them they can help make a difference, in today's education, and enrolment. they just need to start small and pretty soon this will rub off to others and our world will be a better place.

Also if we do community service other people might see how helpful this is and also want to get involve. Including the younger kids and this may help our change our chances for a better community in the feature.

So yeah of course i think we should be required to do community service, because we are helping our world. And I'm pretty sure a lot of other students will like it once they try it!!!!!!!

I know it is something important for everybody to do ,but it is also important for you to understand that some people just don't have the time or just don't want to do it.

I have some friends that are too busy to be doing community service because they have jobs or are taking care of siblings. Please do not require us to do it there are many people that don't want to .Secondly I don't think many people do it, especially all the trouble makers .They are the kids who really don't want to do it ,and that means more meetings with you .Now I know you really don't want to deal with that ,so why bother do the requirement .",2,Community service,Independent

I think its a great idea to for people to do community service . Its a great thing to do to keep our countries and states clean and keep the environment clean. Its also good labor work for people to do, they will get a great workout from it.

It also helps build up muscle, and its better to do that instead of being at home or at the movies or the mall sitting around being lazy all day not doing anything. But in other peoples view they might think that we make them do it because we don't want to go outside or want to get dirty or be out in the sun all day. It would also be a good idea to require students to do it because they can learn new things from it and so that people and students can learn how it feels to work and what people have to do each day to keep food on the tables and pay bills for their kids and how hard you have to work to get paid. So they can get a real job experience for that day and see how they might change after they do community service or how they might feel learning how hard people have to work to keep their families in shape and keep them in a good home that they are comfortable in. So they can get a real reality job experience. But whatever happens their going to have to do it some day or another cause once they grow up their going to be on there own and are going to have to pay bills and taxes and to keep food on the table for their families.

In my opinion, students should be required to do community service. If every student participated in community service, just imagine how nice and clean our community could be. If we have 500-600 students in our school, that is 500-600 community workers that could be helping our community get more developed and a cleaner and nicer area to live in knowing that we have the support of everyone helping.

Also, community service is a good way to meet new people. It will bring everyone together so that everyone knows everyone. We would have a lower crime rate, lower than it already is. It could also be a family project, where a whole family helps out and that would bring that family closer together. If 500 students are picking up trash off the street, the streets would be so much cleaner and that could possibly stop people from littering in the first place. Not only would it make the community look nicer, it would make you feel better about yourself, knowing that you made a difference in the community.

When students partake in community service, not only are they helping the community and helping themselves, they are helping to raise the property value on homes. If the streets get cleaned up and people hear about how nice our community is, then more people will want to join our community and be apart of a special group of people always helping each other out. Participating in the community would also lower our number of obese people considering that you will be getting active and not sitting home on the couch with potato chips, watching television or playing video games. It would lower your electricity bill since you will be outside more.

You make a special bond with people when you know that they are all helping out for the same reason. When you help out with your friends, it is much easier to do it then trying to do it on your own. You have someone there to support you and keep pushing you to make a difference. All schools should partake in community service. The landscape could just be the most beautiful thing if more people plant flowers. These are the reasons i believe we should participate in community service.

E4E456EF2132,"To the principal:

I have heard that you are thinking about having all the kids in your school to do service around the community.

Some people have disagreed with this idea, but I think it's great. It would help kids learn not to be selfish and learn how to help others, but those are not the only reasons why.

First of all, it help kids get involved with good things.

For instance, many kids might go to a community building like a mall, and do nothing helpful to others.

But if they, for instance, joined a recycling committee, they would not only help others, but care for the environment.

What good will come out of going to the mall? As well as this, many kids on a regular basis go home and play video games for hours or watch TV.

Community service would be a good opportunity to expand their horizons and learn how to not only be social, but teach them that they're not the only person in the world.

Second, the community would be better if many kids did service.

I know that a large number of elementary schools need volunteers, but there isn't many because so many of the kids' parents work.

Community service could offer a good after- school job for a teenager, as well as helping the teachers have more students understanding the topic, which could improve learning.

As well as this, the volunteers could actually enjoy the experience, and might want to become a teacher.

I know it's just a thought, but you never know.

Lastly, kids could benefit if they did this.

People would praise them for volunteering, and who doesn't want to get complimented.

Community service could also help future job opportunities because it would add so much to your resume.

Think about it, nothing bad will come out of the service, so it should be enforced.

Community service is most definitely not something that's a hard thing to do, so kids should not be whining about benefiting thirty- minutes of their time.

I think this opportunity would be good for students, so no matter what people think, students should have to provide community service.

I think that students should be required to perform community service. The reason that I think students should be required to perform community service is students lived in this city too so, I think that they need to do something for their city. For example: recycling is not the hard thing to do. Student can tell their friends to recycle to help the environment. Student can uses the paper in a correct, but not wasting the paper. For what I know the paper are made out of trees and tree help human a lot for their health. Trees give oxygen to human. Student can also help by throwing the garbage in the garbage can. Even if they see it on the street they can pick it up and throw it in the garbage. As a human being we can do a lot of things to help the environment. We can plant more tree instead of cut down the trees. Students are the people that have educated so, they should know what the right things to do. Students today, they should know how lucky they are. People back then, they can't go to school without money so, most of the people didn't go to school. Instead of going to school they have to work to help their parents. Today, in the United States we have public school everywhere. All the kids in the United States are require to go to school. To be honest in my country we don't have public school like in America. All the poor kids in my country didn't go to school like they suppose to. They have to work to get the money to help their parents.

I think to do the community service is not the hard thing to do. Nothing you can't do if you try. Nobody born as a winner or a loser you decided what yourself will be or can be. I think students today, are wasting too much stuff. I think they should stop wasting all of that stuffs for nothing. They should save all the things that they has and use it widely. Everything is bought by money nothing in this world is for free. There are so many things that students can do or as the human being we can do. In school you can help your friends with what you know and they don't. I was helping my friends with their work, when they don't understand something I always feel welcome to help them.

I think we should be required to do community service because it could get us ready for high school when we have to do community service for our credits and instead of learning the hard way by having to way up really early and not being used to the schedule and being grumpy we could just get up and be ready to work and know that we have something to do before we stay up all night and not be able to be ready to work and it could also help us when we are out of school it can get us ready for when we have a job as a grownup so that we can earn money to make a living for ourselves and not have to rely on our parents.

Another reason this would be good is because we will learn responsibility in knowing that we have something to take care of and to know that we should do the right thing and help people that are in need so that we can feel good about ourselves and also so that we can know that there's always some way to help someone. We could help out by giving money to shelters so that they can buy food or sending cans to the homeless or even giving them cloths or sheets so they wont be cold at night or maybe even little things like talking to them and telling them not to give up and to try to keep on pushing till they can get there own house and to get a job to take care of there families.

The next reason that we should have to perform community service is because a lot of these stars and stuff don't give back to there community even though they have all the money that they have so you can show the people that someone cares enough to help them instead of flashing all there fancy things knowing that other people have nothing. If you were to watch a show like M.T.V cribs you would see some of those people have things they never even wore or they wore once and never wear it again they could send those nice cloths to the homeless since they aren't going to use them again.

108363724F15,"I don't think that it should be required to do community service. It could be something that a student would like to do or a student could do it for extra credit. If a student has done something that has broken school rules, then I would suggest community service. If they wanted to do it, then they could stay after school and help out. They could help the younger students with their homework or something similar to that. They should be able to choose what type of community service they would like to do. If nothing interests them, they should at least try something and see if they enjoy it.

In my opinion, if a student must do community service, it should be related to school. For example, they could help clean up their cafeteria or tutor another student who is struggling with a particular subject. If nothing of those interests the student, then they can always choose something else. If they would like to suggest another job, they should be able to do so. It's not that difficult to let a few students get together and think of an after school program for people who have to do community service.

If I had to do community service, I would most likely help out with tutoring. I would probably help out with math, for it has always been my best subject. It does get harder every year, but that should just make students work harder and get their work done. The teachers my also get stricter or they could be extremely helpful. I've found it to be about half and half. Every other year or so a teacher will come along and give you no help at all. They might just give you the work and tell you to do it. Other times, they can help you with any problem you seem to have. Either way, it IS required to get your work done.

All of these thoughts are just suggestions, but if they were used, I think it would be very helpful. They may or may not be good suggestions, but to me, their my thoughts and there isn't really a way for me not to think. When I do think about it, I think that they're good suggestions. That's just my opinion on my own thoughts, but again, they are just my thoughts. Also, I think that any one of these would be a good suggestion. And lastly, a student should not be made to do something. If they wish to do community service, they may. If not, that's their choice. If it's not required, then they cannot be made to do it.",3,Community service,Independent

Dear Principal,

It has come to my attention that some students have been performing community service, but others think it takes too much time away from what they need and want to do. Also, you are trying to decide whether to require students to perform community service for a grade. So, I am writing you this letter to express my position on whether students should be required to do community service or not. I strongly support students to be required to do community service because it will teach them responsibility, help them learn what it is like to work for a living, and the students who participate will become more mature.

First, I strongly support students to be required to do community service because it will teach them responsibility. In a nation wide poll, 60% of parents think their child is not responsible with their time and money. With community service requirements, this rate could go down with more students completing community service. I think this would make many parents very happy, because they have more responsible children.

Secondly, community service would help teens learn what it is like to work for a living. In many cases, students don't know what it is like to work because their parents are always buying everything they need to survive and grow up. They might take advantage of their parents because of getting everything they want. So, community service would help them understand their parents perspective a little bit more.

Last but not least, the students who participate in the community service will become more mature. When they show up to volunteer, they would see how seriously most jobs are taken, and learn that it will be them working hard when they get out of college, or even during college. So, they should mature a lot during community service.

In conclusion, I strongly support students to be required to do community service because the students who participate in the community will become more mature, the work would help teens learn what it is like to work for a living, and it will teach them responsibility. So by now, I hope you have made up your mind on whether students should be required to complete community service or not. Just think of the number of students coming to your office in trouble will decrease. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my letter.

To me community service is very important. It helps others who are in need. If you want to assign people to do community service go right ahead. But most people don't want to because they think it's a waste of there time.

So you can solve this one way, you can show these students how great charity is!

For example helping clean up litter is a great way to prevent pollution. And reading to young children helps there education. Talking to elders gives them hope, and helping the homeless keeps them alive.

If you can show these student that its not a waste of time then maybe they will help. My advice is to prove to them that community service is a great thing. If people can take up about two hours of there lives for charity, then the world would be a better place to live in. And not just our school should do this i think everyone should.

But you cant force people to do community service if they don't want to because most likely they wont show up. And then they will get an F on that assignment, and they will fail!.. And nobody wants that.

if they don't want to do a great thing for the planet, or for young children or even family's or elders then that's there problem, they can just do extra credit. But i still think you should show them how it will help the world. Ex; Have an assembly to talk about community service!..

If you do decide that you want to assignee the task of community service, then i would like the position of helping homeless people. i think they need more help than anybody. But that's just my opinion. I would like to donate food and clothing to a fund who does help homeless people.

i think that this assignment is a wonderful idea!

Requiring students to perform community service is an excellent idea. Children these days take life for granted; they live very selfishly, with no concern for anyone else. Community service is a great way to give back and feel good about your self. Just by giving an hour of your time to help out children at day-care, or to serve food at a shelter, can really make a difference. Students should be required to perform a certain number of community service hours because its a great learning experience in how to work with others and also, its an excellent way to give back to the community which does so much for you everyday. Community service is where we can just give a little to make a big difference.

With school taking up most of the day, and then children sticking themselves inside the rest of the evening with homework and such, they really don't have much time to interact with people. Community service is a great way to teach us how to get along and work with others. We don't get jobs until we're 16, so until then we only spend time with people we know. Whether you're helping out at a nursing home or daycare center, you get to meet new people. We don't always get along with everyone we meet, but this is an opportunity to learn how to act in public when we are working and frustrated. Performing community service hours is a great experience to make new friends and teach you how to work with different people.

Thinking of our teachers, and coaches, and everyone other person who works in our town, we realize how many people work so hard just for us. Their jobs aren't easy, however, that doesn't stop them for being the utmost polite and helpful towards us. Simple things like staying an hour or so to help clean up the room after playtime at a daycare, or organizing mail for the patients at a nursing home can really help someone out. It really feels great when you're working so hard and someone goes out of their way to help you. Its a great way to give back to those who have done so much for us. It doesn't have to be a lot of time, just an hour or so, and we can really make a difference in our community.

TEACHER_NAME, community service hours really should be an added requirement for passing. Community service is a great way to teach students life lessons that they will only experience other wise when they are adults. We can make friends with people we've never known before. We can help out those who have always helped us out. Colleges love to see those students who take an extra step to give back, rather than those who just sit back and enjoy everything that has been given to them. Its such an easy thing to do, that really won't take as much time as we think it might. We never know until we try it, we may end up really liking it!",5,Community service,Independent

I think community service should not be a requirement ,but strongly suggest it to the students. I think if you want to do it as a whole school put it in a field trip. If you're the principal of a public school you should go to a big public area and split the kids into groups. If you're the principal to a small private school with around one-hundred kids go to a public park.

I go to a small private school and we did it last year. I found it alright because I were with my friends and we were talking and making jokes the entire time. Plus we played on the playground when we were done. As strange as that sounds it was a ton of fun. And where we went was a small zoo so I got to look at animals too.

I remember when we walked there I was playing with my plastic bag and I popped it. I figured out how to fix it by tying it. It wasn't a big rip so I could tie a knot by it to close it up. I certainly had better field trips but it was alright. I hope you use this idea for your school. At a public school I'm not sure how well this will turn out.

For a public school you might have to make it a requirement. I think you should hand out sheets to the students and have them write down the hours they did and have the person who was in charge sign it. Oh yeah also have them have a requirement of at least ten hours a semester. I hope you have good luck with your task and choose which idea would work for your school. One more thing don't let the students who get in trouble a lot find goose eggs. Some of them won't make it. Trust me.",2,Community service,Independent
27D28F942C45,"Dear Principal,

I believe that students should be required to perform community service. Most students think that it is a waste of time and they would rather be doing something else such as shopping or going to the movies with friends. Community service would teach young people that they can make their community a better place by doing something as small as picking up trash on the side of the highway or helping the elderly cross the street. If all students did community service like helping homeless people, not only would they be changing someone's life but they would be learning to value what they have and not take it for granted. If students are required to perform community service then it could help many adolescents stay away from drugs and alcohol and do something that could affect many people. Even by going to and elderly home students can make someone's day a lot better. Other forms of community service such as tutoring can help people stay in school so they can go to a good college, and get a job to support themselves and their families. Also, it is required to do a certain amount of time of community service in order to graduate high school. Community service also looks good on applications for jobs and colleges.

Community service is easy and anyone can do it. Therefore, students can take some time out of their day to be selfless and help other people in their community.

3BC3AB612FAA,"Dear, Principal everyone should do community service because its good for the community. Everyone should step in and make things happen even if doing community service takes up your time you should still do it. Doing community service takes up time but when you are doing it for a good thing it doesn't matter. The communities would be better if everyone just did a little for it. In the passage the elementary students are doing a good thing because they are kids that want to help the community. The kids that need more time are ""The cool kids"" they have everyday to do something and if they would realize that 1 hour of their time doing work isn't so bad. Your community can be a better place and environment. So please help the community better and make things better for yourself. Taking the day to do something to help something is something i would want to do everyone should want to do community service. If you help, the next day you can feel great about what you did. In the end it will make you smarter and kind and respectful. So yes everyone should do community service and help.

76652F60F5D1,"Dear Principle,

I do not think that all students should be required to perform community service. I do not agree with this requirement because not all kids have time in their regular day to perform community services. Some students have after school sports that take up much of their time. Other students already have things at home they need to take care of. Some could have to watch younger brothers and sisters while their parents work, or watch pets while the parents work. Some students even are already starting jobs young to raise a little extra money to help out their family. I know that many students already have families, if not their own, with children that they babysit for money while the family's parents work. Community service would be a great thing to do for the students that have time for it out of their daily schedule, but for others, it just could not be possible. It is always nice to perform community service to help out, but sometimes there are other commitments that children have, and they can't just drop all of their commitments for this. That would be irresponsible, and I'm sure you want all of your students to be responsible in their commitments and outside of school activities or jobs. I'm sure their parents wouldn't allow them to break other commitments as well. So in the end, I think community service would be a great thing to volunteer, but should not be placed upon us as a requirement. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I think we should make everyone do community service! It could let people have a different aspect on the community. Newton County is not that clean and not everybody is superb in school. I have some thoughts and questions about how you are going to make students do this.

First, Newton County has lots of liter! We have to do something about it. Certain students should be assigned roads and highways and pick up as much trash as possible every Friday! Then we can pride in of county. It will be so much more delightful.

Another idea is to tutor students every other day! If we have eighth grade students tutor sixth and seventh grade students then hopefully our AP scores will improve! Your probably wondering how this will help the eighth graders. Well, you have to know something before you can teach it to somebody else, right? If all eight graders know the material then all of us will have to tutor someone! You can make it required so that everyone will have to learn all the material!

Lastly, I have a concern. I'm not sure how you could make everyone do community service because some students have after school activities and you can't make them stop for other people. Please let me know soon, so I can help you!

I understand how you feel about community service, and I too agree it is very important. But some students have things to do like baby-sit for their parents or extra- curricular activities and sports. I do not think community service should be required but it can be an extra-curricular activity. I think you should consider the idea, and take in the fact that students have other important things to do. Jobs of some sort, or helping their parents out.

I believe us students have enough to do already like homework and studying, and we also do like social time and to have fun. Its not very fun to pick up trash with your friends and talk than it is to talk to them at the movies. Now I think it should be the students choice if they would want to pick up trash, or help tutor younger children. That is my strong opinion on the situation.

I also think it could be a punishment for students who misbehave. I mean, who wants to pick up someone else's trash, its gross I think. And students who choose not to pick up trash on their free time shouldn't have to be forced to did it. If they want to pick up trash, it should be because they want to and not because they have to. Please think about it, thank you for your time.

67D40BFD6844,"Dear Mrs. Principal:

I am writing to inform you that in my opinion, all students should be required to complete a certain amount of community service each year. I think that community service can improve character and also encourage students to help others. Many schools across the country have begun to require a certain amount of community service hours as part of their final grades.

As far as improving character goes, I believe community service can be a huge help. If a student volunteers picking up trash, they will have someone in charge of giving them directions for where and when to pick up trash. They will be required to respect this person and obey this person's instructions, which is what students must do in school very often. I believe that students are purposefully resistant towards teacher and administration figures, but if they have someone outside of school teaching them respect and obedience, their tendency to respect authority figures in school will be stronger.

I also believe community service can build character because of the impact that it can have on your life. Some children have never experienced the feeling of accomplishment when they know they have done something to help another person. If you choose to volunteer in children's hospital, the reactions from the sick children you are helping can be truly inspiring. I think this teaches kids to be grateful, thus building character.

In conclusion, I believe community service can only benefit students in this school. I believe the overall school behavior would improve and I believe we would grow stronger as a school community. Therefore, I think all students should be required to complete a certain amount of community service each year.",4,Community service,Independent
C643288B2DE3,"Dear Principal _____,

Community service, I believe, should be required in high school. Some students are complaining that it should not, but the only reason they dislike this idea is because it would waste their own time. Should we not think of others over ourselves? I support having community service required, because it improves students' character, looks good on a college application, and will help the people who need it the most.

First, community service would improve a student's character. An experience such as this would open their eyes and show them a different point of view. Walking in someone else's shoes would hopefully give them a change of heart or view towards community service or charity. Even if they are not helping out people in need, but instead cleaning up the trash in the local park, it would still give them a change of mind. Maybe next time they are hanging around the park they will bother to save their soda can or candy wrapper until they can throw it away properly. I believe that experiences like these can almost definitely result in changes in a person.

Secondly, having community service hours looks great on a college application! Most colleges not only look at a student's grades but the amount of time they have put into sports, extra curricular, and in their community. By requiring students to put time into community service for school, you are helping them kill two birds with one stone. It is almost like having a project for school that you must do and receiving extra credit for doing it.

Last of all, community service is a great way to reach out and to help those who need it most. Although people may not realize it, there are so many people in your own community who are poor or homeless. Even helping tutor younger children will improve the community. Having all students in the high school go out and volunteer would be a help to everyone in this situation. People will be helped, and students will feel good about themselves, while also raising their chance of getting into their choice college.

Improving character, looking good on a college application, and helping our community and the people who live in it are all reasons why community service hours should be required in school. There is no reason why we should not get out into our community and help out any way we can! If students think it will only be a waste of their time, maybe after they get a taste of it and the benefits it reaps, they will think again.",5,Community service,Independent

I think its a good thing to have community service after school it will help children stay out of trouble. Children wont get involved in to gangs and if they do community service they wont be into drugs and they will get a better chance of succeeding in this world.

Community service would help the children of the future and make the world a better place with less gangs and drug dealers. The children would be better of making the world be greener and a nicer place to live with less violence in the world. With the kids doing community service they should feel good and feel like they achieved something. Kids might see it as a waste off time but in the long run it will have payed off and kids will be much wiser in the future.

Children doing community service are giving up some of there time to help other people eat sleep etc. The children learn to be responsible and respectful to others and themselves. Children helping the community are helping other little kids with the school studies so they could do good in school and the little kids have someone good to look up to when there growing up.

If children are helping the community maybe there parents or there grandparents will help a little boy read or pick up litter on the side of the road etc. There parents are helping the community so its like double the goodness. Parents would help people more and be more respectful and be thankful for what they have in life. And start a new life with better decisions.

In conclusion with community service after school kids would be better off in life and the world would be safer and less gangs and drugs in the country. People would be thankful for what they have and not be so selfish and they would see how other people lived. That's why I think its a positive thing to have community service after school.

15B8ED0E3817,"You should not require all students to do community service. You should make it extra credit if they do though. If you made it mandatory then the students would not be doing it out of their own will. They would just be doing it because of the fact that it is mandatory. If you made it extra credit or if they got a casual day or something for motivation then students would do it for that purpose and might actually enjoy it.

You should not require them to do it for a grade so that they don't just do it for a grade. They have to do it for a purpose. Such as helping them but even doing it for extra credit is bad too. It is bad because then the students would just be doing the community service for extra credit not for the actual purpose of helping the community. There could be some other ways that they would do it for the purpose.

A way that they could do it for a reason would be if you emailed the students parents and told them that you would like it if the students would take part in some community service once in a while that would be better. If you did that then the parents would just say no our schedule does not have room for it. Another thing that the parents could say is that they just don't want to. They could also say that we will try to get in some community service when ever our schedule has an opening for it. But i think that if you sent an email to the parents than you would get more students doing community service than you would if you made it mandatory.

If the principal made it mandatory at my school I wouldn't do it any way. I would not do it anyway because I do not have that much time in my schedule between sports and homework and school. I think if I cut out all of the time that I had free than it would be about an hour right after dinner where I usually am getting ready to go to sleep.

They should do community service. You may wonder why i' m writing this is because, the people who love to do community service should get extra credit. They should also get extra time after and before school to hang out with their friends. you ask why?? because they help a lot doing community service. cleaning up is good to the environment, but their wasting their time just doing the same thing over and over again. Like helping kids, is good to help them do better but you can get annoyed very easy. cleaning up the litter is good because if an animal eats aluminum foil it can choke and then die, you don't want that to happen right??? But the people who help should get day off of working and do school work, or help a teacher, that can be fun.

For the people who think community service is really weird, they should think twice because it can be fun, but it helps a lot in life. It can help the fact that you can do something that helps. ......ALOT! like you can help at home. Earn cash, to buy cleaning supply's. That can help save animals, humans, life.

Some people use that as a time to do community service but i believe they should start even before that like they're first year of high school like picking up litter and helping the less fortunate. Giving time to someone younger than you. You could actually end up helping them succeed in life , maybe they just needed that little extra push to help them follow there dreams in life.

ED4AC32945B3,"Just take a moment to think about how your community is around you, Think off how our world and community is, Think about everything that is happening to our school campuses, and this is why I believe that students should be required to perform community service.

To begin with, students have nothing much better to do other than go hang out with friends or be home doing nothing. For example, when students are in school what are they doing ? Most of the time yes we're doing work in our classes but think about after lunch when you have nothing to do, us students should take the time to help make our community a better place even if its just by picking up a few pieces of paper off the floor. With just those couple of papers you've made a change in our lives. Also think about when students go through passing period most of the time all the students do is stand there and talk, you should put students to do community service it'll give them something to do other than waste valuable time that can be used for something good.

Another point to consider, community service will keep some students off the street so they wont make a bad decision and end up in a bad situation or hurt. For example, just last week there was a boy named OTHER_NAME he was fourteen years old and went to SCHOOL_NAME. One day he was hanging out with his friends and I guess he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time because just that day he ended up getting shot. I believe that if schools made kids perform community service things like this wouldn't happen because students will have spent more time in school helping to make a difference other than being out on the streets possibly about to get hurt.

It'll keep some students off the streets, give students a chance to help make a difference, and also I believe students should perform community service because most students don't have anything better to do.",4,Community service,Independent

I am an eighth grader in your school and I love the school. But lately there has been talk about community service and how it affects student life and if you want it as a school wide activity or a choice for any one who wants to do it.

Being a student i have a view on this situation and how it could be possibly resolved.

As a student i have a lot of projects and work to do in school and out of school.

The problem that many people would have with community service being mandatory is that it would be added inn with home work and even a job that some people could have. It also would be hard to fit this in to any schedule or to not do one thing because of it. There for many of us that would be stressed and have many things to do Because of it.

An idea to help you add community service to our schedule is have a sign up for people who want to do it or have it as an extra credit opportunity for the history and language arts classes this would help many kids to get better grades and be more involved in there community when they wanted to be. it would also be structured and would be more enjoyable to the person that got the finished community service slips

One more suggestion would be to have a school wide day when every on goes out and does community service once a month. It would be fun to do it with your whole grade and friends also you would have more motivation from people you know. ( Charity events would be good to)

757C4090BE0E,"Dear Principal,

I feel that you should require each student to perform at least one community service task each semester. This would help students learn responsibility and sacrifice by having them give up their free time to help out their community. The services they do could be as easy as reading to people with disabilities. They could also clean up the highway, or help remove graffiti.

Many of your students are already doing these things and more. They also feel that it would be good for the school to aid the community. Some of them don't even go outside of their neighborhood while helping. It's just so easy to be a helping hand!

Requiring service community tasks may not help all of the students to become more responsible, but it will make many of them think more about helping others. This is good for them in the long run, for when they become adults. Many jobs require talking to and working with other people. Responsibility will make it easier to do your job. And making sacrifices is something that you are going to have to do sometime in your life. Whether you become a parent, or a teacher, or even a doctor, you will have to give up some of your time and maybe even something bigger. Having students perform community service tasks will only help in this area.

Of course, you will anger some students by doing this, but there will never be a decision made anywhere about anything that will make everybody happy. And only one task per semester isn't much. It's so much better than having them do at least four a year, or something like that.

And sometimes i help people who can't do things on their own. I think everyone should take part in community service. It is very nice for people to do so.

I think community service is a great idea. I am for every one having to do community service. I think it is a great idea because it will teach people character. I think that we should all take part in cleaning up litter to protect our earth and keep it safe for our future kids. I try to convince people to do community service to help others out when in need.

Also i do community service for my church. it makes me feel better about myself. Doing community service isn't just because people want me to do it, It's because i like to do it and i love helping people out. What i do to help my community out is usually pick up litter and help people who can't do things for themselves. I am always up for community service. I love to help people out not matter what. I will help any one at anytime.

I think every one should help out in the community because it brings us all together into one big family. It also helps to clean up our environment. Everyone has enough time to help perform some type of community service. Even if its just for a half hour. I try to convince my friends also to do community service. Sometimes they do but sometimes they don't. No one is ever to busy to not have time to help out their community.

I do think that helping our community by doing community serves is very important.

We need to keep our community clean. If we don't it will just look like a big trash can.

It is important that kids help, it's not so hard to give up one hour of your day to help the community. If we start with the little things we can make a difference and do something bigger and better.

I think the reason many kids my age don't want to help is because their just stubborn an not willing to make some time for helping things like this one speacialy. Kids think that they have better things to do than help others even I'm like that sometimes.

We don't really understand the importance of this task if we let our towns, our cities, or communities build with trash we'd be destroying our world. I think its that kids old and young want to help our community . It builds character and i would like the opportunity to do community serves.

It's really offal to see trash on the side of the rode or highway because someone was careless on just through it out of the car or on the side of the rode while they were walking and that's why i require that we start community serves.      ",3,Community service,Independent

Community service is good for our health, and we need our community to stay clean. First, I would like to say that vehicles are one reason we need to clean the community. Second off, I would also like to point out how we throw trash on the ground, and we don't need trash on the ground we need more service to the community. I say that we do need to spend more time helping out this community, it would prove a great help for our people. We could learn how to just pick up something without being instructed to do so. We need a sapid community because with a decayed community we could get sick easily, and as students and educators we shouldn't want that. If we are sick we would not get chances at going to get better knowledge at school. That's why we need to clean our community, and as I said earlier we need to use cars less because they pollute our airspace, and if we breath in that pollution we get sick as well. Are you willing to let the community stand in harsh conditions or will you listen to my testimony? Just because my peers think the opposite does not mean you listen to them. They may sometimes have important things to do but that's does not mean they are prefect and can't help. Do you want a healthy environment for future generations to come? I want a great environment so we could get our education, play out side, and breath fresh air. I want all these things for the community wouldn't you want the same?",2,Community service,Independent
53CD63A1A92E,"I think that the student should be able to volunteer for community service if they want to. If they don't, then they may not do work as well. When someone volunteers, they usually want to do what they're doing. If someone is more forced on doing it, they may not put in a lot of effort. Time may be lost during a school day if everyone volunteers also. People who did volunteer would have to make up the work the next day at school, because they wouldn't have time in the day for work besides the work they're already doing. But others may need to do homework so it could get in the way of education. That's another reason they should not be forced to do it. Also people may have extra curricular activities such as sports. Community service would get in the way of them having a chance for playing a sport. But an advantage of making them do it, they would meet new people while they're at it. It'd be more effective if they only did it once a week. As if they had one day to do it. So they don't miss anything in school, or miss out on sports. The coaches or instructors of the sport will be told ahead of time that they would not make practice once a week. And any homework given the day before they do community service, it should be due 2 days after it is given. So they have plenty of time to do it. But if they were not forced to go only a certain amount of people should go. If they had a class of just one person in it, then it would be weird and they probably wouldn't learn anything. They would say something like, ""How come I have to learn while everyone else isn't even at school?"" So if the class has say 30 people, only 15 people should be able to go volunteer. Or even 10. Both of the options have ups and downs, but letting them volunteer on their own is a better idea. Most students would hate the idea of having to go to community service, and I know I don't want to.",3,Community service,Independent

I believe all students must do tasks to assist the community. Students should participate in helping the community because it helps our community and city possibly even our state look good and it will make the children performing the tasks more responsible. Most kids helping with the community will feel good about themselves they will think to themselves wow i really did help make a difference in my community. They will often take pride in their work. We should help our communities.

Our community should have a right to look good. The children of OTHER_NAME should help clean our streets, help the needy, raise money for the city parks or even tutor the children in OTHER_NAME elementary schools. By doing this, the tourists will begin to say good things about the city of OTHER_NAME and the city of OTHER_NAME. We will receive more tourists and people interested in moving to OTHER_NAME or OTHER_NAME. We could even assist the needy, if we assist the needy we will look like a community that cares about our residents. When we help the younger we are helping our future lawyers and doctors even our future engineers with their education.

During our time in OTHER_NAME or OTHER_NAME helping the needy tutoring the children or participating in food drives we should stop to think to ourselves wow i really made a difference in not only their lives but my life also. we will feel depended on and we will most likely feel thankful. We will feel good about ourselves and we will want to participate in more activities to help our community.

Here in OTHER_NAME and OTHER_NAME our community is beautiful and clean. Whom do we have to thank for that you ask? The children of OTHER_NAME and the children of OTHER_NAME. Why of course all this work is due to the children of our community, we will see news headlines and it will be on kcal nine news and fox eleven and we children will be proud of ourselves and show pride in our community. So Mr. principal i hope you have come to an conclusion that you should encourage students to participate in community service, not only for the good of the people but for the good of the hearts of the children.

If your trying to decide if your going to make students complete community service I think the answer is yes. I think this because everyone should serve in a part of helping the community and what better way of doing that than community service. I think students should pick up trash if they see it. This way our community can stay clean and we are helping the community.

We should make time so where we have time to do community and have extra time to do what we want. I think community service is also a good way too keep children out of trouble. By performing community service it helps them to do what's right and what's wrong. I think community service is also good for doing good deeds too.

I think if students do extra time of community service than they should get a type of reward in school like Extra credit in a class that they really need it in. If you do this then kids are getting good grades in school and helping there community at the same time.      ",3,Community service,Independent

Community service is designed to help the community in which volunteer's take on the jobs of things that help out our community. Many kids are out there doing community service while there are kids who decide that community service is not quite worth their time or they have ""better"" things to do. Community service should be mandatory to all students at our school to help the community out.

Kids currently doing community service choose to because there is so many benefits to it. Such as: It may go onto your college application, many high-school's require you do community service anyway so why not start early? Also, doing community service benefits everyone inside your community. Many people are sometimes not as fortunate as you to have the things you have. So, doing community service helps them out. Overall, doing community service should make you as a person feel better about yourself.

Many kids feel that they have better things to do then doing community service. Sure, playing video games or just sitting there doing nothing may sound better to you yourself, but to others not so much. When you do community service it takes kids involved with terrible things such as drugs, alcohol, and smoking off of that because now they do not have that time to go ahead and do those terrible things.

So, when making kids do this community service it makes the less fortunate and the fortunate people all better overall.

I ponder why kids our age feel as to where community service is just some ""stupid thing."" Well, I am sure to you and I and many other people out there in the community feel that community service enhances our community to a better place.

When or if you decide to press community service on all the kids in our school just remember to not be so harsh and forceful. Make it more fun and appealing to the kids. Don't make it feel like its a punishment instead, make it feel like a privilege. This will make more kids want to do it, instead of dreading it. To help, make some fun activities in the community for the kids to do. When they do these activities make it possible for the kids to come together and socialize like they would do without having these community service hours on their mind.

Making kids who do community service benefits everyone. Overall, it would be to everyone's favor if they have to do community service. Present this to our school in the most nicest and exciting way possible.

The whole world will become a better place with community service and having our school join that team is one huge step towards a nicer world.

I personally believe students should participate in community service whether it is picking up litter or tutoring children that need our help, because that is what our environment needs. Maybe not every student but few that really want to help, because if everyone is helping out, I don't think they will get the whole concept, because of there attitude towards helping out with the community.

Anyways, my point is to all this is, there's so many children that could use our help. For example, say a student named John needs help on math for graphing, the teacher could have explained it in several different ways but still no use, if we let students perform in community service to tutor other students who need our help, than it would help out a lot because John probably would understand graphing better with a person his own age explain it to him.

I also think we should be able to perform in community service because the economy's getting real bad, specially since its like no one cares about respect for our environment. Having students clean up the roads, streets, recycle , etc., would be a huge help for everyone. Specially for our own sake, because this is where we live, now i very doubt anyone would want to live in a dirty town, city or even state.

Yes, this may take time away from doing what we want to do, like going to the movies with friends, or hanging out, but I'm sure we could always do those stuff another day. What's more important? Our community or hanging out with friends? I believe our community's way more important. So we should definitely allow students perform in community service, it would even help them learn about taking care of where we live and how to do things right.",3,Community service,Independent

Most students at our school play sports after school, and if they are playing spots how are they going to do community service? I know it is great to help out the community, but we should be able to do it when we want to. I understand that if a student have to have some kind of punishment and have to community service. But I don't think we should have to pick up after other students they should pick up after themselves.

What time does all of this starts? Because some students have to be at home at a certain time. And if we had to do it after we got home from playing sports it would be too dark to see how to do anything.

Community service is important in the country of the

States.

Service in the community can change the place where one is working at.

Finding community service can be easy. It changes the person's character.

I think that the principal should make everyone do service in the community.

The service can change the place where is being done. The place can turn into a cleaner area.

The kids of the community would learn that helping can be a good thing.

The children would learn to not be in gangs.

Many people's life be changed there will less people getting hurt by gangs.

There be more people in collage.

The whole world will be changed.

Secondly finding community service would be easy to find.

Finding a community to help can be where you live at. A soup kitchen can be found near a locate church. There can be an old lady living next door that needs help with grocery. Or you can just donate coats to a coat drive in the winter.

I think you should not make the students do community service. For these three reasons: make it a contest, question the students, and figure out some ways the students can do community service. If they truly care about their community and was not selfish they would consider or all ready doing community service. This should be a option for the students. please consider these things in this letter.

One thing you should consider before making community service a requirement. Ask the students why they aren't doing community service and see if they have a good reason. Like, See if they want too. Maybe, if you encourage them more they would consider it. Even ask the parents. Give both the students and parents some suggestions to help.

The other things is you should make it a contest. Like, make the contest like whoever has the most community service hours; Those students that decide to do the challenge would get rewarded. The students would feel better about themselves for helping out and might even do more community services.

I'm sure that would get more students up and doing more things for the community.

The last thing you should consider is take it in consideration that some of the students may not like getting up and being active. They may like to stay inside playing video games or they could be allergic to something outside. Find some things you can do for the community while being inside. Like, you could babysit some little ones while the parents have a get together or if the community is throwing a barbecue. That would be one example of doing community service but still be able to be inside.

I hope you take these things in consideration. There may be a lot of students wishings they could help out but just hasn't found out how they could help. Give the students some examples of how they could help.

In my opinion every student should have to perform at least one hour of community service per nine weeks. If we do more community service we will have a better safer community and if we have a better safer community we wouldn't have as many troublemakers and gangsters roaming the streets. If troublemakers are roaming the streets it will make it a harder learning environment for everybody because they rare usually a bad influence on eighth grade kids like me. They convince us to drop out of school and do even worse things like sell drugs. But that's not the issue here community service is better for everyone because it teaches had work and determination to students which usually leads to a better life or lifestyle.

these are just a few examples of why community service is better for everyone .it teaches students hard work and determination which leads to a better life .It would clean up the streets and keep troublemakers away from the students .it helps the environment by getting rid of plastic bottles and six pack rings .community service looks really good on a collage application .community service looks good also on a high school application

These are only a few of the reasons why we should be doing community service in fact everyone is the school should have to do at lest an hour of community service even once or twice a month. The truth is community service is just plain good for the people and places of your community so please consider my idea because most of the students who say they have ""better things to do"" will not have such a high success rate as those who do so even if they don't want to do community service make them do it anyway. It wouldn't be fair the students who you made do it if others don't have to also do community service. Not only is it better for the community people will probably have more respect for you if you do community service. This is all i have to say on the matter of community service consider my idea because its a good one.

I think that it would help if every student helped out by doing some type of community service whether it be tutoring at a local elementary school, or picking up litter, or just going by a retirement center and just talking to some of the lonely elders that live there. But I do not think it is a good idea to force them to do it because when you help someone or something like your community it's supposed to be out of the goodness of your heart, not because you have too.

I think that if you do force them to do it then you should only do it once or twice to try to motivate them to help other's or so that maybe they realize that it's not that bad just to do a little bit here and there to help out other's in a nice and helping way. I think that the best way to approach this matter is to create a club or committee that does community service and helps people realize that it is important to do community service to help out your community.

Those are just a few reasons why I think that your students should not have to be forced to do community service. Although students do have a lot of time to waist, I do believe that there should be a community wide program developed to try to influence more people to get involved in community service, not just students. I believe that if you can get one community very strong in community service that it might spread like a virus to surrounding areas and make a huge difference in not only your community, but others too.

I consider that community service is a great that you have came up with.

there fore there is many great reasons that community service is a very good for us. first of all it helps kids show responsibly for there selves, also its a great way of showing friendship among each other and there fore it a good thing for kids to be getting started if ever in there life they become some thing.

To begin with, community service shows your kids how to grow up and start being responsible among their acts as well as others. that's a way they will learn how too be in time in places they need to be. For example helping a kid in there home work after school that's showing the time they need to be there and also show them the things they have too do. But also responsibility is not a harm is a very good thing that can help you and other in becoming a better person in the future .

Second of all doing community service may not be a choice but look at the things it can get you to. Friend ship is another way of doing community service because while you doing community service you are also helping that person in things they need but was hard too do because of that person not volunteered in helping them. friend ship may be not the easiest thing for some one because of them suppose of being a nerd or something. also there you may find true friend ship because other friends are true in becoming your friend.

Lastly also doing community service can make you set a great leader among yourself. There fore you doing community service would stop you from doing bad things. For example say you afraid to tell your friend in saying no well just tell them i have too go my community service and help others maybe they would laugh but you will feel so good inside of not doing what they had wanted you to do.

To sum this up, rather for you doing something bad you can be doing a great deed for others in the world also there's ain't a lot of kids that are able of going too school but why not you be the one to help them out in that. You would be very proud of you and there fore i promise there parents would to.

Community service. It's what prisoners and volunteers do each and every day. Personally, I don't think you should require us students to do community service. The service takes up what free time we have to do what we need and want to do.

Imagine: kids go to school each day, full of energy, come out tired and hungry, and are then forced to more work even when they don't want too. Doesn't sound like a perfect world, huh? When we get back to our homes from school, a majority of us still have homework left to do, and on top of that, chores. After we finish all that, no other thought of work even worms its way our mind, as we have free time to text, play games, hang out with friends, or just be lazy. Taking this away would result in the failing of many students, as they would be overworked and tired.

Students aren't slaves in any how, which, where, when, or any way. There are those workers out their that could handle a full days' work, but other than that, none. Some, like myself, prefer ""Brains over Brawn"" in many situations. Do brains get tired? Yes, every day, but adjust quickly and form a pattern of it. Our bodies, however, can only take so much punishment. They adjust, yes, but some aren't used to as much work as others, like mowing a 40-acre backyard on a hot summer's day, 10:00 to 1:15. Half would adjust, half would leave. It's a 50/50 shot, willing to pull the trigger?

This is why community service should not be required within each student, only if they volunteer to do so.

People just throw things on the ground and kill our world, by not treating it right. I think we should all be apart of community service. It would help our school raise more money for more activities and we could help other people by making the world better for them. Some people laugh at people doing community service, but what they really should be doing is helping them. They know that doing things for other people, or the community, is the right thing. So i believe that our school should take a full day off, out side, help other people clean up streets, parks, and yards. It would be a lot of help, and even if we don't get paid, we all know we did the right thing. Our world could be a much better place than what it is now. We don't always have to depend on technology to do everything for us. Especially cars, way back people didn't depend on cars, because they weren't even invented, but they had to walk where ever they needed or wanted to go. Whether women were with child, someone had a broken leg, or u could've been sick. Either way, they still kept going until the reached their destination. They couldn't depend on all the technology we have today. Our world could be so much better if we all just stood up and did something nice for a change, like help someone walk their dog or dig up a garden. Maybe help an elder cross the street. You shouldn't expect someone to give cash right away either. Just because you help doesn't mean your lame, or stupid. It means that actually care about the ones around you. So i believe that our school should get up and make a change for once. There should be no more sitting around, doing things we already know, when we could out there, in the world, helping others, learning new things, and how all of this is useful to us.

I think the idea of every kid having to do community service is a great idea. It would help show the kids that by helping your community you are helping out everybody. It also shows the pride and character each student has in their community. If most kids don't help by doing something where they live they usually don't appreciate what they have were they live. Community service is a great way of helping give back what your city or town gives to you everyday.

Many ways you could help give out community service jobs would be to say they were getting something in reward for doing this task. There are many tasks you could give out each week. For example you could give tasks like going around and cutting peoples yards, helping clean up all the litter in the place, or helping repaint an old building or place that has been needing one for a long time.

There are many different things you could get the kids to do to help their community. I encourage that you do make the students do community service. This can help them take more pride in what they do while in school and out of school. It would also make the school look better for encouraging community service. It would help give them more respect from the community. This would also help the whole community look better. It would give them respect from other communities and the state it is in. Getting respect from other places could help your town get new things to. It could help attract more businesses to the community. It could also help the community grow by having more people move to live there bringing new cultures to the community.

There are many things that community service could do for your community. It helps bring new ideas and ways of life, brings more respect, and brings more pride to your town. All these things help your community grow and socialize. They all affect you in many good ways to help everybody.

I think that you should require all of the student body and your self perform community service. I think this because everybody should be willing to help our homes and town. This could help us. first we could get publicity and we will be good neighbors even make friends, Second we could all get active, Third it will help our environment, Last when were helping we could also be having fun.

First, if we all get out there and help I'm sure you will meet a lot of new people. Even make friends also you can make a good reputation for yourself. If we all get together and help eventually you will have tons of friends and partners in life.

Second, Every one complains about weight issues. If everyone got out there and helped work they/you will loose body fat and get muscle. So you would be helping the environment and also get a size 6 waist. Or if your a boy/man you can get the body of your dreams by getting out and helping. This will help the world and help you at getting a date.

Third, Everyone at one point wants to help animals. Well if you/we do community service you/we would be picking up trash and other things. Animals eventually eat trash and choke on it and die painfully. If we got all of the trash up then animals would be not dying for that reason. Also planting trees and flowers will help the environment, animals, and you/us by giving us oxygen and by making soil easier to grow in and by giving animals food and/or places to live.

Last, you could be cleaning out your favorite lake or pond that can be fun if you love the water. Or clean up your favorite place to play outside. I'm sure you at least have one.

I heard that you were deciding whether to require all students to perform some type of community service? Now if it's true then please hear me out,

Community service in my opinion is something that people shouldn't be forced to do. Now community service is a great thing but, still if people don't want to put the time and or effort in to helping then it is a great loss to the community.

Community service should be totally an option anywhere we all can use the help in order to get the best outcome. In schools it is a great thing to do whether or not the school needs it. Like I said all types and forms of community service are great to have and useful to our environment.

Now also I think it to be better to encourage the people to do community service rather than having to require it.

Everyday life people need to step up and take part in the community service also, along with all the kids who already help.

Students should be required to perform community service. Community service makes people a better person in their community. It also shows that we care for the world around us. For example students who are more active in their community are more likely to succeed and change the world. Some actions that students make are good choices and others are bad choices, Community service is a good way to change the environment around us.

Some times in life students don't do things because of their friends and other times they do things because of their friends. Well if a popular student could convince another student to perform community service then that student could convince someone else to perform community service. Spreading the news about community service to everyone around us will forever change the world and how we think about it.

Performing community service is not a right but a privilege. Students should be required to perform community service if their grades are low. Not only if their grades are low, but to show go deeds towards people in the neighborhood, communities, city, and even their state.

Some community service participants have even been awarded because of their good deeds that they chose to do.

Community service should be required for all students no matter how old or young they are. As long as they can make a difference in life then they should be required to perform community service. Community service is not just picking up trash around parks or helping out at nursing homes, but a way of life. Community service tasks vary from person to person. Some people might like to help read to little children or help take care of people with disabilities. Community service shows that you have respect for yourself, the people around you, and show much more.

I heard that you are going to decide whether or not you are going to require students to perform community service.

Well I believe that you should make the kids perform community service to help improve the school and make the school be a better place for kids to come and a safer place to come. I think you should do this because it would give kids something to do and it would improve the education of the students. This would allow students to help learn the virtue of caring and patients because it would require these traits to perform such extraordinary tasks that are given to them. I have some ideas for what you can do for community service around the school.

One of the services that you could have performed is the help of tutoring of lower grade students. An example being that an eighth grader would be required to help a seventh grader with his or her work. Then the seventh grader would help the sixth grader with his or her work. This then would lead to my next point with what a sixth grader can do. they can help the teacher by helping grade papers and figuring what a activity they can do for that class that can be educational. most sixth graders wouldn't have a service to be done from this point so they will help with the other teachers with their work by grading and educational activities this would count for seventh and eighth grade teachers. sixth graders would be chosen for different class for a different hour each day so they can help everyone and then they would just cycle around again.

These were some of the ideas you can use. I hope you will take some of these ideas to account to build a agenda. Well I hope this helped decide what you should do. I also hoped that this will help better and further this school into better recondition for doing good deeds. I hope this helped.

I do not think that community service should be required in school. Even though it is a great way to meet new people and is a very honourable action, some students just do not have the time to do things like that.

We as students are given many projects and a plethora of homework, not to mention studying for tests, to add community service as a requirement would nearly be a crime. Personally I think that community service is a great thing to do, but as a hobby not a requirement. If you where to add community service as a requirement I assure you that a lot of grade A students will be retained for not participating. I alone sometimes feel overwhelmed by the various work assignments that I receive at school, and I usually get an A or a B, but if I had to work community service as well i would become too over worked and start on a steep downward slope in my grades.

If you made community service as a way to get high school credits however, I think that everyone will be very happy. You will get to brag to the school board that your students participate in community service, and the over worked students will be able to do community service when their schedule clears up.

You have now read my argument and resolution, so the final decision is up to you, and I hope that you take what I have written into consideration. Goodbye.

To me community service is a great idea for students to do something good for their future. But like I said others may not have time to do community service.

In order for you to require students to perform an act of community service it is better if you give an announcement during school, or put up a poster around the halls about the idea you have. Better yet ask their parents about the idea and they could talk to their sons / daughters. The plan you have is a good idea but you must find out it the students do community service by checking their permanent records. Then you may ask if they would like to do this.",2,Community service,Independent

I think students should do community service because it is a good thing to do. One thing students can do for the community is to tutor elementary school kids. So then they can be smart in their classes. Another act of community service is help senior citizens in their needs. The students also can pick up litter to help our environment. If every student in our school do this we can make Earth a better place to live on. So i think the you should make our school do community service!

I think everyone should at least do 1 hour of community service. Most people think community service is a waste of time but i think community service could make Earth clean and safer for kids to play. Its very important to do community service because it is active and u don't have to sit on the couch and watch T.V. all day long.",2,Community service,Independent

Community service is the gift that keeps on giving, without it I truly believe without what purpose does man-kind have. I want to take this special opportunity to ask you may we do community service? It would be a great learning experience to the kids. If we do this surely the kids that believe helping is wrong will change their minds.

Everyday, in the world people are corrupted by the following: losing their jobs, a natural disaster may put them out of their homes, and even just a problem with finances. When some of those people lost everything, they literally lost ever thing except for maybe the clothes on their back and the pride that may have been shattered. When kids don't understand now of the possibilities of their future they are at higher risk of them becoming one of those people. This is the main reason why we should help in our community to make it a better place for the follow up generation.

There are lots of things we could do to participate in the community, America, and maybe the whole entire world, baby steps! As middle school children we could have a donation fund at the front office, asking for just a dollar, and if they don't have a dollar, pennies are good to. Then after, we could take it and donate to any shelter that needs it the most. Another idea is, we could just spend an hour a day making our planet clean by helping pick up trash, plant flowers and trees, etc. There are many different projects that we can take on, all together SCHOOL_NAME would truly stand as ""The Best Middle School In The World.""

All students should be required to perform community service. As the human race we must stand together united. If not help the homeless help the community littering problem. If not help the problem help the younger children. If we help the younger kids they may go on in life understanding to help you neighbor.

I believe that it would be good for kids to half to do work. but many kids have activities after school so they may not be able to do this. it should be a choice but not a thing they should have to do. there for i think that kids should not have to do community service because many kids now a days have chores to do at home not ones to do at school to we go to school to learn about skills needed in the real world not to do work for the community sake. i believe that we are at school to learn not to work. this is not just a easy thing to decide on a lot more people should decide on this besides just the principle, this should be up to us the students. not just us are parents as well, and there should be a reward if students do this work. like a treat like ice cream, or a pizza party.

Students should not be forced to do community service, because if they strongly dislike community service work they might resent it when they are older and prevent their children that might like community service to do some work for the community. On the other hand, a child might like the work they are required to do, so I suggest that you gradually encourage students to help the community, but not involuntarily force your students to do community service work.

I have known from some friends that they loathe having to be forced to work for the community. It does not help the school or the place they are volunteering either that the dislike the work, and will do a terrible job or even make the condition of the place worst by misplacing the position of objects or supplies. The group of friends fee that it takes would take up their whole day as they could have done something enjoyable for themselves like going to the mall or trying to finish a project (s)he has procrastinated on and is due very soon.

However, I have had a class discussion on this topic, and most of the answers said were that, service should not be forced on to a person, but rather have a slow buildup to have the student enjoy their work to help improve their community. I, myself have enjoyed helping my school clearing out fallen leaves, or other trash around my school. It gave a feeling of a sense of accomplishment to me.

I have read a book that is more of a extreme conditions for involuntarily servitude, called The House of the Scorpion, it focuses on a boy that is a clone of El Paso, the drug lord. The boy at first is treated like dirt, but as he is found out about that he is the clone of the powerful El Paso the people are forced to serve the boy first treated like dirt. As the book progresses the boy has to leave his home, and runs away to a salt mine, where he is forced to work eatting only plankton. This leaves him to resent the place and ultimately he escapes and goes to the local nunnery where he is reports this place to the Head Nun. The salt mine is quickly shut down and the boy raids the home of the drug lord only to find out that El Paso died so the boy frees all the slaves and shuts it down forever.

I agree with both sides. Requiring community service can positively and negatively affect a student, depending on their grounds of helping others.

The principal should compromise, instead so that the students will not forever hate helping others, but they will have something that will encourage their own kids to do it. Such as, for everyone that completes the minimal amount of hours they have to do the student will be rewarded some sort of prize, like a homework pass or something like a day just for the students so they can have a entertaining day.",3,Community service,Independent

Community service is very important these days. We can help out the community a lot. You should require community service to all of the students. It doesn't have to be a lot but a reasonable amount, about 100 hours of community service is great. The reason that this should be required is because were not just helping the community were helping our world and it's future. If we pick up litter it keeps the Earth healthy. Children should be tutored if that person needs help in school because the students are our future. If the students do poorly then so will the future. The students in elementary school should do good in school as well as middle and high school. Students must do good in school to get into college and make a career or even get a job. Now a days it is very hard to get a job without a high school diploma. The United States was ranked 1st in school academics, we are now ranked in the 20's. The Earth needs to stay healthy because this is the only planet that has life. People should not take this for granite. One day the Earth will not be able to hold life any longer. This is very far away but it will happen. We should keep the Earth healthy so it will hold life longer. Life is an amazing thing so we shouldn't take this for granite. People need to do community service not to help the community but to help bigger things like life and Earth itself. Just by picking up a piece of trash and putting it in a recycling bin can help. The smallest things can help this Earth. Community service is a great thing to do not only can it help but it gives you something to do then just sit around and nothing. It may not be the funnest thing ever but we need to do this for ourselves and the Earth. We should have contests in the homerooms to see who can bring in the most plastics and put it in recycling. We should also come up with ideas that will be fun and community service at the same time. A lot of the students think this will help a lot. People are trying really hard but they can't always do it themselves. People need help to save this Earth. There are so many things to do then just tutor kids or clean up roads. We could plant gardens in front of the school, or on a nice day we could go around the school and pick up things like plastics or bottles. These are just a few ideas. We can't always do this by ourselves. We need a lot of help because the World is too big for one person. Not only are we helping children with homework and picking up trash on the sidewalk but were helping all the animals that can't do this. Once an animal is extinct then the food web or food chain gets all messed up and if that animal that ate that species or plant cant adapt then that animal will die and it will just go on and on and on until there are no animals left and then we won't have anything to eat because there will be no plants or animals to eat. This is why community service should be requires it may seem like a small portion and won't help but every small bag on the sidewalk that gets put in a recycling bin helps.

I think that you should ask the students of our school to volunteer for the work of community service. This is easier because if you make community service a school requirement you will have complaints from the student's parents of making their child work in community service.

The volunteers will actually help you in working with you to help our city be a better cleaner place, or help the people who actually need the help you give to them. For example, the great state of Louisiana still needs help recovering from Hurricane Katrina, maybe you could make that a school field trip for the volunteers at our school to do some community service there. I know I would fell good helping all the parents and children get food, water, fresh clothing, and more.

Another thing you can make a school field trip is, go to Africa to help the people in starvation there, it would help their self concisions to have a full stomach and a full year supply of food and water there to. Yes the flights will be expensive, but I am willing to guess that 2 or 3 of our students, including me, will go with you to help those innocent people.

Another suggestion is just run a fundraiser for all the kids in our school to donate some food or water, canned goods, shirts, shoes, pants, even underwear for these people to use.

Thank you, if you have any questions, please write me back at the return address.

Do people prefer to do community service or play video games? In many ways a person can help other. Some other people prefer to do other things than help. In my opinion , the principal should require all students to do community service. At first it would be a good starting point to help shape teenager's life's. It would also be a good thing because you're helping other people. It can also be a good thing for the people that don't have as many opportunities. You may think that community service is boring and a waist of time, but you will see how helping others can change the world.

Some of the teenagers this days don't care about anyone else but themselves. That will not be good habit for when they grow up. As an adult you cant be sp gritty. A good opportunity to shape or help teenager's life can be real easy. If the principal requires all the students in the middle school then they will be forced t do something good for someone else. As they get use to doing it over and over it will become a habit to help other people.

Not everyone in this world has everything that is needed to have a normal life. By helping a group of elementary you don't only help them have a better education but you also are showing them that helping other people is good thing. There are many ways that you can help people even if it is by taking care of them or giving them food. This people will b thankful for the things you do. And some day in the future they can say that community service is not a waist of time.

Do you know how many people would give anything to have a day as you do? A lot of people in the united states don't have all the privileges as we do. Some of them don't even have a place to stay. If the principal of every middle school requires all the students have to be on community service, then that can be a start of a new world. We can all help by giving clothe, food, covers for beds, blankets etc. If there is one thousand students in every middle school then we can all help the less fortunate. And maybe even help everyone in this world have a normal life like we do.

As mentioned before people don't care enough to help other people. As a whole middle school helps atleast once or twice a week. Then they will get use to helping. This is just a simple why the principal should consider require all the students be on community service. It wont only help the less fortunate but it will also help teenagers with their future. And they can also learn that helping people is not always a waste of time. The principal should not only require students to perform community service but also show that community service is a thing that will always help someone in the world.

It has come to my attention that many students are involved in work such as, sports, academics, and more primarily community service. As a common student of this establishment I think to myself whether it is right or wrong to do community service. In my opinion, community service is like a thank-you to our environment, neighbors, and government, especially in such a hard economic time. Though, as I look at my peers they think community service is something like a ""scandal"", which influences others, such as myself to not go on with these deeds. Why is the world like this? I know it is simply not because community service is bad. I know for sure that is wrong, or is it because people today are too lazy? Or simply scared of criticism? Yet, we as people must give back to our community, not act as if it were to be a burden. Yes, I know times like these are dreadfully hard, with taxes, jobs, and money. Though, I can't help but wonder. What if everyday we woke up with a good feeling, a feeling of empathy for others, our lives, and especially our own community within this fine country? We as the children or America must stand up, ignore criticism and judgement and just do the right thing. As I strongly write this letter, I must ask these questions. Do you think it is necessary to do community service? Do you think it is needed to give back to our communities and just say thank-you? Do you think it is the right thing to do, to love and be proud of our freedom?

This is what I think of community service, and outstanding way of showing our gratitude to our communities. Please think about this and ask yourself this. Do you give back to your community? And if so, please strongly consider to make it a rule for us students to do community service.

Some of my friends think that community service is a great idea, but some of them think it takes up way to much time for them. I think that community service is a great way to keep our planet clean. I think I will join the rest of the elementary schools and tell them the three r rules, which are Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. I can't believe people don't just use this rule. Some people throw there trash on the streets then we have to pick it up. I think its not fair for the rest of us that we have to pick up other peoples trash. Sometimes i think some people are disgusting at the way we treat this world. We should treat it like its our nice house. I also think that people could use the three R' s. If we don't keep up on the community service our family which is the world will fall apart because of the litter. I care for this planet and I hope there's other people out there that care to about this giant family (world). I also hope that you do the same thing that we are doing as well.

I think all students should be required to perform community service. community services should help to teach them responsibility and show them how good it feels inside when you were able to help someone.

Community services can help all students learn responsibility by helping out or taking care of others. For example, if a student had to help out at an animal shelter, they would learn how to take care of animals and the responsibility that comes with it so that when they get their own pet they would know how to take care of it. And if their pet ever gets sick they would know what to do to help that animal.

Spending time on community services can also give you the joy of helping out . I remember a time when i was helping my little cousin with his math homework, and i helped him understand how to do the problems he was so excited he couldn't wait until his mom came home so he could show her that he understood them. It wasn't community service but i loved the feeling of being able to help him understand so he could get better at it and possibly grow up to do something with his life involving the subject that I helped him with.

I think not all students should be required to perform community service, everyday without realizing everybody does something to help people and the environment. I think it's important to help too, but i don't think people should be forced to. Not everyone spends half of their day with community service, but they do spend at least a minute of it without thinking about what they're doing.

I do know it is every important to help people and especially the earth and animals but everyone has their opinion with everything. Maybe we can get a group of people to do a little community service before or after school. I am sure a lot of people would love to help and be apart of a group who does help. Teachers and students could help it will do a lot to help and people could be with their friends also.

I think students should have the opportunity to do community service, but they shouldn't have to do it.

One reason I think community service shouldn't be required is because some students may play sports or be in a club or group and not have any time between school and their extracurricular activity to work in the community.

Also if you make community service required many students may spend so much time on their community service they may lose the passion for the sport they enjoy so much.

Also the students that already do community service may do it for fun or they enjoy helping others, but they may not enjoy it if they are forced to do it.

Personally i don't enjoy community service but I still do it by helping the elderly by fixing up their porches or building a ramp for them if they are confined to a wheelchair.

Although I enjoy it I don't want to be made to do it.

I also think many people that do community service enjoy being with people and being social or environmentally friendly.

I know I am more of a social person so I like working for people that I can talk to about things they like to do and stuff I do.

also if you make people perform community service many students grades may go down because they are focusing on their community service time than their grades.

The principal is trying to decide if the school should require community service in your school. The principal at our school should require to have community service for many reasons. This is just some of the many reasons; in many collages they look for if you did community service, it help the community out a lot, and it will help you learn how to work hard, and meet new people.

First, many collages look to see if you have done any community service. If you do community service it could help you get into collages easier than with out. The collages will tell that you care about your community. It also shows that you know how to work. Having done community service or not could get you into the collage you want to get into.

Now, community service can and will help your community. If you help in a road side clean up it would make your community a nice place to be. It can also bring people in to the companies in you town or community. Community service can be a big thing.

Next, how it will help you. community service can help you in many ways. There are some ways; it can help you learn how to work hard and meet new people. Learning how to work hard will help you a lot when you try to get a job and other tings.

In conclusion community service is a great thing to do it will also help you in the long run.

Dear Principal,

Throughout the United States of America, pollution, homeless people, and many more everyday conflicts that can be modified and diminished are faced in nearly every city and town. If there is a way to reconstruct the society of our country, then why not do it? Well is would be an outstanding achievement, but it would require a lot of time and work. Therefore, it would cut time from sports, education, music, and spending time with friends and family. In this case I believe that students should not be forced into community service to help make our nation a better place.

To start this idea off, many students are already lugging themselves to help form a better civilization. The United States is not a catastrophe, and many other countries have corrupt governments and humans living on streets and in their cars. I believe that the nation's idea of setting up homes for our citizens is already an enhancement for our magnificent nation. Many adults rather are looking for jobs in our nation. Perhaps, if adults were payed for their labor, it would increase employment rate and make our kingdom a better place to live.

Students who are willing to perform in community services should definitely have the privileges to do as they wish. For example, I play tennis three to four times a week, play golf, play the piano, the drums, and know French. I perform these activities, not only for my pleasure, but also to make a nice beginning for my near future. I also am a member of the California Junior Scholarship Federation. I help our society in dealing with people in need, cleaning up our environment, and much more. If I were to take some time off from my activities and put time into helping our community, it would make this world a better place, but it would also clip the ends off of my goals.

All in all, they are definitely many conflicts that people in America face daily, but once again, other areas in our world face conflicts that are mush major. To my opinion, students should not be forced to do community service.",3,Community service,Independent

I think students should not perform community service because it would seem like they were getting punished for something they didn't do. Doing community service would take too much time from doing school work students rely need. If students decide to clean up the community then they should be able to do it. If a student were to do something to brake the rules then they should be sentenced community service as a punishment depending on there crime. for example if a student were to start a fight the student should do a number amount of hours doing community servis. The students that chose to clean their community should be provided the tools to do the job because they don't have to do anything and some kids cant afford to do so. for example if a student needs a tool the city should provide it. I think if the student wont to do it then they should do it and get offered to get paid for it because nobody would wont to give up their free time for free.

I think community service is a good way too keep kids out of trouble. For example if a student that was supposed to do community service went with his/her friends instead.

And later got caught for stealing something from a local store and got arrested by the police. That student could have gone to the community service and get a chance to stay out of trouble and at the same time, help the community. Another example is, these student's that are doing community service will have no problem working in the future. My final example on why students should do community service is, so in the future you can say that you did something for your community and your community will remember what you did and not because you had to do it , but because you wanted to do it ,and that makes you a better person no matter what.",2,Community service,Independent
193B0EE3BF45,"Dear Principal,

Community service should not be required by all students. Although community service is a wonderful thing, service should never be forced. I think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it and because maybe someone's life really is too busy for it.

Forcing someone to do service defeats the point of it. When you are serving others you are doing it to be kind, but if you had no option then you're doing it for no reason. People are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren't as thankful if they know that serving them wasn't the persons option, and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn't have done it.

Teenagers don't like it when they are told what to do. It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.

Another reason community service shouldn't be required is because someone might not have time. If they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day, then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service. Also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades. And if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship, but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college. Another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports. They would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship.

Therefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it.

I think your decision on whether all students on doing community service should be a yes. I think this because everywhere you go is always so dirty and community service won't hurt anyone, it will actually help someone.

Everybody needs to know that our world needs to get better and cleaner. Littering is probably the worst thing out there that you can do. Something needs to change because when you just walk outside of your house there's a piece of trash and you can help by just picking that piece up. If you could get all the students doing community service then those students could inspire other students or even their brothers, sisters or even their own parents. If just one person could help pick up a little trash then imagine what ten or even fifty people could do this world would be better in no time if everybody could just pitch in a little of there time everyday by making the world a little better.

I have heard that you are considering to require all students to perform community service. To be honest I think it's a great idea. But some students don't think it will be. But there is a large variety of things you can do for community service. For example, there is cleaning up litter, tutoring, cleaning other peoples yard, and a whole bunch of stuff.

I think the one that is well liked by students is tutoring younger kids. It's actually a lot of fun! It actually makes you feel like you are a teacher. The younger kids will ask you a lot of questions about how to do their homework. But most of the time they catch on to it pretty quickly. Of course you will think that their stuff is easy. But remember, you more than likely had the same problems when you were their age. If students like tutoring other students, they will probably encourage other students to consider students for tutoring. Then maybe the principle will consider making it an elective for the school. Of course it won't be mandatory but it could be for students that enjoy tutoring younger students in a lower grade level. By my opinion, it's probably the most enjoyed by students than doing other stuff.

Most students enjoy cleaning up their environment. For example, they clean up litter, pick up after pets, and growing trees and planting flowers. Some students get straight to it right after school. But most of the time students do it on their free time. I say free time because they probably have electives after school or play sports. Most students play sports after school to get a scholarship for a college they want to attend. Their practice only lasts for an hour or two. The best thing about community service and playing sports is that you have a lot of time to clean up your environment. Instead of cleaning up the environment, kids like to plant flowers and trees. I say the easiest thing to grow is flowers. Trees take longer to grow a full height then flowers take a couple of days. Trees take months or years to grow! Besides flowers come in a variety and you can choose what you want to grow. Trees grow into whatever they want to.

The last thing kids might interested to is cleaning up neighbors yards. Some people pay the kid like 5 dollars but some people don't pay them at all. It doesn't really matter if you get paid or not. You are doing a nice thing for your neighbor. He or she should appreciate that. Sometimes you just have to mow the lawn or pick up trash. So it's not really that complicated to clean up someone's yard. Well i guess it depends on how big the lawn is. If it's huge, then it wouldn't be hard to pick up trash but if your mowing the lawn, it might take you some time to finish. But on a good note, you did something nice for someone. They probably can't do it because they could be injured or something.

Those are a couple of things you should consider doing for the school.",4,Community service,Independent

I personally think that students are to be required to do community service. It helps the community and everyone in it. It helps them care for others and their feelings. They should also do community service to let them know that helping others is better than helping themselves. Also, one last fact is that colleges look for children that have done a lot of community service.

They will help the community and the people in it by them giving food or shelter to the hungry or the homeless. They learn also that they are not the only ones and be nice and generous to others. They will learn that the needy really need help, especially during winter and tough times like now. This is one reason they need to do community service.

Another reason to require community service is that they will learn to care for others and their feelings. When they know that they are not the only ones and that they are more fortunate than a lot of others than they will learn this. The children usually get selfish if they don't know how many people are less fortunate than they are. This the second reason for them to do community service.

Another reason for doing community service is that they will learn to help others more than helping themselves. They get selfish if they think that nobody needs that thing they want, so they will take more and if there is someone needy, they lost that thing they wanted. In addition to becoming selfish, they will lose the ability to respect people that went through things that the children probably couldn't like the concentration camps, and live to tell what happened. This was yet another reason for children to do community service.

My last reason to do community service is that colleges look for the children that have completed a lot of community service hours. A lot more colleges are giving scholarships and even just recognizing people that have done community service, voluntarily. That is my last reason for children to do community service.

Children will regret it when they grow up if they did not partake in community service. They will lose the ability to respect others as much, they will not care for others and they will not help the community. I want to make one last plead to make the children do community service as a requirement of the school.

EF2D45E53F40,I think that they should only do that if they want to because you should not be forced to do any thing. But i think if they got in a fight or just a bad kid I would agree that they should do community service on school grounds because OSS is just happy for those kids and they are fine with that. If we are talking about kids who are good in school and they pick up after them self then I would say that it should be an option if somebody does not want to help because you do not know what they do when they get home i know that the younger kids in k through 5 have to have somebody their when they get off the bus so that's why I think the principle has any right to tell a kid that they have to do community service when they have done nothing wrong. How would the principle feel if the board of ed called him and said that he has to clean all the toilets before he goes hone and he's got 3 kids then he cant get home. So I think that it is not fair at all for the principle to tell the students what they have to do. I think that it is great they want to help but everyone should not be told what to do like i under stand if it is our parents because they are feeding us housing us and also clothing us when they say pick the trash up an all of the other stuff. But a principle someone that you do not even know that well tells you what to do when they don't do that much for you that is the only reason i would have to agree with the students if you are busy then that is fine but if you do want to help that is also great for you but i don't agree with what the principle is saying and i think that he should just say no and not even have to think about it for a second they are kids not adults and i think that would be consider a physical punishment because you could get injured and you never know what might happen. If they are a bad kid why would you leave them their alone and you would have to pay a teacher extra to stay their longer. So that is what i think about this whole thing.,2,Community service,Independent
EDE56797770A,"Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that people shouldn't have to do community service unless they get into legal trouble such as a fight, and they are charged with assault. Or if someone steals something and they are charged with stealing.

I think that as long as someone does what he is supposed to do then it is okay that they don't have to do community service. Like how would you feel if someone just put a task in front of you without your permission, when you could be studying, or exercising to prevent not being fat like this country is now, and not being dumb like most of the country is. So i say that we should really be doing things that can help ourselves and do community service whenever we want. Because if you force someone to do something, we wont like it. So if you make people do community service nobody will do it. We will just say we did it even though we didn't. And tree huggers, AKA environmentalists

Anyway they are obsessed with the earth but what they don't get is that big companies are starting to fund research to find greener ways to help the environment so that we can run on electricity. We shouldn't do it because we are kids and we don't have to go and pick up trash in the middle of the road where cars are coming and trucks can hit us. And the government is already slowly demolishing our freedoms to save the little fishies that swim in gutters. They live on algae and stuff so why ban phosphates in dishwasher detergent, or get rid of mercury in light bulbs and have the green light bulbs which shine too bright or too dull. So the government really shouldn't take our rights away. So i say if they are doing something about it we shouldn't have to worry about it. So Elementary kids can learn by their teachers. Why in the heck do kids that learn how to spell need tutoring? Their teacher should teach them, or their guardians or whoever the heck they live with tutor them, why don't they help the kids and not us, when sometimes we mess up on the stuff too. Why cant we go do something with our lives because we make our lives. We don't need anyone else to control them. So don't force us to do something we don't want to do, or buy something we don't want to buy, or force us to not buy something so we eat with dirty dishes.

WE LIVE ON THIS PLANET TOO!!!

And Lord help us all when the world ends, because by the looks of it, we don't have the time to do everything we need to because we are fat and dumb. So if you make us do community service we will not do good in school because we are too tired to do anything. If you put in a sleep time that would be nice though. Because I remember in pre-k no-one wanted to sleep, and now i want to sleep every period and I'm in 8th grade. So seriously, please switch that around.

I think students shouldn't be required to community service simply because we have other things to do in our life's besides community service. It would possible take up personal time that we could have used to do something else like do a project. Wouldn't you be angry if u was required to do something that was a waste of time. Community service could effect us dramatically academic wise. We could be so tired that we fall a sleep in class. Could we learn this way? No! Requiring community service wouldn't be necessary. Students shouldn't have to perform this task at all if there isn't a logical explanation behind it. Lets just say one day a student has a band practice or any other school activity and doesn't get time to practice because they had to do community service. So the concert comes up and the student couldn't play there part right so it sounds horrible. How would you feel if a weight like that was on your shoulders?

I think that all students should be required to perform community service. Some example or reasons that I think that students should be required to perform community service is that helping the world using community service is great. This will help the environment and help the world. This is why I think that this will help the environment and the world. This is because this will help the world not be a nasty world. This will also help clean up litters and help recycle to reduce killing animals, and polluting the world. Another reason why is that this will help what you can do when you have nothing else to do. This will be great if everyone can help each other to make the world a better place. My last reason why is that doing this can also reduce people from littering and other things because they will see how bad it will be if we didn't do this community service.

To make some one do something is to make them hate it, to incourage some one to do some thing is to make a posibility. community service shouldn't be about punishment it should be about helping out without getting money or rewarded, because in the end it helps us all financualy and community wise but offcourse you don't have people jumping up and down for it and because of the simple fact as its not looked as helping out our community its looked as a singh of punishment and allways have been. people have no problem avoiding something especialy when it comes to work. so why not try to explain how it will help us and benefit our needs for the future.

Also for all the struggling younger kids it would be nice to have some one alittle older with alittle bit more experience to help them out on tough assignments so that in the future they can say they know how to do it and the person that taught them how can be proud to show some of his or her intelligent to others.

I think community service is a great thing to have required by all students, it will help the world and all of the people in it to be kinder.

With using community service it doesn't have to be boring many ideas the students may enjoy; including cleaning up litter, helping nursing homes or pet services.

Doing the service doesn't have to take up too much of the time for what you want to do or what you need to do.

It can be done quickly and easily with help and also if you enjoy it, it wont be as time consuming or a drag.

not only will doing community service be helpful it will also make a good impression and make others happy or thankful for it.

for example, just by doing a little amount of litter pick up can make others decide to do it and then the whole world could become a much cleaner place over time.

If you help a nursing home you can help by giving the people company, help cleaning, and make the employees jobs a little less stressful. With one person helping to change the world it will make it better one step at a time.

No matter if someone says they hate it or not I think is something out there for everyone.

This concludes that I agree with community service being required and think it should be required for all of our students, no matter a persons age or their abilities.

I am writing a letter to you to explain why we should perform community service. Here are three reasons why we should perform community service. One is that it makes our community look better. Second is that it can teach us some responsibility's. third is that if we do community service it will keep us out of trouble and become better people.

First, is that we should do community service our community will look better. It will look better because we will pick up the trash in our community. If we pick up trash we will have more visitors. When we perform community service it makes us look clean and not like trashy people. If we did one hour of community service a day we could get a lot of stuff done like cleaning up trash cutting grass around the area and making sure everything is nice and clean. Truly community service would make our community a better looking place.

second, community service would teach us several responsibility 's. It would teach us responsibility's such as we got to keep our area clean. When we do what we are told things will go much easier. It will also teach us that we got to do what's best for our community and it will make us better people by helping out the community. All in all community service will teach us some responsibility's that we will need in life to go farther in life.

Third, community service will keep us out of trouble. It will keep us out of trouble because it will give us things to do and stay busy. Community service gives us great responsibility's in life. We get it trouble when we have nothing to do and we trying to start stuff to get everybody mad. When we perform community service we don't get in trouble because we are not bored and we are not trying to start stuff.

In conclusion community service will keep us out of trouble cause it will keep us busy

All in all community service gives us gives us good reason to want to perform it. It makes our community look better and it teaches us great responsibility's. Community service also keeps us out of trouble it does this because it keeps us busy. Community service is great for our community for these reasons.",4,Community service,Independent

I think you should make a mandatory 8 hours of community service for students because it is important for students to help out around their neighborhood it boosts self confidence and it helps student appear to be good caring people instead of horrible children that don't care about anyone but themselves. Also it makes your community more different, it wont look any old community it'll be a community where people care about one another and do things for others. They're many organizations like the red cross that help out other communities for doing good things. People like it when they see that students are helping out around the community it shows that they care about others. Also students enjoy talking so why not let them talk to others about their community and what is going on around them.

Many students like to help out but they don't do it a lot because they don't get rewarded for so give them something in return for their good deeds . Give them a free A for every five that they help out around the community. i STUDENT_NAME",2,Community service,Independent

I feel that it is not mandatory for students to perform community service.

The kids who do it most likely want to get into an impeccable collage, or just help out in the community.

Personally, I don't have much time to dedicate myself to it, since I'm extremely busy with perfecting my homework.

I also have other out-of-school activities like music, but sometimes when I'm not doing work, I need to take a break and spend some time with friends or playing.

If it were required to do community service, many students wouldn't have the time to do it, and some might not even be fit for the job!

Already, many kids have homework and with community service to top it off, they would be all worn out, and probably schools would have kids falling asleep in class.

The teachers wouldn't be too pleased with those results!

Some students may not be very good with helping people, they could be more of a scientist than a social worker.

They should work on social skills, but they should do this in other ways.

Someone may get their feelings hurt when the student tries to do community service, if they aren't compatible with others.

If you feel strongly about kids doing community service, I suggest making a presentation about it, to show kids how it is like, so maybe more will be willing to do it.

Or for one day, the whole school could participate in community service activity.

This would give kids a chance to learn more about it and give them a chance to see what it would be like.

Or the students could help at a soup kitchen or tutor younger children in elementary school. It would be better for the younger children so they can get a better education and succeed. At the soup kitchen, students could serve meals to homeless people and the less fortunate.

I support your idea for having kids do community service. I think we could all really help the community by doing these tasks like helping the elderly or cleaning up if we tried. I don't think that some students would appreciate having to do these things, though. Some kids enjoy just staying at home or hanging out with friends and don't realize that they should help their community or even the world! Kids don't realize how much of an impact they could have on their community.

I feel like requiring community service for all kids would help them realize that they could make a positive change and they may even enjoy themselves. But that really only goes for some kids. Some kids don't want to help. Some kids believe that it could ruin their plans or it could ruin their 'reputation'. I don't think they realize how positive community service is. Community service can help build a person's character and get a better understanding of the world. It can help them realize how bad the world is and how much help it really needs or how bad some people have it. I don't think kids understand this. They must think it's some big joke.

Perhaps you shouldn't require it. Perhaps you should just start a community service group that cleans up litter in parks or around the school, or they can help raise money for the poor or do canned food drives or auctions. Community service isn't necessarily going out there and doing something big to help someone. The group can do a bunch of little tasks such as volunteer at a soup kitchen or bring food to the homeless. Everything makes a difference. And if not many people join the group, then that's fine, forcing someone to do something won't mean they'll enjoy it or do a good job at it. All that matters is that some kids want to help the community and that your school helps them do that. It would look good for the school and for the kids, as well. This can be a very positive change in the community's atmosphere.

I don't believe that these kids don't want to help, I just don't think that they understand how much they are able to do or how big an impact they can make. Maybe it is your job to help them realize that, maybe you can help them realize that after all.",4,Community service,Independent

The question - Should all students be required to perform community service? - has arisen. Although these acts of service strengthen our community, their demand should be illegitimate. Requesting community service would take needed time for studying away from those who find their courses more challenging, and denounce the notability of these acts.

Because certain students need a considerable amount of time to be devoted to their school work in able to understand the information they are taught, community service should not be required of the students. Imagine yourself in the position of a young student who has little time to spend with their friends or participate in out-of-school activities, because the majority of their time is devoted to schoolwork. In turn, in order to meet the amount of community service due in the allotted time, they are forced to spend less time in other subjects, consequentially lowering their grade in the class. The resulting situation is that the services aimed to better the community have degraded the student's regime.

Requiring students to perform acts of community service would take away the notability of these selfless acts and decrease their meaning. Participating in community service is a charitable act, that is meant to bring happy and fulfilling feelings to its participants. Requiring these acts would require students to do something they should already do from the goodness of their hearts. If they did this just for a letter grade, it would take away the much appreciated meaning.

As you can see, it would be to the benefit of few to request hours of community service from the students at this school. Doing so would decrease their meaning, as well as cause the grades and free time of more needful students to suffer. I hope you will take my words to mind and make the better decision: not requesting community service from my peers and myself, but, rather, encouraging it.

Some students perform community service. Some tutor elementary students and others clean up litter. They take this task seriously. However, many other students who do not wish to partake have the perspective that community service is time consuming, and unnecessary to complete. For this reason, I do not believe that community service should be mandatory and required. For example, many students feel that this duty will take away their privilege to get what they need and what they want to do. For the unwilling students, I think making community service mandatory will also effect their work performance in school, since all their time would be invested into this service and not into their studies. However, for the willing individuals who insist in participating community service, they have their own choice and judgement to join or not, therefore the decision was none other than their own.

For example I have to walk home therefore when I get there its already 4 o'clock. then it take me 1 hour to do my homework. Then I go to practice and thats 2 hours and it takes me a good 30 minutes to get home. When I get home it time for me to get in the shower and go to bed.

YES.! I feel that all kids should do community service.! I feel this need because it takes up time and it also helps our community. I think that the principal should make all students in the high and elementary schools do community service. Just think about it, if every student in the schools did this, we would never have to worry about tutors, baby sitters, or even trash pickers, and many other helpful things. Also i feel that we all help put the trash down, so why not help pick a little up every now an then. I mean it's not that hard. The principal, board of education, or even the police ,should all help us to keep OUR environment clean as well. THINK ABOUT IT.! (you do not want people to come in GORDO, or any other town and see a whole bunch of garbage thrown on the ground.) Also I'm sure you would not want to go through the schools files and see a whole bunch of bad grades, when you could tutor the ones younger than you that need help.!

A few reasons are students like to do other activities after school, students may not have a way to get to the place where the community service is, and it may make students mad and make them not like school.

First of all is students like to do things after school. Some may have sports or want to hangout with friends. Or parents may want to spend family time with them.

Second is students may not have a transportation to get to the place where the community service is. They may not be old enough to drive, or there parents may still be at work when they arrive home from school.

Third is students may be upset that the school is forcing this upon them. This could cause them to not like school and want to skip it. Which would help at all.

I think student should be able to help do community service because, we should keep out community clean and help out people that is in need. Its an good idea to help out our community cause without our help our community would look trashy and dirty, for example the side walk is always fell with trash, help keep it clean by bringing people along and clean it up am sure that will make them have something to do. People will think that we don't take care of our community like we should if we don't.

Another reason why i think students should help out our community is because many people don't have homes to go to and we need to help them out by for instant donating food for the food pantry, donating old clothes that you don't need, and more. We need to keep our community looking good and experience.

Helping our community will make you feel good about your self and helping somebody out will make you feel like you have achieve something in life. From my experience helping your community will make you a better person in life and you could feel that you have done something important for your community.

Finally students should be able to help our community out cause it will help them in school by bring their grades up or by getting an award from your principal. So don't waste time playing and goofing around when somebody is in need, go a head an help them out am sure they will feel thankful that you have done something.

Some students prefer to participate in community service whilst others believe that it is a waste of time. I believe giving back to the community is a great way for students to show their care and love for the town they live in. I also believe that students should be required to perform community service. Community service is a great way for students to give back to their city or town they lived in since they were young, it teaches students lessons that can be later on in life, and it can provide students with a great, fun opportunity to meet new friends and make our world a better place. Community service is a great way for students to learn positive values and teach them new lessons. The real question is why wouldn't students want to participate in a community service project?

Community service is a great way for students to give back to the town that had supported them for their lives. Whether it is sweeping trash off of the streets, cleaning up a local garden, or visiting with people in a retirement home or hospital, community service is a great way to show that students care. Although these tasks are laborious, most students do not realize how beneficial it can be to make their town a better place. Most people greatly appreciate work that has been done to help the community and sometimes reward those who did their share. There is nothing like the feeling of satisfaction after finishing a good deed. It doesn't just make the person themselves feel good, but it also makes the whole community feel good!

Community service also teaches students very important life lessons. When performing service in a soup kitchen, students learn the value of life and begin to understand that there are people whom are less fortunate than themselves. This kind of community service teaches children to appreciate the things they have in life and teaches students to be less selfish. It also shows that it is important to help those is need, to reach out a helping hand, and send a positive message. Community service also teaches students discipline and teamwork, two things that are required in adult life. Some students do not understand how to work well with others or trust other students. When performing community service, these lessons are learned and students can become better prepared for their adult careers. Not only does community service make the world a better place, it teaches students and participants to a be a better person themselves.

Another reason why community service should be required for students is the fact that it is a fun opportunity for students to do their part to help the community. Most service projects are worked on in groups of people. When working with others, not only does it build teamwork skills but also gives students the chance to make new friends. Some students may not have that many friends, but after participating in a service project, new friends are bound to be made. Most students also believe that community service is a hard, laborious task when in reality it is a fun, active way to spend your afternoon or weekend. Most service projects are placed in fun, active environments where working isn't considered working at all! Community service is a great way to show students that working doesn't always have to be boring and hard.

As you can see, community service should be completed by all students. Students will learn that community service isn't just a hard, boring task to be completed but a fun way to give back to the community. Community service is a great way for students to give back to their town or city, learn important life lessons, and have fun while doing their part to help the community. Many students believe that students community service is a waste of time but I believe otherwise. These are my reasons why I believe that students should be required to perform community service.

I think that the community service should be an option for students. It is not fair to take time out of there lives. For example some students have sports or activities and don't have time for it. Some students enjoy spending time with there friends and family if they do community service they might not have enough time for any of that.

When a student does community service it might make them tired and not able to study for things like tests so their grades could go down. If a student cant keep there grade up there parents might make them stop community service. Sometimes if a student does not full fill there work they stay up late and might miss school. For students that can handle doing more things they could do community service. But for other students it could be hard on them.

If students are required to do it they might slack off on other things and might fall asleep in class because they have not been able to sleep maybe because of stress. when a student is stressed they cant work if they cant work then they could fail. When you think of community service you think of the time that's being taken from you. So most students don't like to do the community service. But some of them have the time to do so and decide that they want to.

student who do community service could have good grades and are able to take time to do things. but for the students who are failing or struggling could really use the time to study or maybe extra credit work. When a student has good grades there parents let them do things but if they have to do community service it doesn't help there plans with friends or family they have not seen in a while. I've heard that doing community service could get you more credits in school that you need to pass. But it also takes away the fun that some people can have. Thank you for taking time to read this letter and i hope that you will make the right choice.

I think it is a big thing to help with our community to help keep it clean and to help keep are community smart , it would not be bad to make everybody to do community service because everyone needs to know how to do that and to make a difference in our lives and communities i think it would be great to do that and im glad for people that have already done it and i think it would be a big help with people that are not a good learner like needs help and stuff i think that it would be great for that too. i would help in so many ways and i think if it is just our school then so be cause that just shows we are trying to help our community in different ways. or if it happens where we cant do it i think it should be a punishment for the kids that do get in trouble. and yes i understand where it takes a lot of there time well if they just did it for just an hour or 30 min. that would be great. cause 30 min is a lot of time to help but i was just going to tell you i think it is a great idea even if some people don't like the idea i still think you should do it or you should do it for punishment so that they would not get in trouble no more especially if they don't like doing that. so i thought i would just give you my opinion this and to tell you it is not a bad idea it is a good idea.

CC41AE0A268E,"I think that it would be a great idea for students to do community service. It keeps the town looking nicer, people are happier, and if people see others doing community service, they just might help out as well.

If we had people doing community service it would make our town/community much cleaner. Like when people pick up litter. I know I hate seeing broken bottles and wrappers on the sidewalk. Or cleaner water. We wouldn't have to see chemicals in our once beautiful streams. Lastly, overgrown lawns. It is just disgusting to see someone's house being untreated like that.

I think people would be much happier if we had people doing community service. Like elderly homes. I'm sure some of the residents there wouldn't mind having visitors once in awhile. Town citizens would very much appreciate help. Like extra help at the library. Also, don't forget your parents. They would be so proud to have a son/daughter who does some volunteer work.

Lastly, if people see that people are doing community service, it might just influence them to do a little too. Like if someone works at the library. A person might actually say ""Wow. They are making a lot of new friends here. Or if someone is cleaning a pond and a person sees them. They might say, "" That pond is looking really nice, maybe I'll help too."" Also, if a person is doing some yard work, a pedestrian walking by might see. They could say, "" That owner of the house looks very happy. I should make a difference like that too.""

In conclusion, I believe that it would be an awesome idea to have students doing community service. Our town would look much nicer, it would make people enjoy themselves a little more, and , hey, you never know. Someone might just walk by and say,"" That person is making a huge difference. Maybe I'll do some volunteering myself.""",4,Community service,Independent
F3B22F37C39E,"Has someone ever made you do something you don't want or need to do? Its not fair if someone would make you do something that is not necessary. I think that the principle should not make you do something you don't want to do. Maybe you have other things to do , like play sports or babysit. Not everyone is always free to do something that is assigned. Some people are maybe just to lazy to do community service, but you never know that.

The principle should just let the children decide whether they want to perform community service. Maybe the children's parents would not like for there kid to do community service. Witch would mean that out of all the other kids at school their the only one not doing it. That wouldn't be fair for all the other kids, and they would most likely stop doing the community service that they were assigned. They would just ditch. Witch would lead to many kids to not doing what they were supposed to do. And eventually all the kids that ditched would end up getting in trouble.

Some children might need to study for tests, which would not give them time to do the community service. There are many different reasons why children cannot perform community service.

I think community service would be wonderful for anyone to do. Community service could really come in handy one day, it could also be fun. There are a lot of reason why I think we should all do community service but I'm only going to name three. The first reason why i think we should take community service is because its very nice, it helps others out with some stuff and also it makes you feel better about yourself. So lets turn this around and get to talking!

Being nice to someone is always the right thing to do, nobody really knows how much that means to someone else if you just do one little nice thing. Community service is always about being nice some of the students thinks its a waste of time, but they don't know what it is until they actually see the peoples faces when we be nice and jump out of our way to make them happy. Its amazing how one person can actually do that.

Helping out others could really be a drag sometimes but when the work is done it looks a lot better. This world would be a lot of a better place if people would just help each other with some little things. For an example: Some lady is getting very old and she needs someone to cut her grass every week. Someone could be so nice enough and just go cut the grass for free and see how she's doing. Helping others and being nice is all in the same concept. We all need to just do it maybe for a week. Trust me if people would realize how much we can help in this world I think we all could do it !

Community service is not only good for them its also good for yourself. Doesn't everyone love the feeling that your a hero ? Well if everyone did a little bit of community service everyone would be a hero everyday! Feeling good about yourself is the best thing about life. But making someone else happy is amazing. Nobody understands how community service could help them but its not only about helping them its about doing the right thing and helping others. Be good to yourself and make yourself proud for once go out and help others.

Its all three in one being nice, helping others and making yourself feel good. And I would truly love to do that with people if you Mr. Principal would allow every student to do so. Its all called common curtsy. Not most people have what we have so if we cleaned, did jobs, painted. Whatever made someone else happy I think I could persuade every other students to help also.

Community service, you want children to do community service my opinion for that is they should in some way and in another they shouldn't .

Opinion one in some way the children should help out picking up trash and help with other things grownups cant do it all the time .Sometimes they need help so you should get involved and help out every once in awhile.

Opinion two in some way children should not help out .You have too think children need every minute of their life with education . This cant be during our time of learning that help us when we get older. Children shouldn't do community service not in till they get little bit older . Time is money and money is in our education to go to college and be successful in our everyday lives.

My point is think about what you put off make the right decision see where the children are if they have extra time they could it after school . Otherwise do what's best for you.

I feel community service should be required.

Community service is required at the high school so why not start now?

Giving back to the community looks and is great on college applications, and community service can help decide what kids want to do in life.

Also, by performing community service kids can turn into model citizens.

SCHOOL_NAME requires their students to get so many community service hours to graduate.

Well, when some kids go to high school they have no experience in this area.

By making community service a requirement, students will get a head start on a way to prepare for their future. Also, this can mold students into model citizens.

Colleges are always looking for extra clubs and acclivities on applications.

Community service is a great thing on college applications.

Giving back helps colleges decide if they want you as part of their community or not.

If you have a long history of community service colleges will appreciate it more!

People are always saying that they want to be the president, or a professional sports star.

Some community service involves things like tutoring and coaching little league baseball, so you get to do what you love and give back.

Take me for example, my community service was coaching boys and girls club volleyball.

I loved what i was doing and I gave back.

TEACHER_NAME, helping the community is a great way to prepare for high school, contribute to kids college applications, and to do what you love but at the same time giving back . Please, require community service.

E1B4C22E7785,"Dear Principal,

We have been hearing quite a lot about the subject of doing community service lately and my classmates have chosen me to write you this letter about what we think you should do and some reasons as to why you should. As we all know, community service is a lot of work, but it is also worth the work because we get a better town and community.

Community service is a very important matter in which I believe everyone should be involved. Whether it is cleaning a local park or helping other students, it is a very egregious activity for the community. It would also attract good attention to the school and promote other schools to do the same.

Community service is utterly important, not just to keep the town clean, but also to promote good habits and motivate students to help their neighborhoods or wherever they get in life. Some ideas for services include; trash pickup, school cleaning(bathrooms, trash, classrooms, etc.), and low cost field trips to places that are in dire need of cleaning.

If we did such services the school would get a good reputation and possibly more students, which leads to more funds, which leads to a better school. And if we got other schools involved in the movement we would have more help and a better community.

Just think, community service is a win for everyone. It keeps the community clean, the people happy, and the students learning good habits. They could make new friends, and we could have a more united, friendly, and most of all CLEAN setting for our future generations.

Thank you for your time and I strongly hope you consider this proposition.

0483125DCD62,"Most people you see cleaning up the community are people who have gone to jail or there told they would have to clean to do community service. Doing community service will not only help out the environment, but it helps out with the community as well.

Every kid would not want to spend there day cleaning the community, they would rather stay at home and do nothing, but not all kids are like that. Those other kids would rather help out our community than have litter everywhere an live in a garbage dump. I think it would be better if kids did help out an clean because it will give them an opportunity to give back to the community an do something right for a change. Kids who do get into trouble, this can help them to stay out of all that trouble. Cleaning up will also look good for the community, it will look more attracting and would make people want to go there. It would also help with the pollution.

Telling kids at a young age to pick up trash can help prevent this. Even though kids would rather not do community service, I think it would be good for them. Doing so, this would help the kids stay out of trouble and keep people knowing that they live in a clean community an we still have some kids helping out the community.",2,Community service,Independent

I think us students shouldn't perform community service.

But for those people who wants to help community should. Not all students have time to do community service because of their after school activities, even though they want to. Some students doesn't want to do community service because they don't think that it isn't very important. For those who want to should sign up and for those who doesn't want to do it should give a different task.

Some students, like me have after school activities. But doesn't find time to help the community to do so. I think having students community service is a great idea but some people just don't find the time. So I'm thinking that for those who want to, should just give donation, or the school should have a field trip making all the students do community service. So everyone helps the community.

For those people who doesn't want to do community service should be a given a task that involves the community. Like having students help around school, helping the teachers or cleaning around school, or go around or ask their family to donate money for a community. Simple things help the community in little ways. By just picking up trash looks a little different, but it is a big help.

For those students who has time to help should sign up for after school, or during school activities, like go to elementary school and teach children how to read, or count. Some people could help the mailman deliver mail to people so the mailman doesn't have to go around a lot.

Students could gather around the park and clean up, also help those elders who needed help.

Others could help the librarian to put the books in the right places. Have students do a car wash to help support school supplies, so each students in the school don't have to share supplies.

Most kids never consider a life outside of their own, most believe that if they see something on T.V. that it's just another show, they may understand it may be true but they don't feel the same pain or hurt as the crying mother on the flickering screen before them. All students should be required to do at least 10 hours of community service every quarter. Think of how much a difference it would make, if everyone worked together.

Most people argue it's not technically community service if the deed is not by their own will, but does it have to be? All I am asking is that students help with their community so they can understand the world doesn't just revolve around them. The basic concept of helping out at a local nursing home or picking up trash on a free way is a great thing! Sure it's time consuming, I won't argue with that, but it will also help students to manage their time to fit in school, athletics, and time for others.

But some kids already know what it feels like, to be in a situation like that woman in pain the rich kids down the street see on T.V. They can feel that deep in their hearts. People less fortunate shouldn't be the only ones working hard to survive, others should too so they don't think everyone's life is easy. All the brats who piggyback off of their parents never learn that feel of satisfaction that comes from helping others. If children have this sort of activity worked into their everyday schedule they can become more generous people when they're older.

I, myself, have done community service in the past and learned to give and receive happiness in return. When you ask a man in withered, old, yellow rain coat sitting on a street corner his name, his story, instead of looking past him and hoping you'll never have to look him in the eye, sit down, shut up, and listen to what he's got to say. You might be surprised and that's what I think kids in my grade should learn to do. Not from some second step program about bullying, they're our bigger problems in our world that this generation has to come to terms with. Therefore I think it should be mandatory for every student to have to do 10 hours of community service every quarter.",4,Community service,Independent
94DDDE49F8DA,"Dear Mr. Principal,

I have noticed that there is a diversion between students in our school who take part in community service, and those who do not. These students who take part in community service are putting their best efforts to helping their local environment, schools, and families. Those who don't take part in community service are not hurting only themselves, but also hurting those around them who need help. They would rather do what they want, and not what needs to be done. They will never feel the satisfaction of knowing they helped someone in need, nor will they ever feel appreciated by those who needed help. I strongly believe that all students in our school should be required to take part in community service.

Students should not have a choice to participate or not. If it were required, some students may not enjoy it at first, but I assure you that once their time is done they will appreciate the satisfaction they receive for taking part in helping to do something that would not be possible without them. Why wouldn't you choose to do this? The major outcome of adding this requirement to your curriculum would only be positive. This would help students realize what they can do if they really try, and this would help many people and places that need it.

If you choose not to do this it will effect many people. This will effect the students who so far have chosen not to take part in community service. This is because since they have not chosen to help yet, if they are not required, I'm sure they wont change their mind any time soon. This could also effect many areas who need help because less people will be going to clean up local places, or help local people who need it. If you choose to do this, as I already said you will be helping many people. That is why I strongly believe that all students in our school should be required to take part in community service.

I think community service is a wonderful thing for the people and for the community. In my opinion i do think community service should be required, because it gives kids in the community rights to straighten up and learn to act mature around other citizens. It will cause a less amount of labor for older citizens in the Frisco community. Also it will get several of amounts of work and jobs done.

For the punks that slack off in class and don't do what their supposed to do or told to do it will also give them something to do instead of slack off by the TV all day and play video game. I've always thought community service was a good thing for the trouble makers and just for the kids that want to be responsible in their young life future.

Almost my whole life i have tried to teach people how to have good manners and how to act mature. Community service is by far the way to role. Community service is already required for the citizens that choose to make the wrong choices and slack off.

why not just make it for everyone. It will give a person something to do and go on their record of time made up. Because if you don't already know the thugs and punks in this world that make bad choices usually end up regretful and don't succeed in life, and end up working off at gas stations with no money in their bank

Community service should not be forced upon students.

It is very good for a student to perform community service but, it should be the individuals choice.

You can not force kids to good deeds you can only encourage.

Many kids are to busy for community service and already after school activities they are participating in.

Community service is not a necessity.

After school sports and activities are played everyday by many kids not all students have time to join in with community service also.

All kids should be participating in some type of activity outside of school.

It is good for kids and gives them something fun to do with their free time.

Community service is an excellent choice but can not be handled underneath some students schedules.

A child must have some independence.

He should have some say in what is free times go to. Not all kids think that is a good use of their time.

You can not force the kids to do good deeds.

What you can do is encourage the kids to do good deeds.

Encourage the school to participate in community service.

In most cases encouragement is much more effective than force.

Let the students decide whether they want to perform community service.

Encourage everyone about this great after school activity.

Community service is important for children to take part in I believe it should be a requirement for school. Helping out the community does take time away from what they need or want but in the real world you have to give time up for others. Community service is great way for kids at this school to grow. This task of helping will make them more giving and willing to help out , which is a great characteristic for a child to have. Simple tasks of service will help them be more responsible. They will have less time to finish what they need to, but it will have the children buckle down and be more efficient and responsible when it comes to time management. Community service also gets kids involved with their own community and have opportunities to help out and make the community a better place. By getting involved they are helping out the community and their self .Also it'll change the out look that many kids have about the community and they will have a better understanding of how a community functions and its problems. Community service does no harm it only helps the person participating in it . Simple services like cleaning up litter can make the community a much cleaner nice place to be in. That simple task will also teach the volunteer recycling methods and teach them how to treat things with respect. I believe community service should be a requirement it helps teach kids to be more responsible , giving, and caring. Children should have those qualities in their character and community service is a way they can explore the community and be a better person.

I believe community service is good for the community. It is good to help the community to me because some people can't be as lucky as others are. With community service you can try to help them. I mean there are all different community services to make your community better. So why not help out by taking some of your time out to help people and/or your community.

I believe community service is good and the opportunity shouldn't be wasted by sitting in the house playing video games, or watching T.V. When community service is out there you shouldn't waste it which it always is. Some kids do not believe someone when they say community service is fun but once you get into it, it may change your mind.

When you do community service it can also help you in life by showing people you care. Sometimes it might even look good on a college application and other times you can show people that you want the community to be better and show them that you care what happens to it and other people to. I do community service sometimes just to help people out and i believe that other kids should to. I think that to pass at least high school and graduate you need at least so many hours of community service. That could help the community out a lot even by just giving some money or serving dinner at a soup kitchen.

There could be fun community service and there could be boring. You can go to the soup kitchen and help serve food, you can go to a children's hospital and help out, or you can even just collect money or food for people that need help.

Over the past week, I have heard that you might be requiring all students to participate in community service. As our community is relatively dirty, and has a lot of trash and litter everywhere, I certainly think that all students should participate in community service at least once over the school year. I think that the town certainly needs a clean-up and this is a great way to do it. Of course, most students have busy schedules, and may not be able to participate in it on a certain day. As a community, we need to take care of it ourselves and therefore, all students should be required to take part at least once over the year. I would be willing to help you, and maybe could be the assistant in the community service.

The town of LOCATION_NAME has some very disgusting neighborhoods and this causes water pollution, air pollution, and any other type of pollution you can think of. This causes diseases and other sicknesses that could possibly be fatal. Well, as it is our community, I definitely think that we need to do a large pick-up at least several times a year. For example, in the neighborhood of Trianon, families will take out the trash and then it will blow away, and they don't care one bit. If a neighbors pet eats something that blew away, you could get sued and the pet could get very sick.

As some students have a busy schedule, they may not be able to take part in some of the days where we do community service. Therefore, I think you should definitely make ten or more days where students can come out and do something good for the community. I will go out and find who can do what on which days as the assistant in this. From there on, you and I could make a schedule for days on which most kids could do the community service.

Finally, I would be asking you to allow me to be the your assistant in this job. I have done a community service before and know how to get it done properly. To sum it all up, I would love to be your assistant in this, and most certainly think that this town needs several big clean-ups with the help of our students.

Community service: an assignment that many students detest. Many say that it's too time consuming, that they have better things to do. Others just don't see the point of providing a service to their community. Whichever side you're on, it all comes down to one question: Should students be required to perform community service? In my opinion, yes.

As a young mind in a world diverse opinions and perspectives, I have seen that the generation I live in has become a ""me"" generation. In other words, this generation of students has become so selfish and absorbed in their own personal needs, they've forgotten that there are other people in this world who have greater issues that they must face. For example, when students are requested to give money for a charitable cause, such as helping the less fortunate in third world countries, they choose not to. The sad part is that this refusal to help others in need is not because they are uninformed, but because they are so caught in themselves that they are too selfish to even provide for someone other than themselves. As a matter of fact, 87% of students in middle school stated that if they ever had the chance to give back to their community in a simple way, they would not. The point I'm trying to make is that requiring community service of students will push them to lay down their pride and conceit to assist someone else. By doing this, their hearts will be softened and in turn, they will learn the simple joys of serving someone else for a change.

To reiterate, students should be required to perform a community service because it will give them a chance to put their ""self love"" on low by helping others. The way I see it, students are on one side of the fence, and because they've never left that one side, they have been led to believe that it is all sunshine and rainbows. However, by requiring of them to take the fence down, they will realize that the grass is much greener in the other side. Don't you want to lead your students to greener grasses?

I think that it is very good to help the community and i think that it should be a requirement because it is very important. I think this for a few reasons, there are always people around us that need help with something and us younger people should take the time and help them. Also, it can benefit the students in a few ways.

There are many people that could use help in the community and it wouldn't be hard for us students to help them. For example, an older person that lives on your block and has a hard time shoveling the driveway when it snows a lot. You could always go help them and they would appreciate it very much. Things like that wouldn't effect the student a lot because he or she was probably already shoveling his own driveway. That is just one example of a simple way a student could make someone's day a lot better.

After helping someone with some thing they maybe couldn't do by themselves or helping with something that benefits the environment it always makes me feel good about myself knowing that i did something positive. This may help the students confidence and also may help them with interacting with other people. For example, I have volunteered at a summer camp for elementary school aged kids and it helped me a lot with interacting with other leaders like me and learning to problem solve. I think things like that could also help may other students.

That is why i think it could be very beneficial to have students participate in community service. I hope you will com

I think that students should do community service i got three good reasons why we should do it first it helps our earth to be better planet , second people might think this school is clean ,third it helps students like us to be clean. Now i going to give you the details about the first , second and third reasons .

The first reason i chose this one because in earth the earth oceans they have been litter 25% percent in our ocean have been litter. Cause rain pulls the trash in the beach, in the river that might cost all contamination in our supply of water. Then people might be sick the entire week so this great reason us students should help.

second if we don't have a mess the our might think that this school is clean that they even show respect on the principal. Even if professor TEACHER_NAME might give this school a raise on the new cool stuff we can get. we might put teams of four to clean one side of the school so i could be faster because the more groups you get the faster you clean this school of litter . So this is another great idea to do community service .

Third it show how clean and mature we are on responsibility's it might help's us be better adults then others. Then will be less job for the people who help clean this school. The better mature we are the better the help we a",3,Community service,Independent

I personally think that you should encourage community service but, not force it upon oneself. Many people have extra time to do helpful activities such as community service. For example, some have jobs or school that run late and are not able to do activities during the day. With the economy today in its depression many people work as many as three jobs just to support a family although they would like to help out to do their part. Some people have better jobs therefore earn more money and have time to do extracurricular things such as community service. I feel that if people do have the time they should, in fact, try to do something useful for the environment community or so forth.

When you make something law people are not going to want to do it, but if you stress the fact that it is such an important matter most people will want to help out.

Instead, however, i propose this; come up with a group activity that is fun and can help out the community while encouraging people to do good. You could get a class to take a field trip to the beach and help clean up the shores, but at the same time turn it into a picnic and a fun day at the beach.

This is my outlook on the current matter of community service, i hope you will look into it and consider my thoughts. I think that if we find a successful way to do this we can truly change the world one school at a time and get people involved of the matters of today.

There are a lot of issues pending at the moment such as global warming, pollution, waste, world hunger, and poverty. I consider community service important but i feel that to really make a difference people have to want to make a difference we cant for them to. This is why we must stress the issue and its importance and make people understand it better.

It is my belief that our community could use community service as it helps our school as it not only provides students with a ambition to help their city, but it shows them how good it feels to do something helpful. Also, if the students are out there helping then they may inspire others to do the same. As long as they are out there they aren't wasting away with their lives and succumbing to peer pressure, anything is better.

The feeling to help the environment around us is what we look up to so, not only are we doing ourselves good, we also do good to the young ones that look up to and respect us so that one day they may also aspire to help the environment around them. There are of course dangers that come along with the tough job of helping our community, an example would be, predators prowling the area, this shows that we would need to protect the students while they are working. Also, students may turn a blind eye if they want to help, so they will fit in with their crowd of friends.

With the threat of global warming, the Earth needs all the help it can get, with all the smoking, littering and polluting in general we need to band together and keep our Earth safe.

So all in all, it would be a hard project, helping our community and all, but pulling together we would be able to do it.

9D29CF8A1C16,"I think students should do community service because the earth needs our help. Many huge companies hurt the earth by burning fossil fuels and that hurts the earth in many ways. If we don't help the earth who is? Everyday people uses cars to go to work and buses to bring your kids to school but all the smoke gets stuck in the earth and makes it hotter then it needs to be. If we recycle it helps the earth very much. Many people throw away plastic bottle water and that goes to our lakes, rivers, and oceans. People drink bottle water so much that put them together and it goes around the earth. If we keep doing little by little we can make earth a better place to live for us and animals. If we don't do nothing now very soon there would be no earth or humans. When you think about it its very important to do something. They're many little every day things you can do to help like car pool with friends, recycle, and save energy. The world is a very special place that we need to take care of. Like a mother takes care of her baby we need to do the same with the earth. We all need to do something to make a change. We have to reuse, renew, and recycle. All the things that look little makes a huge change in the world. So I do think students should help the earth by doing community service.",3,Community service,Independent

I think all students should do community service because some students have to much time on there hands. Also students should do community service because our world would be better whether its just cleaning up the litter from people that throw things on the grown or to go to different elementary schools and help the younger kids with work. If our students at SCHOOL_NAME were able to do community service i think our community will be a lot better. Our community would be better by our kids and parents in the local district being happier and also they would be happier in what we did in our community by making our community cleaner and safer. I believe if we were able to do community service at our local elementary schools students would learn to like school better and learn that what ever they do in school it can get you a good job, also it would get kids to have a better education. Also for kids to help our community to get up and go help out our planet by making good choices and going out and picking up peoples litter because our animals out there are getting hurt. Our birds our fish and other animals they are just like people and people wouldn't want there homes looking trashed by the litter.

I am writing to you about the topic of community service. I stand by the option of requiring students to do community service. I have many arguments for this topic. It would make the students better people, they would help their community, and make the student feel more grateful. Let me explain to you my reasons for a requirement on community service.

Doing community service would benefit the way a students acts. For example, community service will help make the student a better person. They will learn to care for others and not just themselves. They will also be healthier. Instead of sitting indoors all day the students would be outside helping others, being active. This is how community service would make students better people.

Doing community service will greatly help the community. If all students were required to do community service then they will help improve the way their community works. If the local stores and centers don't have volunteers then they will get almost nothing done. They can't hire a bunch of people either because then they won't make enough money to support themselves. But if students are required to do community service then there will be a never ending supply of volunteers. This is how community service will help the community.

Doing community service will make students appreciate what they have making them more grateful. By doing community service the student will learn not to take advantage of things like money and food. If they help set up a homeless shelter and see how many people have to go possibly days without food. It will make the student care more for what they have and never take advantage of it again.

Some students may disagree with community service as a requirement. They may say that they have important things they have to do at home or at school. Well they don't have to do the work every single day. They can do it whenever they're free. The students should only need to do so many hours a year, but more hours is always better. So don't worry if you're busy, you have plenty of time to help your community.

Those are my reasons for a requirement on community service for students. It will make the student a better person. It will help make the community a better place. And it will make the student more appreciative and grateful of what they have. Now please pass this requirement for the sake of our community.

Sincerely,

A fellow student.",5,Community service,Independent

I think students should be required to perform community services.

We should be required to perform community services because it will keep us out of, harms way and it will keep us out of trouble. Also it will help us make right decisions through out our lives.

well first of all doing community service would keep us out of harms way.

I think it will keep us out of harms way because what if you can imagine your self going home and some random strangers come and start to harass you. Then all of a sudden one day instead of harassing you the stranger just kidnaps you. I' d think i would do community service instead.

Second i would like to say that doing community service would keep us out of trouble. lets say that we go home right after lunch and go do bad things with some friends of their's. Now lets mixed up and say that he had community service and that if he missed it that he or she would get in a lot of trouble. So instead they would stay in school and not be in any trouble at all.

For the last reason i said that it would help us make right decisions in our lives.

What i mean by that is, imagine just a little thing you change in someone's life like giving them community services after school. They would probably end up think about actually doing good in school and getting a great job by adding one small step in their life. I mean just consider it, it might save there life.

For my summary i would like to conclude that giving community service would keep us out of harms way , keep us out of trouble ,and it would help us make the right decisions in our lives. For these reason i have written i wish you may consider.",3,Community service,Independent

I know that you have been struggling with the idea of weather to assign kids to do community service or not. Well i can help you, Here are my reasons. I think that kids should do community service so that they can help people, help the environment, And help make a better word. Because i think that helping is very important. I mean if i had the kind of money that i could pay people to save the environment i would.

For starters, They can help people because there are a bunch of home-less people that need a safer place to live. If kids and grown ups helped we could make the streets a better place for people that need help. The kids can clean up the streets so that the home-less and people passing by can admire the beauty of our country and it can help the environment to. For people that just come to visit we want them to come back no go around and spreading the word that our country is a dirty place for anyone cause its not. The world didn't dirty its self up we the humans did.

Also they can help the environment by cleaning up the beaches and that's one place the places tourist like to go mostly when they come to the U.S.A. Plant plants so that we can have cleaner air to breathe. Stop companies from polluting our rives and lakes. Pitting a law that could clearly state that anybody that pollutes has to do some time in jail, I mean they all ready have the community service for people that pollute but lets be serious to our selves there aren't many people looking out for them. We can take this job serious and help our community.

Clearly we can help make the world a safer place and not just for home-less people. I mean we see little kids running around and playing and we see them with out shoes and we don't stop and give them ours. No what we do is turn our backs to them and there are even some of us that talk bad about them like ""cant their parents take better care of those kids"" or ""oh, those pore kids have no money"" but we don't stop and help them. That is one of the worst things a human beings can do to another person. Just help out when ever you can. It doesn't have to be every day or course if you could that would be great but it doesn't have to be like that just help around.

My conclusion is that kids should help out the environment. Well not just us kids everybody should but since you are the principal just count us kids. Yes it will do some good for us kids to help out the environment and to see another part of the world. Not just how we see it but hoe others see it. Let us kids help out and you will se that you will be very happy that i sent you this letter to help you with you're choice and that you wont regret it.

BEF5E55E29CB,"Dear Principal,

My position towards if students should be required to perform community service was an anonymous yes. In my opinion by performing community service you are not only helping the community but also yourself. By helping the community you benefit from it because it builds your self esteem inside you, it will lead to a better future, and lastly it can help you towards your dream career. By performing community service you are doing the community a major burden.

When you do community service I think it will make you feel good inside or in other words build your self esteem. Have you ever had that feeling in your life when you know you did something good and you felt good about doing it? Well in my opinion by doing something good will follow and you will want to keep performing your duty of helping whether its people in need or the community.

By helping the community I think it will help lead you to a better future. Everybody dreams to have a good and successful job such as maybe a CEO of a company or even a doctor, but most definitely not a burger flipper at a fast food restaurant. When you help your community you will feel very good about yourself. You will be praised for what you do whether it's the key to the city or even a solid gold plaque as a reward for performing such a wonderful task.

When doing community service you not only help the community but also yourself because I think it will lead to a better career. By helping, you will have many opportunities in life to have in the future. There are some jobs that exhibit helpfulness such as if you like working with people you can become a doctor or even if you absolutely love taking care of the environment by either cleaning up litter or even watering the plants you can become an environmentalist which is also one of the spiking job offers of the year.

In my opinion even when I perform community service you not only help the community but also yourself. Even you as our principal perform community service by fulfilling the happiness of your school and by running things very smoothly and with no hassle. By writing this letter to you I have hopefully influenced you. If your community was in need of help would you help them?",4,Community service,Independent

I'm writing this letter to you because

I care about our environment and I think all student should participate on community service. It will help us to be clean, to not litter, and recycle. If you put us to do community service it will teach us a lesson and we will care an take care of our environment.

You can put some schools to participate clean the streets during or after school. Every time someone try's to litter change there mind an actually go through it in the trash. Every time someone go to walking they see the streets clean and help them realizes that if they doing something to hurt the environment to stop doing it an to help there city.

And if you have a sport you could go after that sport, or before that sport to perform community service. If I were you, I would let the students choose for them selves. If i was in this position I would choose to do community service to get to know a little about what i am learning.

C79DB872B022,"I think that the school should be able to require community service because it will let the student's know that they are doing something right. Because some student's are very incosniderate , meaning they don't care. But if the principal decided to have it, then maybe it will change there minds and think to there selves that they are doing a good thing. And sometimes when you do good things for people, then they will do good things for you. Even if your doing a good thing period. It should make you feel good about yourself. I know this because i do good things for a lot of people. By helping them through things, talking to them if they need someone to talk to, and if someone doesn't get what to do or why they should do this, i say because right after you do this , it will make you feel good about yourself. I know it helps me! The best thing to do , is to do community service like every other day. And besides it would put a good example on our school. What i mean by that is , that it will make our school look nice and like we have good people that actually care. Some people in school are very rude and disrespectful to the teacher's sometimes. And they really don't deserve it because they help us through a lot and they make sure that we get our education and they help us when we need to stay after for school. We all need school though because if we want to get through life then we need to get through school and college in order to get a job and a house. For the students that are bad , then they should do community service when ever they get a referal. Maybe that will help them understand what they did wrong and it will help them figure out for themselves that they would rather off be good. There is no such thing as cool. People are people and the kids that think there ""cool"" , then they probably don't want to go through life. Because the people that do call themselves that , are most likely the bad ones. The kids that don't pay attention and that don't care. But why not have community service? Nothing's going to go wrong.

I think that all of the students should not have to do community service. I would love to go on my spare time to go and volunteer at elementary schools and to go pick up trash but i don't think that community service is for everyone. Middle school students have a lot to do on the weekdays and on the weekends .For example ,during the week students have homework to do in some of their classes ,and then they have extra activities to do outside of school so they really don't have time to do community service. On some Friday's i have girl scout meetings that i need to go to and then i have to do other stuff with my family on Saturday and on Sunday.

C848E72F7CE0,"Dear Principal,

I don't think that it should be a requirement to do community service. There are many after school activity's why not make this one of them. There are many children that would probably just leave, and not help the school at all. Requiring all students to do community service just is not fair. Most students have after school activity's like sports, clubs, tutoring, and helping other people.

Another thing that is not fair is sum children are already doing community service. most children need tutoring to get better grades in school, and community service would just hold them back from getting the education they need.

Sum people may think that its worth it to donate time to community service. Although others would think its a waste of time and not do anything at all. You may think that it is a good idea to make all students do community service, but me and a lot of the school do not think kindly of it. most people would see it as a punishment. Like they did something wrong that they cant figure out. That is why you shouldn't do community service to all students.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that many students should perform community service. Though some may be busy with other requirements it's always good to help out. I am all for you making students do this for many reasons.

Personally I would perform community service if you asked me too. Yet, I know many students who are not able to. For example sports, they play a big part in some of their lives. I know that they play a huge part in mine. Also sports require good grades and lots of work, that may take up a lot of their time. The games and practices could make them very tired and performing community service may add to that exhaustion causing them not to any homework or other requirements.

I understand that doing this is a big help to the community, but they also need something else going on besides this. At least going to a movie or to the mall every once in a while. Though it makes sense that they need to think about other people and not always themselves. Helping the community or environment around you really makes a difference.

Principle I'm not saying that you should have every student perform community service and I'm also not saying you shouldn't. All I'm putting forward is that either way I support community service and I know other kids do too.

I don't think your students should be required to take part in community service for a number of reasons.

First, and most importantly of all, community service during school hours would be a distraction to the education needed in the school.

Since the students have a certain time that they are allowed to be held at the school, it would be impossible to have a time of community service, as well as the regular, daily curriculum.

This is an example of why community service should not be required at your school.

Since it is very hard to find a job right now, a student would need all the education he or she can get.

If you took an hour away from a class every day, and there are 180 days in a school year, requiring community service would take away 180 hours from their regular education.

In that entire class that was taken away from them, here are some examples on what they could regularly be doing: they could improve their math, science, or writing skills.

They could even be learning: Spanish, German, or possibly Chinese.

So obviously, requiring community service would be a huge distraction from the education system.

Some community service may not even be the best for others.

Most would be good, for instance: picking up trash in a parking lot.

However, if one of your students is going to be teaching math or science to another kid as community service, it would be much more effective to be learning from somebody who is in a regular math class, that doesn't have to shorten it's time because of required community service.

However, if community service was not required, then a younger kid could be tutored by one of your students that is in the math class he was before, that has all the required curriculum that the school offered.

However, there is still a way you can have a number of your students participate in community service.

You could offer community service as an optional class, so your school could still partake in community service, without it having to be required.

So for example, instead of a student taking one of the following classes: Spanish, French, German, Latin, Chinese, computers, or gym, they could take an hour out of there day, and choose not to do an optional class, so they could help the community.

This way, you could still have the kids who do community service, without it being forced. As well as people who don't want to participate in community service, who choose to do an optional class instead.

That is how I think community service should be handled at your school.",4,Community service,Independent

My position on the subject is not to require all students to perform community service but only the students that choose to volunteer for community service . I say only the students that volunteer because when they do it their going to mean it and put lots of effort towards it. Also it would be after school so it would be coming out of our own time. Lets say you just got home from school and your tired and have lots of homework .Would more required work help you no our you wanted to study with friends you wont have time for it. But when its not required you can make time for it.

Also you should have a choice to put the subject out there as a extra project but not make it to require to students but their free time to do so. Because we spend 8 or more hours at school taking more out of day will effect or plans after school and putting more on our plates would just be wrong if it is force. All im saying is make it a extra not required assignment to the students so they can do it if they want to do community service

I am against Community Service and tutoring elementary kids . Here are my reasons why . Community Service does take away time from us students need . For example some students may or may not go home right away . They probably have sport to go to , be with friends , tutoring , or detention . We don't have time for Community Service . All of us work too hard to be needing to do Community Service . By the time we arrive home it'll be around 6 sometimes maybe even 7 . We'll still need to eat , do homework , shower , chores , and then watch a little bit of television . At the end of day were tired and stressed out from school . Why do we need Community Service added to our list of stress ? It's a waste of time and energy . I agree the environment needs to get clean . That ain't our job though ! Get somebody else . Tutoring elementary students is helpful and may feel good after you've tutored . I personally wouldn't want to tutor some students may feel that way too . What if were the reason they may have failed a test ?

I would want a more experienced person to be teaching my kids not some Junior High or High school student . We don't know as much as we think . That's why teachers should do their job and what their getting paid for and teach the students right so us students don't be needing to tutor other students .

I think you should require all students to perform community service because many students laze around with nothing to do, when they could be helping the community. Many kids who are bored tend to get caught up in bad things , such as gangs, drugs, and violence. In requiring kids to perform community service, you are preventing them from doing bad things, you are giving them something to do after school , and you are helping them help the community.

I walk around my community to see kids fighting, doing drugs, stealing, and other bad things. If they had something positive to do after school and on the weekends , they'll be less likely to get into bad things. They might find that they like doing community service. So if more kids are required to do community service, they'll stay away from bad things.

Many kids are bored after school , with nothing to do , no friends to play with, so they sit around and get fat and lazy. If there were something for them to do after school, such as volunteer work, they'll be more prone to go out and make some new friends. They might become more open and confident.

And lastly , you were to require kids to do community service, you'd be helping them give back to the community. They could make the community a better place, by cleaning up trash , and helping the community stay a nice, safe, and clean place.

So , I think you should require kids to perform community service, because it would be good for them AND the community.",4,Community service,Independent

Community service is beneficial to many individuals, groups, and areas. It brings out the best in many people, including those who carry it out. It shows good personality and is superb for getting into college. However, if community service was to be necessary, then it would not be as beneficial. If community service was mandatory, it would not be viewed as a nice thing, it would not be enjoyed by all, and would not be as beneficial to the community.

To begin with, community service would not be viewed as such a nice thing if it were required. For example, two schools in an area have their 8th grade students do at least an hour of community service a day. Eventually, people would forget how nice it is because it would become a usual thing around the town. This shows that if everyone in 8th grade performed community service daily, or even weekly, citizens would view it as the students doing what they need to do, rather than how nice those students are.

Furthermore, community service is done by those who enjoy helping others. If all 8th graders had to do it then it would not bring out the best in them and would be dreaded by some.

Supporting this, the whole 8th grade of 120 students have to do an hour of community service a day. 40 out of the 120 do not like the labor and dread it, causing them to have the thought of community service in their heads the whole day. This would cause changes in attitudes throughout daily life . In addition, it would lead to bad attitudes towards helping the community and bad habits for the future.

Finally, citizens would not view community service as beneficial for the community as they do now. For example, all the students of the 8th grade work every day for six months for the community. As the seventh month approaches, civilians cease to realize how helpful community service is because they are so used to it. This concept is the same as taking the ability to walk for granted. It demonstrates that when people are used to something, they begin to take it for granted. This will eventually result in little or no appreciation of community service.

Helping the community is great for personality, beneficial to the community, and excellent on a resume. If it became required for even just 8th graders, then community service would negatively change completely. In addition to community service itself changing, personality within students and some citizens will change, regarding community service. It is important to not take community service for granted because it helps the community and brings out the best in people.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Isn't our country a great country to be looked upon by the world? But how could this greatness continue, if the higher authority will not to teach children to help society?

Before all its power The United States of America has encountered so many things, it's the adult's job to teach the children of the future to not make the same mistakes and do what is right.

Community service will be an amazing start, with this children will be responsible, grow into a better person, and become great leaders.

First lets talk about them being responsible.

Everyone knows how kids act- cause their kids, they don't know how things work, because they are still getting the in the use of things.

With community service kids will become responsible, because kids would know that someone or something relies on them, not just kid's X-box or Wii.

As a principal wouldn't it be a honor to receive word that your school is the best school, due to the students doing a great job!

Yes it would, so start opening your mind to the possibilities of children may become really responsible thanks to you.

Next, thanks to community service about 8 out of 10 kids become grow into a better person.

Tired of children loosing it and breaking into fights, leaving trash or breaking the rules?

It is very tiring, but thanks to community service all of your problems could go away!

Isn't it better to hear student's say that they helped the city pick up litter, rather than making the litter?

Now you see that if students are forced to do community service kids will not only help themselves, but help the school the district and eventually the world.

Lastly, with community service students will become great leaders.

Our founding fathers did not start leading the nation immediately, no they had to start form the beginning slowly climbing their way to the top.

So that's what the principal must do.

Community service will be kid's stepping stone on the way to success, think about the possibilities, won't it make the school proud if they knew that because of them, the old school bully because of community service, grew into the senator of California?

Now that you have seen community service from different points of views, you should now consider community service in your school.

I think that students should be required to perform community service because if we can make a change in the world we should do it or atleast try because if one person makes a change so will others. Like for example littering people don't realize they are destroying the nature by throwing garbage all over and it doesn't look good if you are trying to enjoy yourself in a park with garbage all over so we should try to pick up trash all over and serve our community and make the world a better looking place.

Community service doesn't always have to be boaring or a waste of time because it could also be fun like you can shovel snow, or Babysit u can just take a time when you are not doing nothing and go out and better the world. Although u may not realize but by helping the community you are making yourself look good and also your community. You make people feel better about where they live and u can also put smiles on peoples face's and it will make u feel proud. Although community service is free you do it to better your community and everything you do will help you in the long run whether it makes u a better person or whether it helps you achieve great standards.

This is why students should have to do community service because it will help us achieve, and the world to succeed. This is our world and lets make it a better one for our futures generation. We can all make a change.",3,Community service,Independent
726A55CB1411,"I don't really think that it should be required to take community service, because people aren't always the cause of liter, polutants, biohazards, etc in their own community, however, if people would like to volunteer to help out in their community and get graded on it by the school then I would be open to the idea of that. People shouldn't be forced to do things they don't want to do. That's the only thing i have against this. Even though it would be benificial to the community. I would say let the kids that get detention and do bad stuff help with the community, to give them something to do outside of the detention room. Students that are proven avid literers should be held responsible for their own actions. But also another reason why I'm against this idea is that most citys pay a crew to drive around town, water plants, clean town monuments, pick up liter, etc. this could potentially take away their jobs. A great reason why the idea is good is it helps give the students a sence of responsibilty, and helps them know what work is about at an early age. Plus it gives the school a reputation as being good and caring for the community. But that isnt always what its about and the students should have an option to. It would be great assistance to the community though, teaching students how to keep things the way they should stay, clean. And give them a sence of respect to their own community. Right picture, Wrong idea. Now tutoring other students is another thing, students arent always open to the idea of helping other classmates with their work, but others are, again, being graded on volunteering would be fantastic for some of the helpful students.",3,Community service,Independent

The issue of whether community service should be required has been brought to my attention.

Although some student think this could take up the time they have to do the things they need and want to do, others think it should be mandatory.

I would have to side with those who think it shouldn't be required.

If you're going to do community service for people, it shouldn't be forced, it should be something that you choose to do.

I think that our school should have a few days of a certain month that we have to do community service, but only to show students that it can be fun and they can volunteer where they want to work and who they want to work with.

Volunteering is something that should be done out of the goodness of your heart, but if students are exposed to different types of it, they may be more likely to go out and help people, not because their forced to, but because they want to.

Students should have some say in where they volunteer and who its with so I think that there should be a sheet that they fill out saying where we would like to work and a list of the three people you would enjoy working with the most.

Every Friday in April should be a community service day where students choose out of a few choices where they would like to work.

They should be grouped with other students who would also like to volunteer at the same place.

As well as exposing kids to different places to volunteer, this will also give them a chance to be with other kids they may not see all the time.

It could be a great opportunity for students and teachers alike.

The students help out where help is needed and it gives teachers a chance to catch up on and grade things that they may be a bit behind on.

If students are given this exposure to community service and all its benefits, they will be more likely to go out and volunteer on their own.

Only a few times a month per year should students be asked to do community service and the rest should be when they decide to do it on their own time which, I hope, will be fairly often!

Thank you for listening to my concerns!

I think that you should consider students to perform community service because we need to do a better job cleaning up our only world. We need to do this because this is the only world we have if we don't do a good job we wont have a world to live in.

Students should do this because we really need to do a good job cleaning up our world. A cleaner world is better world. Students need to do this because this could be a wonderful opportunity to make new friends and have a chance to get to know your friends and teachers better. We also need to help teachers clean up.

We need to do this because teacher are the people that educate us and we need to appreciate them better. So if we make a mess in their classroom its our responsibility to help them clean up and help our environments. The reason I support on the position that I am in is because students have been getting in trouble a lot these days, so I am proposing that if they don't listen then they have to do community service. Now i' m not saying this should be a punishment i' m just saying that this should be encouraged by people so they can wake up and say ,""What's happening to this world."" I want them to know what is happening to this world.

My goal is to see people cleaning up after themselves. If we meet this goal then we are on our way for a better community. We can actually meet this goal if we all actually try. We can meet this by cleaning up trash, cutting down on paper usage, and using more energy efficient items. This is why i support the position that i am in.

I would like to give my opinion on doing community service. First of all I do think its a good thing to do and help people who cant do it or just have to much work to do. Doing service should be a thing you have to do because its a nice thing to do and most people are not busy enough to not be able to do it. You should have to do some work to achieve honors role or being accepted to a new big thing. Also it shows that you are nice and work hard to do what ever you put your mind to. I just finished my community service by helping at a elementary school. I had to pass things out give ideas make things more clear and just exedra. People who do not have any time at all on the other case have the chose to do that or not. For them it should be an extra credit type of deal. There are just some people who have to much in there busy lives to take time to do service . Some people might want to start making money so they take a job and cant have the work hours of to help. Others may be over whelmed with school work and are way to busy. So yes in my opinion people should have to do work but only if they can.

I heard about what you are trying to get students to do ""community service"". I do think this a good idea and i want this to happen but there are some students that might not even care about this and not follow along with this plan. I would think it would be better to form a group at school and let students who would want to help with this process. Some students don't have the time to go help, even if you forced them to help out. Plenty of students have after school activity's that they cant miss out on. I do agree with you 100% but i don't think it will work a bunch if we just made kids do it. Lets just try at the beginning of this process to make a club at school for the people that are interested and will participate with all their effort on community service and if they like it well maybe they can make a speech of how great it if to help out in community service. I would really want some kids that are not involved in a lot of activities through out the school year and that are not doing good in their grades, because i think it would help them out to figure what's out there in this big world and it would also probably help them get their grades up.

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME. I am a student at your school. I'm am writing this to inform you of my opinion on whether or not community service should be required for all students to perform. I think it should be required it would be a great learning experience for students. Keep reading if you would like to know more about my opinion.

One reason students should be required to do community service is it would look good on applications in the future. Many colleges look for community service on college applications. Some people require community service when looking at job applicants. Doing community service might give you experience in a certain job field too; this would be an added bonus. Which, could help you out later on when applying for jobs.

Another reason students should be required to do community service is it can help some students grow as a person. For example, the student could be shy, and it could help them break out of there shell and talk to new people. It can also help them get a better example of what the world is really like, and what they need to do to help it become a better place. Community Service would be a great way to get students more involved with their community.

The last reason students should be required to do community service is it could help them stay out of trouble. It could get them to stop ignoring their homework and to stop staying out all night on school nights. It would be a great learning experience. Especially, if they were doing something they really enjoyed. Some students have sports and after school activities to attend to. So, they probably wouldn't be able to do community service everyday. So, they would have to set specific dates. Requiring Community Service would be a great thing to add to our corriculm.

Hopefully, you follow my advice and require students to do community service. Many students think its a waste of time, but I think if the put forth and effort and participated in it; they would change their minds and come to love it. Community service would make a our community a better place and open student's eyes to what's really going on in our community. Community service would be a great learning experience for the students in our community.

I think we should have to do community service through out the year starting in the 6th grade. It can help you with a better chance to give back to the community that has given to you in the past. It can also teach us to be more generous to the people around you.

So If I may say, this can be a great way for students to be nice, and show there Christianity to other people. Over all cause we come form Christian family's, and from a private Christian school, that has taught us to be nice and generous to the people around us.

For the younger kids, some don't understand what it means to give back to the people around you and be generous. Such as going along the highway and picking up garbage, or going to some elderly persons house and offering to rake the leaves or take the weeds out of there garden. It can be hard for them, but they can still do little things of community service. Such as going to a nursing home and singing to the elderly, or even just talking with them. They can make cards for people that they know that are in the hospital right now are in the hospital right now or are going through a hard time. They might just make their day. So i hope you take this to consideration and think about these things have been addressed to you, and make the school even more happier with you decision. Thank you.

067194796AD7,"Every student needs to, at least, practice one community service task at which they choose. It would help our community be a better place and be good for kids to get out of the house and know they can do something also. Whenever you do a task, it makes you feel good inside knowing that you did something to help someone or something else. Some examples of this would be- babysitting, picking up trash, mowing a yard, or even something simple like helping a neighbor organize books or movies. All of those simple deeds can make someone happy and you may even get you something nice in return like chocolate, a meal, or even a simple and sweet hug.

Yes, it can take time away from hanging out with friends or going to a movie with someone special, but why not ask them to you do it along with you. It would make the task easier and not take up a lot of time. Knowing that you have someone there that will always help you and that you have a good time with, can make the job less boring than if you were doing it by yourself. With a friends help, it can decrease the hours and amount of work spent on that task. A friend can also make working more fun and can also tell you that no matter what they are there for you and want to be with you so they would do anything to make that happen. They might even tell you that whenever you want to do another task just ask them because they had a great time and want to do it again sometime.

Getting students involved in community service is a great idea! By doing this students will have the opportunity to help people in need, help the environment and feel good about doing things for their city. I think all student should be required to do at least 10 hours of community service each year and in this letter I will convince you of that!

By students performing community service it gives them the opportunity to have fun by helping the environment. For example, if all the students from each grade got together and went somewhere in their community and planted trees, that would be a great learning experience for the students and teaching them about how global warming is effecting our planet would be a great way for the teachers to encourage the children to do more with helping the environment.

Next, by children performing more community service it gives them the chance to help others. For example, students could go on a field trip to a local nursing home or a homeless shelter and sing Christmas carols to the residents around Christmas time. I would have loved to have done something like that in school but it was never required that we do community service so it was not done. Also by doing this, the residents would enjoy it and would talk highly about the school.

Finally, by children performing more community service students might feel good about themselves for helping others and the environment. Who could not feel good about helping others and making a difference? By feeling good about themselves students' self esteem level will increase and they will always remember what they did to help someone else and help the environment.

I hope my reasons and examples have convinced you to require all students here at SCHOOL_NAME to perform community service. I think helping save the environment and helping others are so important for young students to do so that whenever they are older they will also wish to do community service.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing to you to discuss my feelings on requiring students to do community service. I firmly believe that requiring students to participate in community service would not make for a happy school environment. For example, forcing students to help would make them angry about having to give up their free time to help if they would normally choose not to. Also, if community service is forced onto students, they will most likely not perform to the best of their abilities or return to do extra services.

If you force community service onto all students, many things could happen as a result. Grades could drop due to less studying time, extracurricular activities could suffer due to less time to participate, and students could become more hostile towards faculty and each other. This, in turn, would cause upset parents to complain about their child's grades or behavior. All in all, this is just not the kind of thing the school district would want to deal with.

As has been shown throughout history, forcing people to do tasks they do not wish to do has hazardous results. And as we have recently seen in Egypt, people can revolt. Now I'm not saying the students would overthrow you and send you into exile, but there are other ways students can cause revolt. Students could act out and cause disruption while performing community service. Obviously neither you, nor anyone would like to have the school district represented this way. Furthermore, if community service was mandatory, students most likely would not enjoy it and would not volunteer any further.

I have a few suggestions on how to get students to volunteer without making it required. Talk about volunteering on the announcements or have someone come to the school to speak about how good it feels to help in the community. Offer rewards and incentives for doing service. Hold a contest to see who has the most volunteer hours all year with the winner getting a special prize. Any of these things would get many students to volunteer because they enjoy it, not because they were forced to.

On my behalf I think we should do community services. Cause these kids tend to think they have maides and they dont, and we are the ones who throw the trash all over the grounds we need to stop that. That's very unsanitary for our health and for others. So I think every Saturday all the kids at our school should do community services for 1 hour. I think we need to start this next Saturday at 1:00p. m. and we can stop when we notice that trash not on the floors anymore. After a few weeks they will get tired of this and start treating our school with respect. So! Do you like my plans? Our school need alot of discipline they go learn, and what about the visitors when they look on the outside and come in the school building and see how its looking. They might want to put there kids in another school because i school is unhealthy and that might create termites, roaches, and rats. So we need to get this school together and stop making stupid and redundant mistakes and get self discipline about these students because its like they running the school you not you need to put your feet down and show them who is the boss get mean and OTHER_NAME they go behave that school.

After much consideration I have decided that you should not require students to perform community service. I am a large supporter of community service, such as the U.S. Marin e Corps Reserve's Toys for Tots program, but i feel no student should be forced to do something they might not want to do. Education is all about making choices and decisions and I feel every student should make there own choices and decisions. I encourage community service but i feel the final decision is up to them. This decision should be up to the students because of the reasons of efficiency, choices, and college resimay value.

First, to make every student do community service would not encourage every student to try hard at the service they are doing. For example, if you do not want to help shovel dirt for the building of the new library but were forced to you would no work very hard on shoveling the dirt unlike the volunteer who wants to help so they work hard. And as a result of this public projects might have more people working on them but they would not work as efficiently.

Next, is all about choices. The school should not make it mandatory to do community service after school unless it is for a optional specific program. The reward of helping the community and being know as a good citizen will draw people in to the community service projects not the school making people do them. Students should be allowed to make there own decisions.

Thirdly every student puts community service on there resimay to college doesn't it then, if every one has it, become worthless? Kids who apply with merits of community service have a slight advantage of those without community service but by giving every one community service doesn't that take that value away? So this would discourage all students from community service because the competitive college aspect becomes worthless then. So thus it should be optional.

In conclusion, community service should be optional. It you make it mandatory you remove it's incentive and value. And if it's incentive and value decreased it's efficiency would go in shambles. We want efficient volunteer projects to continue, so students should not be forced to participate. It would be for the better.      ",4,Community service,Independent

If i saw my friends just sitting around i would tell them that helping out others in their community is very helpful and should do other community services.

Some people like to perform community services like helping out a pet shelter or just helping people on the street. Other people think that community survive is a waste of time and energy and i think that they should at least try it once to see if they like it. What i think about this topic is that all students should have to do at least two or three hours of community service a month or however often they would like. They should have to do this so they experience how other people live and to spread joy and love to other people then just yourself. Also, I think that community service would help kids learn more about respecting others and themselves. If you, the principal made us do community services i would be happy to help other people in their dally lifestyles. Also, in school I think that the teachers should do the community services with their class and other students that would like to join to help helpless people out.

In this letter I hope that I can influence you make working fro community service an mandatory exercise in school. Many of my friends believes that working for the community eats up too much time, and forces them to stay away from what they like to do the most. However, i think that every student must be involved in something that helps the parks, kids, or maybe even the environment. I speak this from experience because OTHER_NAME, a organization requires 30 hours of school hours and 4 hours of community hours. I never managed to get these hours for community service. This is probably since I barely have any time to work. Getting to perform the community allows a person to help the world become a better place. With many national problems such as pollution or education problems, it is necessary that us kids and teens help out. Someday, many of these students may become important leaders that helps the community or the unfortunate people. Although my friends should enjoy the time that they have, many of them usually stays home and play. Game systems or the internet is often why the kids doesn't want to work. But I understand this, since I felt too tired or un-necessary to help. One major hurdle that I found was that I barely got any reward or didn't feel like I had anything accomplished after working for several hours. School should provide better motives for community service. By being required to perform community service, it could lower the moral of kids and show a bad outcome of the work. Students should be forced in a way to work, but also have a fun time if they know that they are eventually be rewarded. Participating in these events, such as helping elementary schools are very important because it gets kids from different age groups to get along. When older teens tutors younger kids, it may show a positive influence. If a older generation of students are required to help, many kids may willingly help the community. In order to get this work, schools should provide more options to chose from. Libraries and parks often takes college or high school kids. This leaves middle school kids in the corner with nothing to do. It may be that because finding a job to be difficult is way kids see that community service takes too much time. Whether or not this letter changes if kids are required to work in the community, I hope that the least this letter can do is to show that not all kids want to spend their time indoors and rather spend some time helping out a certain cause.

Community service is something that I believe that we should all be helping with at some point in our lives, as it greatly benefits the community, of course, and it can help us feel better about ourselves. I know that some of our friends would think it would be a waste of their precious time to even pick up trash instead of going about with their comfortable daily lives, but participating in community service can and does have its benefits.

I know that you are already debating on whether or not all students should participate in community service, but maybe a few opinions from some of the school's students might influence your decision, if you haven't already made your decision.

I do believe that we both know not all students will want to volunteer for community service the first time, as what I did the first time I was given the option. Community service includes tutoring elementary school kids and clearing the streets from litter. It's some form of assistance that benefits the community and will pave the way to a better future, and even though I don't necessarily agree with the idea that all students should be required to participate in community service, I think that the option to participate should be given.

A simple example would be to pick up trash and litter off the streets. That keeps the place looking clean and it keeps the city life forms healthy (By that I mean the small animal and birds that hang out in the city.) Cleaning something should be something that we all know how to do, and picking up litter would satisfy the people who are new to community service.

Of course, voluntarily participating in any even tor activity means that you want to do it on your own time and accord. Not all people would want to participate, but for those who do, it helps the city in a huge way. After all, one person alone can't do all the jobs and work that is required for many people to do.

I am currently an eight grade student attending your school.

Some of my friends and I are currently working community services hours and enjoy doing them.

Many other schools require an amount of service hours to graduate.

I think that community service hours should be a required thing in order to graduate.

Some of my friends agree with this, but many of them don't.

The argument is that we, as teenagers, should be required to do service hours to graduate.

Many teens do not agree with this because they say they have busy schedules and do not have enough time to work service hours and want more time to hang out with friends.

Well, I do not agree with this.

I think that service hours are very important because it teaches teens to be more responsible and helps them find out where their interest are in life and what they enjoy doing.

This will also help them pick out high school electives.

Also, it is very important that teens help around the community, because it helps them grew more responsible and mature.

Community service can put teens in positions were they have to talk to adults to find out what they have to do, if they are doing it right, and if it is being done well.

This will help teens take constructive criticism from a boss, which will prepare them for a job.

The other argument is not having enough time for friends because they play sports or involved in other activities.

Well, if they are on a sports team then they are hanging out with their friends while at practices and games.

Also, you can do service hours with your friends.

They can plan a time when they all have a free night and do service hours in order to finish them for school.

After they are done with them they can then hang out.

Services hours are can be very fun if you are doing them with your friends.

If they do them with friends then they have the chance to hang out and help out the community.

I strongly think that our school should have a required amount of service hours that they have to finish before graduating.

I believe that service hours help prepare you for the future and find where your interest are and what you enjoy doing.

You are also helping your community by having your students do service hours.

The students can do them with friends and they can have fun while doing them.

This will also help the community grew and make your students more responsible and mature.

15F20233CFA6,"I think the students should be able to choose whether they want to do community service or not because not everybody is in shape to do alot of things around the community because they could have had surgery or their bones might be to weak to be walking around all the time, and if they have things wrong with them like that then you should not make them have to do that and be up all the time walking around and doing everything for you that you don't want to do and they should not have to do that as specially if you don't want to do it and say that your not going to do it then why even say that they have to or even try to make it a law that everybody has to do it except for adults and we have enough to worry about like our school work getting chores done at home and taking care of ourselves and our pets, so that don't give us any time to do community service unless we want to and if we have free time to do and if that was to ever happen then it should at least be only twice a week and we should be able to pick the days then we should be able to get a sheet of paper so that way we can write down what we picked up from around the community and then each piece of trash we pick up should be some kind of bonus and the same if we were to help people out like say they needed help loading up the groceries in the car and they couldn't do it all by themselves and that is my opinion. I am pretty sure that alot of other teenagers would think the same exact thing and if the principle tried to make it any longer i think that everybody would go on strike.",2,Community service,Independent

What is community service? It is an outwardly showing of concern for the place that we live and care about. But it is much more than that. It is a way to show that we care about our community and the people in it. A way to better our lives and the lives of others by sacrificing our time. And although community service is wonderful way to show awareness of others and to better our world, it should not be made mandatory.

All communities, whether in intercity New York or rural Kansas, matter to the people who live there. And it is out of the goodness of their hearts that they use their time to improve the lives of other citizens. Making community service required, you would not only rob the students who perform it on their own of the self-satisfaction they get from serving their country, but make helping our nation more of a chore for those who are forced to do it.

Strong communities make for a strong nation. And if you see that there is a need for more community service work, I encourage you to motivate your students. Make community service fun! Have food drives for the needy. Set up dinners for the homeless hosted by the school. Initiate peer tutoring programs to help students with special needs. With programs such as these in place, you will see that your students will begin to motivate themselves and each other to continue this service. By giving your students the means to help others, you will not only start them on the path to helping others into adulthood, but give them the feeling that they are contribut to make a brighter tomorrow.

I think that we should have community service. Some of the reasons i think we should have community service are because then we could learn to help the community and not only our self.

Some other reasons are because we could learn new stuff and people would be very happy with our work. Also because if we do it and we might like it then we might do it when we are older. We should also do community service because we would be helping our school for it can be clean and it wont be messy. Another reason is for people could now not to make a mess and to clean up after them self. We should also do this for we can have respect for our school and for when we are outside of school and for we can know to pick up after our self every where we go.

We, the student of SCHOOL_NAME, most certainly should take part in community service.

It's important for teenagers to understand how to help others, and not just think of ourselves.

Teens are selfish and they need to see how those who are less fortunate have it.

For example, the Thirty Hour Famine.

We could give up food for thirty hours, as a fundraiser, and give the money to a homeless shelter.

Homeless people don't have the money for food.

We take eating and shelter for granted.

Why do we do this when there are people out there who are starving and thirsting to death?

The Thirty Hour Famine would be a great way to help out.

Also, we could do something simple, such as helping with the Miracle League, for a school project.

The Miracle League is a baseball team for special needs children and adults.

They need buddies to help push wheel chairs and to just support them and help them to enjoy the game.

These children and adults often feel as if they can't do what the normal person can do.

My brother is one of these children.

Seeing how much they love it on the field, I think it would be a great way to get teens to better understand humans with special needs.

They need to understand because I often hear them insulting people with the word ""retarded"", and that really bugs me.

They need to see that being different isn't a bad thing.

They need to see the truth.

Community service could even be something more simple than that!

Have you ever seen the kids sitting alone at lunch?

Or even the poor children crying every day?

I fear that bullying is increasing, and children are left feeling more alone than ever.

Wouldn't you advise us to reach out and become friends with the ones that feel hated and depressed?

Suicide rates have gone up and it seems like more children are cutting themselves and relying on self inflicted pain to be a part of something.

I've had kids from SCHOOL_NAME tell me they were planning on committing suicide, and just by being a friend, I've stopped them from doing it.

I know what it's like to feel alone.

But most of the students at SCHOOL_NAME are too worried about their ego that they shrug this horrible fact off.

We need to get out there and help!

Don't you believe that teens need to quit worrying about their video game scores and their television sets in order to see what life is?

I believe that not doing community service makes teens become the selfish, lazy people they are today.

Let's reach a hand out, and be good to those in our community.

Who knows, you may even save a life.

I think that students should attend community service because that can keep them doing productive things and not getting into trouble, not being bored but doing something to help out, doing community service could keep kids going if it were a paying position or added extra credit to their grades whether or not they are good or bad performances. I think the principal should make the decision to require all students to perform community service because it will help them exceed in life and to not give up. To keep students interested in performing community work is to schedule it to where everyone is with their friends having fun and also taking part in management. Having students do community work is a great way to teach them to manage well, to not give up when something is hard, having those certain people around to push and motivate every student there when seen to be in struggle of working. Helping the community is also a good thing to do, you want to be proud of your neighborhood and satisfy the people that you share the community with, it feels good to know, hey, I helped someone do this or that, or Yeah, I put a smile on this persons face. Require community service, it's good for the students. Students that believe community work is a waste of time, they're wrong because helping your community is worth the time taken up and the work put into the community, if no one was willing to help out with the communities, they'd all look awful, dirty and not cared about, no one wants to live in a place where its all dirty and nasty, and full of litter, and dirt. The kids that don't care for community service aren't doing anything better and they know it. They're either sitting at home bored, wasting time, or taking unto actions that could completely throw their lives away, such as drugs, vandalism, stealing, being disrespectful, joining a gang of such. When they could be doing something way more productive helping out the community, making new friends, meeting new people, feeling good about themselves, learning different things as well. It says that children must attend school until the age of 16, so the principal adding community service to the school requirements, will keep children going in life until, they run out of juice, completely. It shall be a mandatory thing for all students, grades K-8.",3,Community service,Independent

To help the community or to not help the community, it's a question asked by many teenagers of this generation. Though most people would be disgusted by the idea of picking up trash at the beach or helping out at retirement home, I think that all kids should do community service to make their lives and the community a better place. For example, most of the movies or television shows people see, it always revolves around doing the right thing and making the right decision, but when the teenagers really come face to face with community service, most of the would be either annoyed or disgusted. They would think that doing community service takes too much time away from what they think they ""need"" to do or what they want to do. But have they ever thought about what a better community they would live in if they did community service? For instance if you love the beach, don't you just hate it when you just want to lie on the beach and relax or go surfing but always have to be around great number of sea gulls picking at trashes next to you and being pelted bye plastic bags in the waves? If the children of our generation loves the beach so much, they should just pick up the trash they found-or even threw themselves-then everyone can enjoy a happy and clean ecosystem/community.

Doing community helps everyone, including oneself and the ones around them. Especially since the children in this generation have been introduced to so many violent and/or inappropriate video games, television shows, and movies-whose only focus is to add excitement and get maximum audiences and money-they are bound to be corrupted, so in doing community service, it can right the wrong of the improper way of life that had been inflicted upon us by the media of today, the same media that would show and/ or sell anything in order to get the maximum audience and make the most money possible and have never thought about the consequences that would have in the future of the United States. So step by step, we should start shaping the future of this generation and the future of the United States by doing community service!!!

5C232C7B0EFD,"Performing community service is extremely important, not just to the community, but to those who are the effort behind it. Setting a requirement for students to do this is an excellent idea, because all of the students would then gain the benefits of community service, including important life skills, such as time management and the ability to try new things.

While the argument against students being required to do community service is that they would not have time for other things that they want or need to do. What these people do not realize is that they still will have time for these things. If they do community service in addition to everything else that they do, they will have less time to do it. However, this strongly encourages the development of a life skill that is vital for success: time management. If a student does not manage their time well, they may not have time to do everything that they want to accomplish. However, once that student improves, and starts becoming a more efficient worker, they will be able to accomplish everything they want, from homework to watching telivision. With this skill, people can accomplish much more, because they suddenly have time to.

In addition to this, students will be able to provide community service in a variety of ways. This allows students to try new things, like explaining concepts to younger students for tutoring, or cleaning up litter on a road. A student who tries all of these things may discover how much they love working with people younger than them, or how much they care about the environment. Even if someone discovers how much they despise working with younger children, so be it; they can go pick up litter around town. Also, if community service becomes a requirement, then all students will be able to take hold of the opportunities presented to them, not just those who chose to do so.

Overall, requiring all students in our school to do community service is a wonderful idea, because, even though the most obvious benefit of the work is the results in the community, the student gains just as much from the work. They learn skills vital to a successful life in the future, including how to manage time, and the importance of trying new things. It would be taking away a plethora of opportunities to gain these essential skills if it were not a requirement.",5,Community service,Independent

I think that community service would be an excellent way of using time. It would be good for me to start with the classics and pick up the garbage off of the ground that nature has given us, basically because it is the only one I know about. It would be a wise choice of time to help the community, and Earth by picking the litter that some people carelessly throw on the ground. Spending time to help the Earth does not bother me a single bit, as long as it is not too wet outside. Many students that would be enthusiastic to give assistance would be glorious, but it is not fair for others to do it if they don't want to. I can understand if they want to stay at the comfort of their own home, and I don't really expect many people would do community service to use their ""valuable"" time. In my own opinion though, I think that students all over the world should do this at least thirty minutes a day or week, it's what you choose, but that is only me. I would not mind on how any of my friends would think about me, it is how they should feel about not helping the planet they live on, or even one of their friends. Also TEACHER_NAME, I think you should give the students that do community service some extra credit on their grades, which brings me back to what I said earlier, they should not do it if they do not want to, they just wont get the extra credit.

Many people are doing community service. In my opinion students should be required to have community service. It is a great way to show support to your community. This could help students to become better people. Cleaning litter could help the environment.

The first reason for community service is that it will support the community. Most people would feel like doing the right thing. It would probably be less crime. For example helping others could change someone's mind set. They'd feel as though they had a purpose which is to help.

Second of all, it helps students become better people. Helping the community can become a habit. Tutoring a student can change their future. They can become successful one day. The person you taught might recognize you for their success.

Finally, cleaning litter can help the environment. For example cleaning around the school makes it more presentable. It also leaves a good feeling that you have done something great. It shows leadership and character. This could come in handy one day.

In conclusion, Other students are doing community service to show support. It can may students better people. The environment is bettered when cleaning up litter. This shows character.

Community services are important to are community because people volunteer for no reward at all. I think that community services should not be required. They shouldn't be required because the take time away from other activities and the should only be performed if that person wants to.

Community services take time out of persons schedules. Some people might say that they can make room, however they're times when you can't unchanged something. An example of this is a doctors appointment that can only be filled on the day and time they said the would. Another example is a practice for sports when the coach plans ahead for when the game should be played and the players don't even get a say in what they want. Also, people may need to do homework or already have a job and can't do it. An example of this is when teachers hand out homework and the kids fall behind on it because their volunteering. Also, when a kid has a job the don't need to do more volunteer work when they already are. Community services take away time.

Volunteer work is not wanted by many people. Some people might say they can switch to another activity, however if they want a activity that someone else has they can't do it. An example of this is when someone thought the wanted to tutor but then realized it was horrible and waned to switch to pets but someone else already had it the have to stick with tutoring. Another example is when you must be assigned a volunteer job and can't choose it and it's luck if you actually get one you wanted. Also volunteers may think there workers are not good. An example of this is when a person works with a friend ,but the friend make them do all of the work and the boss thinks both people did it. Another example is when you dislike your boss will tell you to do something ,but someone tells them they can't do and the boss blames them. Volunteer work is not wanted by many people.

I hope that this will show why not having required volunteer work is good. It takes away time and is not wanted by many people.",4,Community service,Independent

Have you seen our earth? It needs help. That's why i think you should make kids do community service! It will make our earth cleaner. I will tell you a couple reasons why i think kids should do community service!

Well to start off, i think kids should do community service is because all kids do when they get home from school is watch television and play video games! But with everyone coming together we could make this place a more efficient place to be upon. I also know some kids wont be happy about this, but when they realize they are working together to help the community they should feel better about themselves. Kids should get out of the house more often and help out with the environment. I hope kids start getting out more to help out our healthy world.

In addition, I think there are plenty of things to do outside! A couple examples to do outside would be to pick up trash or tutor someone. If you pick up trash, people might notice and they will stop throwing stuff out of there car window. They also might help pick up trash. If you help someone else they other person will benefit with a better education, that will be needed for a good job later in life, or the kids might be nice to other people since you were nice to them! You might want to do other things that i didn't mention, and that is fine! As long as you make it to were the kids at SCHOOL_NAME do community work, this planet will be looking good in no time!

Last but not least, I think it is good to help out. You can get a lot by helping others! If you do sports or something in that category then you could be recognized at the end of the season for volunteering outside of school. This could be useful if you want to do something and you have a good back ground! Getting recognized for helping out is a great way you could be a better person! TEACHER_NAME if you let children help out, it will be great for them!

In conclusion, I told you it would be a good thing for the kids so they are not at home watching television and playing video games all day! Then i also told you there are plenty of things to do outside for the environment! Finally i told you it would be good for kids to help out with the outside world, not just in school! I no it'll take time away from school, and we need our education but if you think about it kids may want to help out, some might just be to afraid to say something!",4,Community service,Independent

I think we should have all students do community service.

We can start by doing service in the school by helping it keep clean.

we can also clean up our streets and we could have some kids donate food to a homeless shelter. The reason why we should do all this is because so the people that can't afford food can have something to eat. Picking up trash can be a great way to help the earth.

I have some friends that would love to help out with this and plus you won't be board because you will have your friends with you to keep you company and also help out in your community. This junior high school has a lot of thing that we students can do to make it a nice school like we could pick up trash if we see it in the hallways just by doing that we make it cleaner and keeping out lunch rooms clean that could make it clean too. We can donate food that goes to waste everyday at this school to anther school or homeless shelter that needs the extra help. If we just take some time out of what we do everyday and just help by visiting a nursing home and we could just make their day and students could go play with little kids and read them books. This is why I think all students should do community service and plus your helping out your community the place where you live and just by doing all that you could make a big difference.

By picking up litter we are helping the earth. We are saving the animals and the people. We are helping animals because we are picking up things that can chock them. Or things that they eat but they shouldn't. We are helping people because its saving our earth. That produces more for us by us helping. If we helped we would have less things we would have to kill for.

We are also showing younger kids that taking a part in things like this is good. Even if it is reading to younger kids maybe that would encourage you to do more and you would want to make a big difference and you begin to take on more challenges. Then you start doing more and more. Kids would also like that other people care for them and they would like the fact that we want to help out.

People that think of it just as taking away there free time would learn a lot from the experience. They would start to enjoy it just as much as other people did. Also if you think about it, it would go good on a college application.

My name is STUDENT_NAME.

I am writing on the subject of whether we should require all students to perform community service. I personally think that community service is very important. Students should be required to do community service for many reasons. Many students would be getting into trouble if it weren't for community service. Community service teaches people, especially students, responsibility.

In high school, community service hours count towards credits for college, many schools even have clubs for community service. If you put you mind and give all your effort towards it, community service can actually be very fun. If the school planned days to do different community service activities together many students wouldn't think of it as a burden. Doing anything with you friends can make the most boring of situations actually quite entertaining. Also, if there was some reward given at the end of the year for most community service hours many students would take part in the community service.

I believe that you should make community service required in our school. You should make community service required because it shows kids to be thankful for what they have, makes them get into real life situations, and a kid can't take one hour a week to help in their community? Community service makes kids think different in every day situations like should i bully some kid that has no parents or should i give him a complement?

When i downtown to the animal shelter to volunteer i feel good and thankful for what i have. I feel that if kids do community service it shows them ""wow i have a lot, thanks mom and dad!"" kids fight with people everyday over what they wear, how they look, what they say. We are all lucky if we can walk, have a roof over our heads, have someone their to support you, have clean water. People across the world can afford food everyday. Here in America we should be thankful for what we have!

When we are older we are going to deal with getting a house, buying food, making money; real life things. If we don't know what is ahead we are not going to know how to handle things. If we can just help out in our community like real young adults we are going to have a better way of living to know what happens ahead of childhood.

If you are a kid you play games, computer, and watch Television some people can't even afford a television. If we can't use one hour a week to go and help our community and sit down and sleep, that's bad! we have hours and hours of saying I'm bored. Well go help the community! In America we can be better people everyday, why not make it better by making community service mandatory.

I think if you want America to be a better place then it would really help to make Community service mandatory just to make people stop complaining. You are living that's all that matters, your trying your hardest to make life better. Maybe we should try to make some ones life better.

I think that community service should be required because of many reasons. First of all students have to find a way to help the community even if its helping elderly people or cleaning up litter. They should know that if we put something in something will come out so that means that if they do good things for their community, the community will give good things back. Such as if a student goes to apply to Dartmouth with a GPA of 3.8 but he did not do anything to help his community or did many sports, but then theirs another student who has a GPA of 3.2 but has helped his community a lot and has participated in many sports. Who would you think the university will pick for a spot? Also, people think that community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do, and that is wrong because when you are helping people it is not wasting time because you are doing something that helps influence and the people around you.

To help a community you have to have something inside of you that is called ""Compassion"" because you are showing compassion when you go and help the elderly women plow that snow from her yard, you are showing compassion when you go and help that man bring his things inside his house, you are showing compassion when you go pick up that wrapper off the floor to take less work from that janitor. So in my case I think that community service should be required because it affects the way you look toward something and will help less teenagers become less violent because they are doing stuff that helps the community and they are having fun which is better that going to go take drugs on the streets.

Another reason that i think that community service should be require because imagine if one person can make a difference by planting that plant, imagine what thousands of kids can do. They could help elderly people, pick up trash, tutor those kids who need special education or just need a tutor. Most of the teenagers could do this and much more. Also our city is turning into a very hostile city and there is killing everywhere, if we could bring all of the teenagers together and make them do something to help the community they would see that here is hope in their future and they could stop doing bad things and start doing good things

So in conclusion I think that the principle should require all of the students to do community service because if we put something in something will come out so that means that if they do good things for their community, the community will give good things back. Also, people think that community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do, and that is wrong because when you are helping people it is not wasting time because you are doing something that helps influence and the people around you. So teenagers need something to influence their lives in a good way rather than just sitting around at home playing video games . It is also a good way for them to entertain themselves and if one ""cool"" kid from school does community service it will influence other kids to do community service just to be cool and they could finally get up and do something for their community.

I think you actually should require all students to perform community service. Helping the community is very important, but it does indeed take up our time. What we should do as a school body is to be required to do 3 hours of community service. By doing so, we will reassure our fellow citizens that they do have help even if help is or is not needed. This will not only make us, as a school, learn leadership, but it will also help us to learn companionship.

This is the perfect opportunity to actually show people how we care for our community as a whole, and not just about ourself. You need to let us prove how we can not only be active in school, but also be active out of school. The student body should be required to do 3 hours of community service. We will do so in our free time. We should not be required to perform on a specific date, but on the date we choose. We could do it on the weekends or in our own free time. After doing the job, we get the sponsor to sign the sheet saying what we did, how long we did it, & any additional comments. The forms should be due at the end of the year.

As a whole, we should pick up trash on the streets for an hour. So that way, everyone can get credit of 1 hour, without having to worry about not having any done at all near the due date. As an individual, we should be able to choose what other things we could be volunteering for. We should play with disabled kids, work with the elderly, pick up trash anywhere, recycle, etc. Not only would some of us be happy to help, we would actually enjoy doing what we choose.

I think that all students should perform in community service. It's a good way for kids to get out of there house and not go on the computer after they finished their homework or watch television. Its better if they help out and make a change on earth or they can help kids get their homework done or study for big tests.

Students shouldn't just stay home doing nothing. they should at least get out of their house 30 minutes or even an hour when they finished homework. Its a good way for them to meet new people and help others or help the community. Some kids think it takes up from being with friends or just staying home but students usually see their friends in school, after school or on the weekends. They use their phone to communicate with others and keep in touch.

Why should students stay home after school ? They can help some one with homework for example a friend who doesn't understand the homework or drop off homework to a friend who didn't go to school and explain to them how to do it. They can also tell they what they did In school , for example, If they learned something new.

Students should do community service because it might make them a better person and it might help they stay out of trouble. That may help them become a better person and it can help they improve who they are/personality. They can improve in school and at home.",3,Community service,Independent

The students should be required perform community. This is because, the students will need to know about their community and what goes on. This is also because, helping the community is important, it helps them deal with real-world problems, and help develop skills for them. It they are the future, they need to have experiences outside of the school. They should help, so they can be the leaders of the future.

For example, doing community service by baby sitting, they will have experiences on taking care of their own child or children when they have them. With experiences at a young age, they will have known what it is like to take care of they child.

Another example is if the student(s) do community service at a recycling factory, they learn about what is going on in the world and what is the amount of waste humans produce in their country or other counties. Which in turn will lead them to recycle more, which helps the environment and the animals who live there. The student could also have relatives at another country which the can tell them about the amount of waste produced there and what could happen to the world if they don't. Which leads to more recycling, and that helps the world.

And for those who believe that community service is a waste of their time, they don't think about others, they think only for themselves. And that can lead to a life of crime, with selfish desires for what others have.

For example, that person could want a necklace that another wants and they ask and the person says no, that person can feel negative desires for that person. That could lead to stealing the item itself, murdering the person and/or their family members, and/or robbing the store where the person got it from because they cannot afford the item.

The reason people should have to perform community service are listed above. And also, this could lead to a terrible community in the future. And nobody would want that. They would want a tight community. And what a tight community needs is community service done.

I think the whole school should have to perform at least one community service act every week. Such as helping out at the basketball games, cleaning up the mess afterwards. Also, we could go around the whole school and pick up the trash, during or after school, this would make the school a better place to be. We could pick up after are selves instead of just leaving our trash/other objects everywhere. Every other week we could go read to elementary schools, or go help them with math. We could show sixth graders around are school so they no where to go, and no what classes to go in, and what time they need to go in these classes, this would keep them from wasting time being confused, and walking around the courtyard lost. Also we could plant flowers or trees in the courtyard and make it look prettier. When people chew gum in the classroom make them put in the trash, don't let them stick it up under the desks, or throw it on the floor for someone else to step on. Let the students come in teacher classrooms and pick up scrap paper and let us put it in the recycle bin to help our environment. We could reuse pencils in till they are all the way to the eraser. We could do a free car wash, and let people get there car washed for free. We could go to nursing homes, and bring them apples and muffins. If every student in the school does at least one of these, we should go to the beach; and help pick up the trash there too, and help out other communities and be a fun field trip.

I think all students should take some time out for community service. I know students who are teenagers don't think its a great idea, because they have so many activities going on in there everyday life. Instead, just think about when you're driving down the road and there is trash everywhere doesn't it look unhealthy for the environment? What about the animals who live in these woods don't you think they would like for this trash to be gone? If all students were to pitch in a little time to do community service our town would look great! To make it easier on people we could have schedules for everyone in the grades 9th through 12th. The ninth grade could do community service on Monday after school, tenth on Tuesday, eleventh on Wednesday, twelfth on Thursday, and every grade on Friday. Just a couple hours everyday will make this trash go away!

Dear principal,

Students ought to be proud to do community service and you should make it a rule. There is no other honor than to know you are doing something for your community. Community service is not just going around with a trash bag, you could help a lady cross the street. Community service can be beneficial, you could earn respect.

Just the thought of knowing I am helping the environment get me tickled pink. It is not a waste of time. You are doing this for a good cause, not to waste time. You could get honored at a ceremony by the mayor or someone. You could do community service by helping a lady across the street with her bags.

It can help to carry an old woman's bags across the street for her. That could have saved a life, or two. If you do community service in your neighborhood it can be a enormous factor on your personal appearance. Elders will start to respect you, that is a wonderful accomplishment.

Community service can be beneficial on you behalf if done properly. People will start to respect you in the town. You could walk in a store and everyone will stout your name. That is a wonderful feeling to have. Community service can do a lot for you if you take the time.

So principal I vote to carry out the rule. It could be use as extra credit in some issues. Community service should be part of school. Principal you have my vote fully. I guarantee to do community service everyday in school.",3,Community service,Independent

Community service is a great way to help out your town.

There are many things students can do as community service.

Students can help elementary school students who need help understanding a subject.

Trash liters the school yard and many other public places, making the town look awful.

Also, community service can teach children to be responsible.

I think all students should be required to perform community service.

Many children in elementary school need help to understand their math homework.

However, there are 30 students and only 1 teacher.

It would be very hard on the teacher if they taught the lesson then every student has questions or needs help.

Older students from middle school or even high school could volunteer to go into the class and help out the teacher.

Even if they only go once a week for an hour it would take a tremendous load of the teachers back.

Schools are a place where trash is easily found blowing around in the wind.

It liters the town, making everything look dirty.

However, it can easily be fixed.

When students are required to perform community service the easiest thing to do would be to pick up trash.

Picking up all that trash will more than likely convince the students to stop dropping their trash everywhere.

They will learn that it is better to throw it away the first time than to throw it on the ground to be picked up at some later point in time.

Students think community service is a waste of time and in no way can it benefit them.

However, they are wrong.

By performing community service not only will the students clean up the town, they will get an immense sense of accomplishment.

Plus, students can receive community service hours, which help them increase their chances of getting into college.

Many people feel that community service takes too much time away from what they want to do.

I feel that they can just do one hour a week and it will benefit tem greatly.

Community service is arguably the best way to help your town.

It not only benefits the town, it benefits the students, the children being helped, and the teachers.

The people who are currently performing community service find it a great way to pass time and make new friends.

They think helping the community is very important.

If you require every student at your school to perform at least one hour of community service a week, the results will be astonishing.

I personally enjoy helping out in the community and I know others do too. However I am also aware that some people think it is a waste of time. Personally though instead of making it mandatory I suggest that you make it option with rewards for doing so because sometimes people are busy and don't have time, some people might be enticed by a reward, and some people won't like it as much if they are forced to do it.

First off some people have free weekend to do what they want with but some people don't. Quite a few people have sports, music classes or other things they do on the weekend so that they don't fall behind on homework. And doing all these things gives the little to relax which helps people perform better later on and also allows them to have their friends over which help with social skills. And thus If you make community service banditry the wouldn't have time for those activities that promote their general health and make the more well rounded individuals and better later in life.

Secondly some people would do the service but if they fell they don't get anything out of it then it fells like a chore and then they will only do it when forced. So enticing them with a reward like a certificate for hours done or turn it into a competition where the class with the most cumulative hours gets a pizza party or something similar for just the class will make students more interested. Other rewards could be like reusable bags with the school mascot, or extra credit points if the teacher allows it for example. And if students star doing it without felling tortured then later on they might learn to enjoy it and continue doing community service later on in life.

Finally historically when people are forced to do something they tend to star wanting to fight it. Therefore if you make service mandatory and students are forced to do the ones who don't like will start looking on it poorly and like a punishment and would want do it ever again. also the will stat doing service quickly and not well so that they can be done and will leave at the minimum required time even if not finished. Also if students come into something felling that they aren't going to like it then it would be harder to change their minds and make them enjoy doing the activity.

so as you can see id community service is made mandatory many students will not enjoy it unless it is optional and can accommodate for busy schedules, feel rewarding for students, and isn't forced on they are more likely to enjoy it",4,Community service,Independent

I think community service is a great idea, but unfortunately other students think its a waste of time and will refuse to do it. On the other hand, others would like to volunteer and do the right thing. There should be a catch to this, for example: anyone that does 10 hours a month will get a pizza party with a movie. These kinds of things will persuade a person to want to volunteer.

At the end of the year, everyone who did more than 50 hours will go to Six Flags for all the effort they put in.

Everyone should get fun things to do like at a daycare center, teaching little kids to read, playing with the children that are in the hospital. Its not only good for our students, but to other people we are helping. Anything is possible if everyone gets involved to the something. With the good out of all of this, there will be less troubled people in this school. The people who help with feeding the home less will have a chance to talk to them and learn why they are homeless. It will make them realize that they want to do good in school so that they don't end up homeless.

Helping out with children will give girls a lesson on how hard it is to a raise a child and that its not a fun and games. Going to the hospital to visit the sick children is a good way to interact with people their own age. Community service is not just good to do, bit its also good for everyone to know more about life and the real world.

This is a glimpse into her everyday life. 5:00 am, wake up to feed your baby and get ready for school. 6:00 am, Go to school.2:00 pm, get out of school and go to your part time job at whataburgers. 7:00 pm, go home take care of your baby, do your homework and study, 10 pm, work your night shift and the 24 hour taco bell. 2 am, you get home take care of your baby and maybe get some sleep. Both of these jobs still don't pay enough for everything that you need, but you still go to school determined to go to college and get a good job. But then you find out that community service is required and you realize that you don't have enough time to be in school because of this new requirement. So your forced to get a fulltime job, that doesn't require a high school or college degree.

Kids who wish to and have time to do community service should do it, but it shouldn't be required off all kids to respect the difference in their lives, and the following reasons.

1. Public school is for all kids despite the situation at home, and their parents are the taxpayers supporting this school, there fore the school should respect every students home situation and not make an impossible requirement for kids who can't meet it.

2. If community service becomes a requirement, it is likely that more people will drop out of high school.

3. Kids who are in sports may have to sacrifice practices for community services, when sports can get kids into college's when otherwise they wouldn't be able to go.

In conclusion if there's a good amount of people interested in community service, then there should be an after school club, or perhaps an actual elective were you can do community service during school hours, so it wouldn't have to interfere with after school agenda. Having Required activities that take place after school hours is not fair to all students, therefore should remain a choice among students.",3,Community service,Independent

They should be home cleaning their own messes. Parents are not going to agree with this. They are going to argue with the board of education and make it a bigger deal then it already is.

You have to think about the kids safety. They can get hurt while they are cleaning outside or even inside. But outside if they are cleaning anything can happen. Theirs wild animals, wild people, cars, trucks, anything can happen to any of those kids. And who are the parents going to put the blame on.... the school. The kids are the schools responsibility, they have to watch what they do and where they go. These are things the school can avoid from being sued or getting the principals fired.

If kids have health issues like, allergies, or get heat strokes easily, or anything. Any little thing the kids are allergic to can be very hazardous to them. They can get seriously ill, or even past away. The principal doesn't think about these harmful things that can happen any second. He has to think before he makes any changes in to the school.

Ill like to talk to you about us students being required to perform community service. My position on this subject is the students should have the choice to do community service or not, they shouldn't be required to do. Here are some reasons why it should be our choice.

It should be our choice to do community service or not because first of all we as children or preteens shouldn't be required or forced to do those kind of things cause we our children not adults, and there is nothing in this country stating we have to do community service. Also sometimes from school, sports, and other activities we do we are very busy as is, and adding community service on to that we just make us more stressed as we sometimes are with all those things going on. Another reason why we shouldn't is that we want to hang out with friends and do a lot of fun things with them, such as going to the mall, seeing a movie, and playing outside on a nice day, but if we have community service we cant do all those things. Then with a lot of people saying children have to start getting outside and getting more active, what are we going to do if we have community service to do we wont be able to get more active, are we. Also sometimes we receive a lot of homework at school or have a big project to do, then if we have to do community service we might not be able to finish it before school the next day, which can get us behind on what we were doing in that class and ruining our grades.

I think that performing community service is a good idea and it is very significant to do so. The reason why i say that performing community service is important and that it is a good idea is because it could teach the youth how to be more involved with their community and it could teach a valuable lesson to them. For example, picking up the trash off of the ground, could teach the youth that it causes less pollution and that it could be very generous of them to do so. pollution can mess up people's community and i know that the children wouldn't want that at all. Performing community service doesn't take up too much time. it could only take up a small portion of someone's time

Requiring this performance would help out the communities and would put smiles on everyone's faces. It could get children to be off of their electronics and other things that they value, and get a taste of learning and helping out their communities. I really think that it would brighten up people's lives and cause for people to be happy. Once all the cleaning up is done or whatever the topic is, is finished, children could go outside and play ride their bikes, jump rope, or anything they want to do. Helping out the community could cause a big improvement.

Do not just do this for me, but do it for those who want a better community and those who want to see a change. I think that you would be proud of those who want to volunteer and help out with the community services. I hope that with all of this in mind, you make the right decision because once you make your final decision, there is no turning back. You have to realize that being involved and helping out with your community is very important and special to me.

I do not believe that you should make all kids do community service, and there are many reasons I believe this. First of all, most kids would object to doing this because it is too much work. All kids think school is to much work to begin with. Speaking of school, it would cut away at our school time too much. if we were all to do an hour of community service within school hours, it would be to much time taken away, near 20 hours each month, almost 3 entire school days wasted. My third and final point is that there is little to do. after a week of community service, almost all the litter everywhere would be picked up. Not to mention there's no town of just old ladies trying to cross the street.

2BDB4651C49E,"Dear Principle,

I think that you should require community service. Because it helps students understand why its a good thing to do and it also helps others in need. Some of my friends do community service like tutoring young kids and picking up litter.

The first reason why students should help their community is that they need to know its a good thing to do for others and themselves. When students are helping out with community service everybody looks up to them, because what they are doing is good. They then realize that community service is a good thing and will start doing community service in their free time. They could pick up litter, or paint a mural around the school or somewhere that needs those things done.

The second reason why students should be required to do community service is, that they need to realize that helping others is a good thing for them to do. Even if they don't know the person it helps them build character as they get older. The students should go to nursing homes and keep the older people company, like read them a story or talk to them about their past.

Since some of my friends do community service I believe that it would help students all over the world. My friends do all sorts of things. They tutor young children and pick up litter, because they think it is the right thing to do. Which I believe to. They now have life skills that they will have as long as they live, because of the community service they do.

This is why you should require community service at our school for students. Because it helps them get to know older or younger people. They also realize that helping in their community is a good thing to do, and that they build life skills when they are helping others. When they are working together on something, even if it is as simple as picking up litter. Small things that people do step by step get them somewhere in life, while other people have work harder.

When did a little work ever do any harm? I believe that it should be mandatory for students in our school to execute community service. It would be a great rule for our school to enforce, and I think you can agree. Students should have to do community service because it would help our community, make the students share the responsibilities of a citizen of this town, and maybe encourage them to help outside of what is required.

No matter how many people volunteer, a few more helping hands could always make it better. This town, along with most all towns in the United States, has plummeted with the economy. Which means there are more homeless, unemployed people in need of help, and more animals in our local SPCA. If we had more students doing community service, then some of these problems could be helped easily. We could volunteer to help at homeless shelters, do Meals-On-Wheels, and keep company to the elderly in nursing homes. Along with taking care of and playing with animals at the local shelters. And with so many people helping, a town fundraiser could be organized to help whichever organization is in the most need. However, this is only one reason community service should be mandatory.

Many students in our school skate by without ever having to do chores, or even try. They feel no sense of responsibility towards our town, even as its citizen. And if they were required to help those in need, it could give them a purpose to try more and have goals. I do not know many students who work to get money. Most have parents who provide for them without anything in return. When they see the real world and what is going on in the community, it could give them a moral obligation to help out all around. This could mean making them better students, better children, and better citizens as adults. Which leads to the third point.

Having students participate in local community service could encourage them to want to help more, maybe think bigger than locally. It could make them feel obligated to help out more around the community, at home, and at school. This would make the community a better place to live, and even increase moral among the students. With all the potential help from students to our town, a big difference could be made.

All these reasons and more should make the idea of enforcing community service on our students seem like a good idea. If we could make students partake in community service around the town it could make them want to help more, make students feel a responsibility towards the town as a citizen, and help out our community a prodigal amount. Besides, a couple hours of work never hurt anyone right?

I think that requiring all students to do community service is a good idea. Litter has become a big issue in most schools. It would give students something else to do in their spare time. Also it would help people that volunteer to do community service, they would have less work to do. Instead of thinking of community service as a punishment think of it as being fun because you would do the community service of your choice.

There are many fun community service activities. For example there is tutoring children, cleaning up litter, volunteering at animal shelters, and many more. Tutoring children is fun community service because it gives you a sense of responsibility, you are teaching a child something to help them in life. Cleaning up litter is fun too. You can help clean up beaches or lakes and other places, so it looks better and the wildlife that live in the area won't be harmed by the trash. Volunteering at animal shelters is really fun as well. You care for injured animals, groom them, exercise them, and feed them. All of these sound really fun to me.

If you let the students pick their community service activity they're more likely they will do it without forcing them to. If they feel it takes time away from other things they're doing encourage them to find community service activities they would enjoy. Community service can be fun if you see it that way. It only becomes a negative experience if you don't enjoy it and if it doesn't give you a sense of accomplishment.

The way think this should work is when students miss behave they are sent to ISS. Well when their are in ISS and done with their assignments then they should be sent monitored outside the school building and clean up all the trash this way they will think before they miss behave this will also be helping the community. Another way this could work is by providing a community service class to all of those who wish to help in community service. Also the school can add an after school program in witch students are allowed to stay after school and clean up the school and communities that surround the area .I also think that in order to help this problem the principles should set up a meeting with all of the students and explain to them the importance if having a clean community. This way student might start to like the process and get involved in helping keep the community clean. I hope my ideas help in someway.

87D436B64CB4,"Dear Mr. Principal,

I am one of the eighth grade students going to your school. I'm sending this letter to you concerning about your decision of requiring the students to do community service or not. I think you should not require community service because the student might have some sport activities or some family matters that would prevent the student from fulfilling them. For example if something happens to the student like a relative passes away and the funeral is on the same day of that student's community service the student would have to choose over the community service or the funeral. If the student chooses the funeral over the community service the people he or she was supposed to help would be helpless. And if the student picks the community service over the funeral the family would think that he or she doesn't care about the deceased.

If you do decide to require students to do community service at least let them choose what day they want, so they could schedule it, so there won't be any problems with the time. Also consider allowing the students to change the date of the community service just in case something does come up.

Some pros for requiring the students to actively do community service is that the community would be joyful that there are people to help out with their day to day lives. Another pros would be that the students would hopefully feel like they did something that would benefit them and others. Some cons for requiring students to do community service would be that the students might feel that they're wasting their time in a nursing home for example and would not enjoy the day they chose.

A pro for not requiring students to do community service is that students would be able to chose if they want to help or not. This will encourage students to be themselves. A con that would result from not requiring community service would be if no student wants to do community service, there would be no one to help around the community.

I know its not my decision, but I hope I was able to convince you to make the right choice and not require community service for the students. Thank you

A497C32D772B,"I have always thought community service was important but i have never taken the time to do it. This is what I think about the principal requiring all students to perform community service.

First I think if I would get involved with community service I would do things that would help the earth; for example: picking up trash, putting recycle bins on the sides of roads so that people could have easy access to putting there paper or plastic in them, or even going by the community ocean, river lake or pond to clean up around the area to make sure that no animals could get harmed by the pollution humans put on our the earth.

Next, children around the world set around and watch television all day when they could be doing things for the community, we should be able to set an example to young people to grow up and help the world so that when they grow up they will be able to not pollute the earth and keep it green. Also we can always plan a day to take out of time to be able to do what we want instead of community center time.

Last, some children involved in school might not want to be involved in community service, but some might. That is why i think that the principle should put that up for a extra curricular activity for children and students to get involved in. All in all i think that having students be required to join and help out with community service would be a very good idea to have the principle or student administrator to have put in to the children's lives. Who say's that community service is just for inmates at jail? Not me! That is why I thank you for giving us the opportunity to be involved in community service!",3,Community service,Independent

Students should be required to perform community service to help out the community. Students should be required because if students have must attend community service they may learn to not liter and it may instruct them a lesson, knowing that people have to pick up things that students drop on the floor is hard work to clean up. Also it should be a must because it keeps our community clean and nice, and is respectful to help keep the city clean.

Students should also be required to help out by such as tutor low level students. If students tutor elementary students it may help them learn better. Sometimes students understand more when it is being taught from a different kid. This could help students learn how to do there work in various ways.

Community service helps younger students to do work in class, and keeps places clean. Helping out is also a kind and courteous way to show people you care about people and the world. So students should be required to participate in community service. They should be necessary minimum once or twice a week and get some type of reward for helping out the community to make it a better place.      ",3,Community service,Independent

In community service it helps others think about what they need to do or want to do with their lives such as teaching little kids how to read or how to help other people out by taking out their garbage. It is helping other people in your community / society that really need help.

When i was a little girl my brother always told me if you want something go for it never give up. As he told me go for my goal no body else's. At the time he was still living with us and he was in high school trying to become a doctor and he is now in collage trying to get his doctorate as i think you call them?

So when i think of community service i do not think of it as a job i think of it as a way of helping me understand more and helping other people with what they need in life. Other teenagers might think that it is all fun and games but to me it would be about finding myself and finding who i want to be. Never making it just a job. Its work that is always worth it in the long run. Never give up and never bale out on something.

If your mind is set on it then most likely your going to succeed. It never hurts to try to do something that you believe in.

When i was in kinder garden my teacher asked me ''STUDENT_NAME what do you want to be when you get older?'' And i answered ... ''TEACHER_NAME i would like to be a veterinarian.'' But now if i got asked that same question i would most likely say '' I want to be a life changer.''

Community Service helps young people find who they should be never just say i have better things to do with my time, Because you do not. What you want to go play or text on the phone .... well that's not going to help you in the long run now is it? Community service should be in every young persons life.",2,Community service,Independent

I myself do not think that students should be forced to do community service because community service is something that people should want to do. Maybe you could have motivational speakers come to your school and talk about helping you community. It should be a choice either you can watch your community get trashed even more or stand up and do something about it. Maybe start a group so people can work together and get rewarded for helping out the community kids love rewards like food activities and medals (trophies). That way kids would feel like their making a change and getting rewarded that's a great feeling. Some kids think community service is dumb and gross because you have to pickup trash. But if kids get rewarded they will strive to help in their community and stop trash build up on the freeways and out in front of their own houses little thing will start to build up and make kids want to do big things like go to other countries in need of help and help out with them like in Haiti were there is still a lot of rubbish all around. Kids and adults can help out every where there is need of help from the state of Ohio to all across America and then the whole world!

But then there or those kids who don't want do anything because their lazy or cause they have disability's. If kids see adults doing stuff for the community like teachers famous actors or just normal every day people that kids look up to they will want to help out as well so if kids don't want to help its their choice. If you force kids to work their not going to their job right they will goof of get in to fights and make more trouble.

I do not think that kids should do community service because they could have other school activity's to do like band or sports.

If they wanted to or there mad them then that is fine but if you make them then they should not have to do it. What happens if they have travel softball, soccer or volleyball. If it is during the school day then yes but is they are doing any sports they should not have to do community service. I mean some kids might like reading to other kids like first or second graders but if they are in the middle school or in the high school they should not be doing community service.

When helping other people you get that warm feeling inside of you. That is what all kids should feel. All students from grade 5 and up should have to participate in community service because it will help out the needy, give back to what others have given to you, and maybe meet some new people. There are a lot of people that need someone's help in the world.

If students would just give back then they would see how great it is. Needy people just get so happy when you help them out a little. Just the tiniest things could make a huge difference to them. Even if you would just help out at a soup kitchen, or something like that . All students need to just have a full 48 hours of community service in a year. If a whole school from grade 5 and up did that; well that would just make a huge difference in your community. you could participate in building shelters for the homeless, even as I mentioned before to work at a soup kitchen, or even donate things to Goodwill or The Salvation Army. Many people have given up a lot for you, so why not give back to them.

Even if you are poor you still have to pay school taxes, and other taxes that provide things for you. Kids do not realize this and just take things for granted. I will admit that I do this sometimes, but that is because I forget about all the little things too. If students would just take the time to see these things then they too could make a difference. As long as you have a home then you will pay the school taxes for the area you live in. Why not just give some money to charity, or to a family in need. This could help them out a lot; like providing for their family, so they don't starve or become sick. If all kids did these things then they would help keep their community a better, and safer place to live. Some people give back to a community just for the fame of it.

Just because you get recognized for something charitable doesn't mean you have to brag about it too. If you get recognized for something, don't get greedy about the fame. Just do it for that warm feeling inside your stomach. I know that is what most people do it for, but there are those greedy people that don't. When a student does a charitable act of kindness then they shouldn't take any awards or anything for it. That would prove how good someone's character is; not by what they get or have, but by what the do for things that they get or have. That is how good people are built. They do things for others, and not themselves. When you get that warm feeling for something good then you know that your conscience is pleased with you.

I will admit that I have not done many charitable things in my lifetime, but that is because i haven't been urged to do those kinds of things. That is why all students in grade 5 and up should have to do community service because you can help the needy, give back to what others gave to you, and you get that warm feeling inside of your stomach. this is how i feel about community service in our school.

Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that students should be required to do community service. It will help them learn how to work, teach them responsibility, and help students get into a good college.

Community service would help students learn and have experience in working. For example, if somebody liked animals they could volunteer at the animal shelter and they would be able to say, when applying for a job, that they have experience. Also, it will help them learn more about the are they are interested in.

Community service will also teach students responsibility. For example, when they make mistakes they will learn to take responsibility for them and to deal with the consequences. Also, it will let them get a feeling of what it is like to have people relying on them and, therefore, putting more responsibility on them.

Many colleges look for students who do a lot of community service. Some now have made it a requirement and students will not be able to get into them without it. If the school doesn't provide it, then the students will feel like it is not an obligation and will end up with less choices in college and, ultimately, jobs.

I think your school will benefit a lot from adding in a community service program. It will teach them how to work, take responsibility, get them into a good college, and, in the long run, make them better students.

Thank you for your time and I hope you will honestly consider putting community service into our school.

I think students should perform Community Service why because it will help not only us the kids of the future but others as well and if they see us helping out the community then they would try to do the same as well. Community Service is very important to our environment if we don't keep it clean then who will, that's why we need to take a step ahead and put what people say about us helping out the community in the trash , they will try to join us one day . The specific matter is to teach our environment that we can stay clean such as not littering , recycling, and Community Services for a good purpose.

Sometimes i see people my age doing Community Services and mainly because the stole something from a warehouse or store or fail to go to court . Us as young people need to teach each other not to fall because if we do were going to fall in a hole that we cant get out of , when we could dig that hole for a community pool or basketball court or something to keep us in a educated service.

Community Service will change the way other people look at us , if someone came down here from Boston they would wont to turn back around because of how we treat our community but if we had a clean and neat environment they would enjoy staying down here for a couple of weeks or even longer.

This is what i recommend to students being positioned and taken part of Community Services.",3,Community service,Independent
4BC83A053CEA,"Dear Principal,

I think that children doing community service is a good way of helping people with what they need help in. But in my opinion, some kids should have the decision of choosing weather or not they want to be involved with the community service or not. The should have the right to choose because some kids really have things to do after school for example like helping your mother cook or you have to do some clean up in your house or even getting some tutoring in school. I think its still a good thing to go clean up in your community to make it a better place to live and to be clean and not nasty and uncomfortable.

Some kids in the world would want to help do community service but they might not have time to do. Some kids are right in saying that it might be a waste of time but your wasting your time to help people who are in need of getting help. So if the kids doesn't have time, doing force them in to doing community service because your just going to make them lose time that they have to do something else that is important to them too.

I would say that some kids don't like to do community service because they might think its not cool to be helping and also because they think their friends are going to make fun of them for helping out in school. I would say i am like that sometimes because I wouldn't want to do community service and having people laughing at me for doing something i care about doing. Just ignore people who are making fun of you and just enjoy what your doing to help the world and your community and you will be a good helper in your community. You never know who might be proud of you in your community.

In my conclusion, I think that kids should definitely have the choice of doing community service because its nothing bad your just helping out in your community and it really isn't a bad thing to do. But in the other hand some kids really don't have the time to do all the work that is required for community service. They might need to do something at home like clean or cook and also some kids would want to get some tutoring in school so that would prove that some kids really don't have time to work.

All students should be required to perform community service . If they choose to help our community then great, but if they do not, they need to. It is important to help our community so that it is a clean environment for us to live. If they do not help then our community could get dirty and be a great place to live and play.

The kids that are helping the community now are doing a lot of work and need more help. There doing things like planting trees, picking up trash, and tutor kids and a whole lot of other services. These kids are very good citizens for helping and people thank them everyday including some students that do not help. The kids that do not help think that i takes up to much free time and they have better things to do. They really do not have better things to on the weekend, they go home and play video games the whole day. They do not even consider helping the community.

So I think that you should require students to perform community service for at least a couple of weeks, to get the other students to thing about helping for a change. If you require it may get more students and their parents to perform community service also. So inclusion, yes, you should make in required, to get the students to help their community.

I have heard you are having trouble making a decision on whether students should or shouldn't be required to do community service. I know many people who do community service including myself. From personal experience of community service i can tell you that it can help the way you think and act around certain types of people and ethnic groups. I am not say there is a different way to act around others, although it would be unprofessional to act like you do with your friends around the president of the United States. Therefore all students should be required to perform community service acts.

One of the main reasons community service should be essential is because students now a days have more time to do these things and it would greatly impact our communities. For example if one student did community service by picking up trash in a near by park we could prevent people from overseeing these parks just because it is has trash every where. Another great example of community service having a big impact on our community is helping at the annual food drive. This could impact millions of people that are in dyer needs of food and you never know but you could collect 5 cans that could possibly be the difference between life or death.

I know it may sound funny but picking up trash or collecting food at a food drive doesn't take much effort but it does leave a big impact and i know that students are age are perfectly capable of doing these small tasks.

Doing such a little thing to a community could make a big difference for many people, so if i were in your shoes trying to make a decision about community service i would definitely say yes not only because i do this myself but because the people that we could be effecting need our help. Thank you for considering the following things that i have put up to offer. I hope your decision goes well and i know when it comes down to it u will make the right choice.

I think you should require all students to do at least five hours a week of community service.

This is because it helps us take perspective on what is happening in our community.

In some cases kids think that community service is a waste of time and that they are above helping others, these kids may like community service and do not know it because they have not tried it.

Our community is in trouble, there is a high rate of poverty, homelessness, hunger, and illiteracy.

Simple volunteering can help fight these problems; one small step is still a step none the less.

For example I have recently volunteered at the Children's Book Bank, an organization that helps fight illiteracy by giving books to kids living in poverty.

After volunteering I experienced a feeling as if I had done a huge task instead of a small one.

Inside I knew that I had done something that would help kids learn to read and as a voracious reader just the simple task of volunteering a little bit of my time felt good.

Sometimes it is not that they feel above helping others but that they do not know what it is that you do when to volunteer.

One time I had a volunteer opportunity step up, when asking my older sister if she wanted to come along she said that she was too busy and could not spare the time.

When I returned I found my sister laying on the couch watching TV, when I asked my dad what she had done while I was gone he said she had watched TV the whole time.

Finding that she had used work as an excuse next time I volunteered in the community I took her along, fight it the entire time my sister ended up loving the experience and wanting to go again.

As you can see it is not always that they are too busy but that they sometimes they don't know what it is like.

Not only is it good that we volunteer, it is crucial if we want to improve our community.

It is a simple task to volunteer, a task that if multiplied becomes a great step toward a better community, a community that is better for all of us.

Students should be required to perform community service because it'll be helpful to the community for their generosity. Students should do community service because as your performing community service at the same time your helping the world to grow and be clean. Community service helps other people have a clean and healthier environment. performing community service will make a better change in your life because your a helping hand to the community.

This helps people have more time outside then staying in your house and doing nothing. This a good choice to do when your doing nothing but watching television.

Community service may take too much time away from what they need or want but, it's better to save the earth then kill it. Community service is fun and active. I take a position in performing community service because it's helpful to us and the World. If you don't perform community service it'll make the earth have Global warming which we have right now, and air pollution. This is important because their are many things you can do to help the environment make a better place for cleanness and happiness.

Our school should have activities like this such as school clean up, beach clean up, park clean up, and etc. Many of us kids barely do nothing but go on the computer. We should be involved in these activities so the Earth wont die and give up on us.

Our school has recently been debating weather we should require all students to perform community service. I think that by requiring community service we would be helping not only the community but ourselves as well. We would be come more active, less selfish, and hopefully gain a better sense of moral. We also wouldn't just be helping ourselves but the people around us. They would feel better about where they live and who they live with/by. Making community service a school requirement would be a phenomenal idea.

Required community service would make the kids more active. Our free time is usually spent on some electronic lounging about. With community service we would be able to cut back on the gaming systems, movies, and over all laziness. We would be out cleaning the neighborhood, volunteering, and helping other people. We would become am

The kids in our school would by large become less selfish. We as children like to have everything we want and as we want. With community service we would be able to see how some people have so much less then we do. The word ""want"" would suddenly start to bring on a whole new meaning. Instead of saying "" I want that toy mommy!"", we would be able to say "" Mommy I want those people living in that homeless shelter to have a home again."" By being able to change the meaning of the word ""want"" we would have higher morals. We would think of someone else other than ourselves.

Requiring community service within our school would help promote the idea of selflessness. We would become a more active generation. We will have better and higher dreams for ourselves and our community. Our school should make community service a requirement.

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am a proud student attending SCHOOL_NAME. I have recently been notified about your plan to possibly require all students to do some sort of community service.

Well, you would be stupid if you didn't require it. As a child that has always been involved with community service I think it is the best way to help others and experience another world.

Students should learn to help others and help the world. This could change a lot of peoples views on life. It could make them realize they can be a good person and help out in a good way to the community. Most kids need something like this to make them feel good about themselves and they could have fun doing it at the same time!

Maybe you could make it a requirement that you must receive 15 hours or another amount of community service by the end of 8th grade, in order to go to 9th grade. It might just work in our communities favor!

I have many ideas for community service but here are three and I will start at something pretty simple. A day on Long Beach Island's famous beaches picking up all of the garbage. It is outright disgusting to see cigarette buds on the ground.

That would help bring people to LBI.

The next idea I have for community service is a little bit more interesting.

Holding a buffet for homeless people so that they can enjoy a nice meal for once. Just because they don't have can't afford a home or a car doesn't mean that they can't enjoy a nice meal. They deserve it probably more then you and me.

Another community service idea is having a carnival here at the school to raise money for a certain charity or group.

I believe many people would attend and we could raise a lot of money for someone or a bunch of people. That would really help, quite frankly any amount of community service would help so I really hope you take my letter into your thoughts and approve of making community service a requirement.

I think that you should not have to do something such as community service if you do not want to. I fill that community service is something you should do by choice, because that is helping the community. It is your choice if you want to help your city or not. I understand it is helpful, and it is great to do but some people just have things that they need to do for there self. There are many people that are not good people, and don't see the purpose to help other people, but that is there mistake not ours. Everyone should help but not because they are forced it should be, because in there heart they know it is helpful to do it. I have asked many people and they fill the same way i fill. I do not want anyone to be angry with me, because of my point of view, but remember this is how i fill not everyone. Me myself will always have it in my heart that it is only right to help people that are in a bind if possible, but that could be just how my mother raised me. Everyone may not agree with me but i be leave a lot of people will. I come to school to learn not to worry about if the principal is going to make me do extra outside community service work. I think all students should focus on our grades, because what we do now effects our future, so there for we have the choice to do extra things that are not the law to do. Why do i have to help the community if no one care about it? That is my most important question. I will most likely help either way, but i just want to know why everyone has to do something that is not the law. I know we have to follow the law and do what we have to do. Just like it is the law to go to school. So i will follow that law till the day i get out of high school. My classmates and i have already been in school for a long time and are half way done with it, and never had to worry about this problem before so we should not have to now. I have an goal i want to achieve and i can not do that with everyone arguing about this little rule, everyone has the right to do what they fill is right, and i fill that people can choose what they want to do. I mean all and all we are a free country, but it seams like we are not so free any more. with all these crazy things he schools are trying to make us do.

I believe that u should make a rule requiring all students to perform community service. I feel this way because it allows the student to help the community and give back to it as well. By not allowing this rule you will be giving the students more free time. And by doing that the student will be exposed to dangerous and life threatening things such as drugs, alcohol, and to being associated to gangs.

It will also give the student a good experience to take part of. For example, all students need the hours to graduate high school and it is a bonus because high schools and colleges look at the activities the student take part of after school. So you will be giving them a chance to have better and a more successful life. A student especially at a young age as in middle and elementary school needs guidance by doing community service. It will teach them discipline and guide them to making better life choices.

A student may believe doing community service is a waist of time. By them thinking that they are already going down the wrong road. A road of laziness and every thing being a waist of time. If you require for all students to take part in this community service it will allow them to become responsible and reliable adults.

You are honestly considering making every student participate in community service? I do not think you should require us to. Let me explain then you decide.

For my first reason it will be too much of a hassle for you and the rest of the staff. Parents will call and complain about their child not wanting to do it. How would students get to the sites after cleaning up close to school? You will have to pay bus drivers to take the students to the site. Depending on how big the school is you may need a couple busses with all the money going to this we could had got new text books or something to benefit our learning.

Less students will enroll in our school or some may drop out. We are at school to learn, not to pick up trash other people threw out. If students do not want to do not make them, it defeats the purpose. They already have a system that does that it is called a chain gang. They broke the law we did nothing wrong so why should we have to do it? How are you going to make sure students do not ditch you can only punish them later.

I believe it will be a great mistake and cost our school money we could be using to make our school a safer learning environment. So if you do not want to cost us everything then do not make us do it. Thank you for taking time to read this, and please respond soon.

Sincerely your student,

I think that students should perform community service because, It can help our town become a better place to be. It can clean up the grounds on which events are held, and the streets that people walk on.

I think students should perform community if they did something wrong.

Community service can be used for correction. For example in Raymond students have to perform community service when they do something wrong, with the law.

So community service can be used for punishment.

Community service can be used a extra credit too. Students can help with after school programs and tutoring. Students could be contributing to a positive situation by doing so. After all there are always students who could use extra help in school and other activities.

Community service could be used as a way for students to help the elderly or disabled in their community. They could rake leaves in the fall, or shovel snow in the winter. They could help with lawn and yard work in the summer. And because it's community service they wouldn't be getting paid.

Over all I think community service is a great idea. There are so many ways it could help the community. There should be programs in which people come together to clean up the school or the town grounds. So I think that students should perform community service.

I think that all students should at least perform a little bit of community service. I think it would help kids from being all stuck up and then they would probably like to do community service without being forced to do it. I really think that kids should do community service to help animals, plants, and anything they need to save from dyeing from the trash or anything that could hurt them. I do what ever i can to keep the earth clean and safe i really would appreciate it if you would help me get kids outside and to go around town with me to do community service to help people around the house to fix peoples yards or gardens or even fences. to like rebuild them and paint them. i would be very thankful because we should take at least a couple of minutes or even a couple of hours. To do something everyone would be proud of in the end. Plus we could get a lot of kids together and see how good they really can be and how positive they are when it comes to helping and caring about others.

I think its a very good idea to make the students of our school perform community service.

It could teach them a valuable lesson and maybe there will be less violence in this world.

Maybe we could have less murders, robberies, and maybe even less teen pregnancies.

It could teach them that their is more in this world then television and computers.

we could help everyone in the world. We could help them with we could help the homeless find shelter and food, we could visit the nursing homes to keep the elderly company make them feel better about themselves. Anything to find a way to help the people in this world.

The children who help this project could help make this world a better place. help the people in this world have a better place to live.

I agree on how all students should help community service, even thought it may take much time it will make a big change upon the school. Such as the school wont be dirty and have trash all over the school grounds. It will also help the environment so no pollution will be caused by that area. Although the school on the outside may look nice but what about the inside? You may be thinking, all the schools on the inside looks perfectly nice and clean, but some schools or even neighborhoods have trash and pollution all around it.

All students should go in a extracurricular activity to help clean the inside of the schools, such as cleaning the lockers, erase graffiti that are on the bathroom walls, or just even cleaning out the desks, it will be a much better help if they go and help the community outside of school grounds. In fact they can pick up littler off of the ground around their neighborhoods, recycle plastic bottles, or cleaning their house and rooms. its not much to say, just a little hard work and bam, your community is all good and looks new.

Some friends might think, ""Hey man, I know that you like helping the world but face it bro, there are plenty of other people helping the world, lets just go to the mall."" then tell them this. ""If you think there are so many people in the world helping the world and their community, or even their schools then how come nobody has been helping out? Every single person causes damage to the schools and community, such as going to the mall, you cant walk so you take a car, and the car blows out gas which causes air pollution. and people litter everyday without them knowing. even breathing causes air pollution, not like someone is telling you not to breathe but would you want to live in a world where the environment is horrible and the schools have trash all over the floor and grass, also have graffiti all over the place?

93112F2AC395,"Dear Principal,

I understand that you are trying to decide whether or not to require all students to perform community service. I would have to side with,

I do think that you should require all students to do community service, because community service is very important, it helps others, and you get a great feeling after you have done service.

First of all, community service is very important. It is a chance for people who live in a community to show that they care for their environment and each other as well. There are lots of ways to provide community service. Whether it being, you babysit for a neighbor, or plant new flowers, or mow a neighbors lawn.

It shows that you care and that you are willing to help so that you can live in a happy community.

Next, community service helps others.

For example if you mow and elderly persons yard, maybe that person can no longer do the job themselves because of an injury or problem that they might have. So it is very nice to help that person whether they know it was you or not. When you do community service, you should not expect anything in return. That is why it is called service. While you do service you should have a good attitude and put your best foot forward.

Lastly, after you have done community service you will feel great. You will know that you have done good and have helped some one or done something for the community.

If you decide to require all of the students to do community service it could improve their attitudes, because they are happy about what they have done. Service can be small things or big things, but it still counts. If you are happy, have made some one else happy, or have done something to clean up the environment, then you have done service.

In conclusion,

I do think that you should require all students to do community service, because community service is very important, it helps others, and you get a great feeling after you have done service. It could help with the attitude of students. And will make students happy and after they do it they will know what it feels like and will probably want to do it again.

I think the idea of students performing community service is a grate idea. In fact I'd love to help with that and take time out of my life to help with this. It may seem silly, but to me the environment is really important to me. It's where i can have my fun and skate and hang out with friends. If nobody did such a task, the world would look like one huge trash can, garbage can, dump, Etc.

To help with this important matter when we're done with our trash, we should put it in the right despoils can so that it is actually thrown away properly.

But this all should be an option. Nobody should have to do this if they want. Let them go play have fun while other kids work their butts off to make our planet a better place. When they see how their world is being treated, they'll do anything to help 'cause I know for a fact they won't want there ""playground"" to be all dirty.

Let's just say you required community service. Do you actually know how many people would do that like for real? Maybe about 9% of the school. Some kids are always complain about everything. Hey, I'm one of those kids too. But there's always times when I know I HAVE to be serious. And when it's something like this, I'm totally serious.

I sent you this letter to tell you know my opinion on whether or not students should be required to perform community service. In my opinion, I think that students should be required to perform community service. It will be a good thing to let students know how to help their community to be a better place. First, this will let students be more responsible. Second, it will let students be neat, and organized. Third, it will let students be active and not lazy.

First, it will let students be more responsible because they know that they have to clean or do their job well. Then, it will let them be responsible for their actions. For example, if they are organized or not organized, because being organized and neat is a responsibility. That's also like a mini job for them, maybe we can give presents to them after they are done. We might take this on a trip one day. Also, we might take them to a restaurant all together to have fun. We can also do competitions.

Second, this will make students neat and organized, because if they are cleaning something this is like a practice for them to be organized and neat. If they are organizing something like papers in alphabetical order, this will help them be organized. If they're cleaning up something like for example cleaning the street, this will help them be neat. No matter what they do it is something that will help them one day in their life.

Then, it will make students active, because they work out. For example, they bend down when they're cleaning, they walk when they are cleaning. It's also kind of an exercise for them. It will let them be active, so they wont be lazy, and instead of being bored, here it is, something for them to do. That will help them at least with one thing through their life. So no matter what they do they will learn something.

Finally, i think that its a good thing for students to be required to perform community service. First, it will help students be more responsible. Second, it will help students be more neat and organized. Third, it will help students be more active and not lazy. No matter what they do even if they are organizing paper, it will help them be better in something one day. Thanks very much for wasting your time to read my letter and know my opinion.

Also people should do community service to help others like participate in tutoring to help others. But i believe they should get done what they need to get done 1st. As long as they help with someone that's good to me. For example i tutor my brother and his friends that need help with homework or class work or something like that. We all know all students are not going to want to participate in doing community service because they think there to good for doing that but we can atleast try to convince people to help. Students will think community service is a punishment. But even if it is they should be happy to help others.

Community service should be recommended for all students. It helps them learn about the community that they live in and to help it run smoothly. Like picking up litter would help the earth by saving it from all the waste that humans just throw out. It'll also help animals from dieing because sometimes the stuff humans just throw out can hurt animals and sometimes kill them.

Other kinds of community service is good to. Like giving food to the people that starve and don't have any money to feed there family or give toys to needy children who don't have anything. Doing stuff like that is good to do because it helps other people around them and it also makes the person that does it feel good about themselves.

Dear principal,

I think that we should be able to choose whether we do/don't want to commit time to auxiliary others. I think this because some people may or may not have after school activities and or family matters to attend to, but others might be willing to do so. Others including myself might not have sports or family matters ,but we might prefer to have fun and hangout with our friends. Even though this may seem selfish i think if at all we have to be forced to volunteer to build character or some other reason we should do this during school hours that way other activities that are after school do not interfere with it. So it is with all of my and the other students might we ask please do not force us volunteer when the meaning of volunteer is to give an effort toward another willingly and not unwillingly and if so please allow it to be during and not after school hours.

The world needs help. People can be a part of it, make a change; a difference. The environment is suffering. Trash needs to be picked up, old clothes need to be donated, flowers and trees need to be planted. I think that performing community service would be good for students. I believe it builds character. Serving soup, donating canned food items or unwanted toys takes nothing, but it means the world to people who aren't as fortunate as we are. Why waste space in your basement with all of your baby clothes or barbie dolls when you can make a little boy or girl happy? Reaching out and helping others is a good quality that young students need to practice. I guarantee that once a student has helped out, they'll keep doing it. Along with the feeling of satisfaction and pride that most people will take away from it, they'll also get to meet new people. This wouldn't just be helping the needy, it would also be helping these students who participate in volunteering. Community service should be required for all students. Even just ten minutes could do good and make someone smile. Change a life, volunteer.

The ideas that I would like to express is something private but I would like to talk about with you. The idea is on community service. A lot of people do it but many other don't. I think it is a great idea to do considering that we should do nice things to others. I really like the quote ""do things to others as you would want to be done to you."" This quote is golden. I think that many students should be required to take part in doing community service. I think that you should have a list of jobs that are available to consider doing in the next year or so. I also think it is a good idea to have an option of group work, meaning a group of friends can work together to do community service. I think that is one reason why many student don't want to attend in doing community work.

Examples that you should have is maybe helping out in our local soup kitchen for the homeless. We as in us students can help make, serve, and supply soups for the homeless and the less fortunate. This is a wonderful thing to do in my thoughts personally. Another example we can do is by helping tutor little elementary school classes. This can help by interacting with children and sparking our own memories from when we were back in elementary. Also my other thought was to have our own readings to children either in schools or in public gatherings.

Many student including my friends have told me that community service is just plain dumb and others have said it is a great idea. I have had to give lectures to those who think it is dumb. I told them they can choose to not like it but they don't have to make a big deal about it.

I think that after so many hours of service there is required then those who don't like it can stop and those who love helping in doing this can proceed to doing it as long as they want to.

39AD2FCCD35E,"I think the principal should require community service. This is because if teaches life lessons and it is good for the community.

To begin with, I think the principal should require community service. This is because it teaches life lessons that will help you in the future. For example, I volunteer for community service at a place called PET. This stands for Personal Energy Transportation. It is an amazing thing to do. You build all-terrain wheel chairs for handicapped people all over the world, but mostly in third world countries. The wheel chairs have three wheels and are designed to go through deep sand, over sharp rocks, and up and down steep inclines. In this workshop, it teaches teamwork, and makes you more mechanically minded. It is also a very courageous, bold, selfless thing to do and it will really change someone's life. Another example is that people sometimes down want to do certain activities because their boring. With required community service that will have to do things that they normally wouldn't do. By doing these things they build character and self esteem. This will help them in the future with doing homework, getting into a good college, and even with wanting to do community service again. This is why our principal should require community service.

In addition, I think the principal should require community service because it is good for the community. It help the community in times of need. For example, when you are driving down a busy road or highway you see people throwing bags, cigarette buds, and even clothes out windows of their cars, not worrying about were they end up, in sewers, on the sides of roads, even inside animals. There are some types of community service that actually pick up all this trash around a city. This is important because it teaches character and it makes the city look better and more professional. Another example is that it community service could help other people in the community. There are elder homes where people drop off their elders that can't take care of themselves and people take care of them there. Some workers use this for community service or that is even their job. It can help you in the future to teach you how to take care of elderly people and it even help the community so the people that work out in the city don't get slowed down by having to take care of them. It could also make the elders feel wanted and feel comfortable in a new home. This is why our principal should require community service.

But community service helps out everybody. If you don't want to do it its fine. But these are some examples of why and why not to have community service.

Why to have community service: Because you help out the environment. It helps out the stray animals out there so they can have a home and be healthy instead of living in a trashy area. Its fun as some other outdoor activities. Even though there is no reward for what is done you feel like you did a great thing for you, your city, and your country. If you like to hang out with friends who are willing to do community service also, this is right for you.

Helping the environment is a great thing to do.

Why you shouldn't have community service: Maybe you think its boring. Maybe you think that just because there is no reward, you don't have to participate. You could probably have something better to do. Or maybe you think its plain old dumb. Just because it isn't fun doesn't mean you cant do it. If you like to hang out with your friends 24/7, this job may not be right for you. If you don't like community service, that's fine, don't do it.

I think that students should take part in community service. It teaches them many lessons about helping and giving back to the community. When students do thing outside of school it gives them a chance to choose and be creative. Many students do not have a sense of creativity. Many students when given the opportunity to be creative often turn it down. Doing community service outside of school gives them that opportunity. Also it gives a student the chance to give back, and sometimes meet new people. I think that people don't often see the upside to doing community service. Your really helping people that need it, you may not be as happy that your doing this but just the opposite the people that you have helped really appreciate what you do. One year i wrote letters to senior citizens and followed up on this letter by going out and racking leaves for the people we sent letters to. When i knocked on the door just the look on the peoples faces when we said we were going to rake their leaves. One women i remember she sent me and my group of friends a letter addressing all of us to give us a great thank you. Community service helps not only the people your giving the service to it also could make your friend want to get involved in community service.

Dear principle,

Community service should be a job, not for students to perform. Requiring students to do that job is very difficult, especially during school days. Community service should be a job that the government should be giving to people who don't have jobs. Students should have their time in school and after school to learn and enjoy part of their life. Example, that of a person who comes back from school, tired and with a lot of homework to do. If he goes to do that service, he might not do all of his homework. And if he stays late to night to do it, he will not focus the next day. So that will hurt the student from both ways. As my position was stated to you to read, my advice to you is; at least help some students get our of this difficult service. And if the community needs some help as stated; take them in a specific day during school. But if it's everyday, community service jobs should be announced. That way students have some time and also learn community service during school.

Many people all over the country volunteer for community service. They are doing the right thing and get a self reward feeling after their work is complete. To force someone to perform this would be unacceptable. Nobody would have fun being forced to do those things. I believe it would be better to just let people volunteer for doing good deeds. You see, when a group of people volunteer to clean up trash on the beaches they are looked at as good people because they are going out of their way and schedule to do something that benefits everyone.

Influencing students to perform community service would be a much better idea than forcing them to. I suggest you form a club of volunteers at school to go on field trips to perform community service. Such as going to a homeless shelter and bringing canned food or blankets. This way the students can perform community service the way they want to, and you get your community service performing students.

I think that you probably should not make students that do not want to, do community service. Some reasons are that they have sports and don't have time to spend inbetween their extracurricular activities and their schoolwork. They will, eventually, fall behind in school and will have to quit sports. They will work on their schoolwork, community service, and getting their grades up, instead of doing what they love. So, should you force students to do community service? I think not and here are three reasons why: they don't have the time, they want to spend time with their family, and they might feel like they don't have any rights.

Some kids lead very busy lives, in between schoolwork, family, friends, sports, debate teams, and so on, and so on, but kids do not really know how to distance their activities.

So if you force kids who don't want to do these things and they already have to much to chew, then eventually, they will have to give up something important to them in order to be able to complete the task that has been shoved down their throats.

4631AFEED2F7,"Dear Principal,

I think that what you are doing is wrong. Students should not be obligated to do community service if they do not want to.

I do know that community service is great for helping other people or just cleaning around, but some students do not want to do it and some have sports or other things to worry about and i just think it could cause so much stress to students. Community service should come from the heart no because one is obligated to do it , at least what you should do is tell the students that community service will give you extra credit , i am sure that many students will join immediately just because of that.

Here is one example why you should not make it mandatory for students to provide community service, well it would cause more stress to the students. Most students stress about homework, work at school , grades ,sports ,etc. , if they are obligated to provide community service then that would be just another thing to stress about , and i am sure nor you or the parents want to see a stressed or depressed child.

Another reason is because if students do community service it is because they want to, in order for you to provide some community service it has to come from your heart. The majority of students that did not want to provide community service will hate it and some may even hate you. Some students might even leave the school because of that. Some rebellious students might even mess up the work that others have done in the community because they feel they do not have to work.

I can give you many ideas though on how to get students to provide community service with out any obligation. For example provide a prize for the students that do more community service, that will have students provide more community service then they use to. Also you can give them extra credits for any class, the students will have credit for every day that they provide community service, the credits begin to stock up and the students will have the option to choose any class/subject that they want or need those extra credits for. As you can see i have some good reasons on why you should not make it mandatory, but if you feel like students need to provide more community service then use some of my ideas. As a student i think that if use you use at least one of those ideas that i stated then more students would join.

Community Service takes time needed away from Students.

Students may need to go home and help out, at Home.

So they can't really help out at school, for Community Service. Students need time at home to do homework, and learn in class. Example, like if they Come to School the next day, and they Didn't do their Homework, b/c of Community service it's not their fault, that their not

Doing their homework or that they don't understand how to do the homework without learning in class. Its actually taking lots of time away from their learning, and work time.

So they disserve what they get. I think community service would help the students more so they could teach him or her a lesson. Also students should learn how to help the community, by picking up trash around them even if they didn't drop it they should help the community. So i think students should be require to do community service.",2,Community service,Independent

I think people should have a choice of doing community service or not doing community service.

I think they should have a choice because no one knows how busy there life is after school. Some people are very busy after school and don't have time to do other work.

Some people have a lot of time after school and should do work to help the community.

If they do have time to do community work I think they should also be recognized with a certificate or something in that general area.

If they don't have time then they should work on freeing up there schedule for relaxing.

That is because no one likes an angry stressed out person.

If people want to do community work instead of serving detention I think they should be allowed to because after all they are helping the community, and it might be a punishment for them if they don't like to help out at all.

If people volunteer to help out the school as community work I believe that you should let them it will help make the outside of the school look better.

If someone wants you to help out i think you should get recognized for that to because adults don't get recognized for as much as kids do.

I also believe that if the school should allow a club or something to do community work if we have enough people that think it is that important.

I would also like to bring to your attention that some people are trying they're hardest to get out there and work but don't have the time I wish we had a class for that to so you can help them relax and not always be stressed out about it.

I hope you take my suggestions into consideration.

6B933220124E,"I think students should be required to do community service. Its a great way to appreciate the Earth, but also a good way to teach. For example, some students may like to go outside and get involved. Its a new experience of studying. Personally i love doing hands-on work, such as projects and building things.

The advantages are helping the planet and doing things for others. It makes an individual feel like they achieved something, it makes them feel good and have courage. community service is a great way to learn. You can get more involved, outside of school. You can get to know your neighbors or, who knows, you may just be a natural and open a window to a new career you never would think of. It'll give us knowledge that may be necessary in the future! Students should always keep an opened mind and take risks. Even if they don't like ""helping"", they should at least try it out. They wont know it, until they try it!

Now there are only a few flaws with this. For one, if its winter and you go outside, students may not like the cold weather (not likely), or maybe some students would not like the subject, or idea, of actually getting up, working and moving. Some may think its too boring or they don't want to tutor children. Doing community service may take time away from doing homework or take time away from activities we do outside of school

Overall, it depends on the person if they volunteer to help their community. But, I think its a great idea and we should do it. It'll be a new experience that'll somehow make me wiser and apply that knowledge later on in life.

I think that you should require all student to do a little community service, because of these three reasons. My first reason is that everyone should help out the community sometime it doesn't have to be a long hours, but doing so can build character. My second reason is that the community can benefit from this requirement if you put it into action. My third reason is most parents want student to help out around the house or neighborhood that can be classified as a sort of community service. I hope I have enlightened you on my insight to this matter. Again my three main reasons were one, everyone should help out in the community at least a little bit. Two, the community can benefit from this requirement if you put it into action. Three, most parents want student to help out around their house or neighborhood and for most parents this would make them happy to know that students are contributing to the well being of the community.

I think students should be required to perform community service, because it is very nice and considerate. Students would learn many things about helping people and they would learn about being an adult. When people perform community service it would keep them out of trouble and when they become adults they wont get into any trouble. Performing community service would make a person happy as well as yourself. Community service should be an elective at many schools and be required to graduate, so they can learn maturity when they enter high school and college.

Community service should be required because it helps high school students and junior high students gain maturity. It is very important because maturity determines what kind of student you are and what kind of adult you will be when you get older. Many students who do not have maturity and are often the ones that get into trouble. Community service helps you can maturity and get students out of trouble, because they would not like to distract any one from learning. Community service as an elective would be a good idea because they would like to help people and would care about others.",2,Community service,Independent

I agree with you i think making people do community service is good one example is because it would help our community a lot and it would be healthy. it would also keep people from doing bad things and more people would stop littering so other people won't have to pick their stuff they throw on the ground and people would also stop being lazy. People won't have to pick others up if you just throw your stuff in the trash and don't litter then people won't have to do community service so it's better to make people do community service till people will stop littering and being more responsible. People would also have more time if others stop littering and they would do what they want so they won't have to pick others trash up and have to throw it away for them. People would also be more kind to each other , children would stop doing it because if they litter they would have to do community service so they would get used to it and then they would stop littering. It's a good item to require community service and if you do require for students to do community service the community would be much better and more people would feel safe to be outside.",2,Community service,Independent
FBD852FCA5C1,"Dear principle,

I really don't think that making students do community service should be made a school requirement. Maybe a better thing that you can try to do with community service is maybe make a sign up sheet where all the students that actually want to help people and actually want to help their community can just sign up to do their community service to help. In my personal opinion there is no point on making students that don't want to help people or their community do community service at all unless they do something that is actually bad and have no other choice. The reason for why I think this way is because they probably won't even do a good job when doing it, won't feel good about them helping, and will just see no point in doing the community service that they have done. Also sometimes they have something that they absolutely have to do at their house or maybe it can be as simple as having to go somewhere that had a very important reason. Community service, it takes up your time and its usually from stuff that maybe they have been planning from maybe even a really long time ago and have been looking forward to this for a long time. Homework can also be an issue here sometimes. Maybe because they had to go to perform their community service thing they had to miss doing their homework or just didn't have time to do their best, and when kids sometimes miss their homework or just don't do their best in class, it can really drop their grade down by ALOT. Now I know you don't want community service or anything to come in the way of having a good education. So that is my personal opinion on the community service that you are planning on making a requirement and the really good reasons for my opinion.

A90048DEAF9A,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students now in 2011 haven't been helping out the community as much as they really should. If you make it a requirement to have students perform community service i think that it won't only help out our society but also change the minds of kids who think this is a punishment and instead think of it as a great way to help. Kids would gain more exercise by picking up trash on the grounds. They will be a help to many children younger than them if they tutor elementary kids. And they will help out our society way more if you require all students to perform a certain amount of community service a week or month.

I think that students being required to perform community service for a certain amount of hours is a good idea. By having students go outside and pick up all the trash outside of their school, near by a grocery store, or even park would help out not only our society but the students themselves. Students can gain a lot of exercise just by going outside for a walk. It doesn't matter whether they're just walking or doing a great thing for our world by picking up trash on the ground. Either way students are still getting energy and exercise out of this requirement.

Lately in Connecticut, our education scores have been dropping, more and more students are doing bad in certain subjects. If students with knowledge in a certain subject could tutor a younger student who is in need of help that would help us tremendously.

One student can make a difference in a school just by tutoring other students. This could help Connecticut scores move up from around the top 20 smartest states in the world to one of the top 5. Just like it was years ago.

Society today is not doing that well. More and more electronics are coming out so less and less people want to go outside get fresh air and help the community. If Principals start to require students to perform community service for a certain amount of hours than our society will look and feel 100 times better than before. Kids can start picking up trash helping people shovel in the winter to help others from causing crashes, and just helping whenever needed. This would definitely help out our society and the United States.

In conclusion I ,a former student at SCHOOL_NAME, think that it is a good idea if our principal starts requiring students to perform community service. If this happens children of all ages will help make earth better by going outside to pick trash up but also by getting exercise by being outside walking/looking for trash. They could tutor other children to make Connecticut one of the smartest states like it use to be. Also it'll help our society look and feel better than it ever has.

Community Service, wow, it is a great thing to do, but most of the time it isn't that easy and kids have homework and some kids might other important things to do. Which in this case I'm not saying community service is important, but kids have things to do so I believe community service should be a chose not a demanding decision made by others for you, because I feel if you don't chose your own community service then it's just like punishment. I would feel like a punishment because your doing something you don't want to do and it can or cannot be hard for you depending on your skills. Community service does help others, but if you automatically have to do it, such as being forced by someone to do community service it says a lot about their character. Even though, I feel community service is a lot of work on top of everything else a child has to do, i also believe that it is a good way to do good things no matter how much time you do it for.

I agree with my friends that community service takes too much time away from what

I need to do, but sometimes it's not even things that I need to do. Most of the time it's because we do homework and other things we need to do so much that when we have free time we just want to relax and have some fun because of the hard work and effort we put in to our lives and our work. Also as you may know, community service, sometimes is done to be placed as a punishment, so you giving us community service is like a punishment because we would have to do it or else a consequence. So for you to assign community service is ridiculous because we hard and do what we need to and no you want to add more hard work on top of that. Another reason, I feel that you assigning community service is despicable because in life we have to make our own choices. So, for you to make us help people is perplex to me. So if school is supposed to help us manage our life our self, then why would they make our decisions for us on what we do or things they feel we should do.

Lastly, I feel that community service will help the people it is required to help, but who will actually help us with the things we do in life and all the work we need to do. I understand we are helping people and that's a great thing, but we are going to be the unfortunate ones not getting help when we need it because of all the things we need to do.

Many people could help out other people, but the fact that really counts is the time and effort you put into doing it. So if you assign children their own ""Community Service"" then they won't put the right amount of time and effort, that the person they are helping is needed. So I believe if you want to give children community service let them have a choice or a voice in what they would have time for.

I think that you should have the students perform community service for an optional thing. They should decide if they want to do community service or not. But if you do force them to do the work for community service, will they try and give effort. Also will they have a bad attitude doing community service? I say that you should not require all students to perform community service.

First, they should decide whether they wont to or not. Everyone is not going to all do it, it's what they want to do. Some people like to do things for the community and some people don't like to. It is the right thing to do is to do community service, but you shouldn't force someone into doing it. If you do want to do community service, then do it. However, I am saying that you should require all students to do community service.

Secondly, if you do require all students to perform community services, will they try or give effort in what they are doing. I see people who do work and they don't give any effort in what they are doing. They slack off. Also it is hard for you to convince or persuade someone into working harder and that they are not even wanting to do it. I have some friends who perform community service because they like to and want to . My other friends think it is too much time away from what they need or want to do. The friends that say it's a waste of time are not going to give effort if they are doing community service if they have to do the work. So not everyone is wanting to do it, so you shouldn't require all students to perform community service.

Lastly, will there (the people who say it's a waste of time) attitude in working in community service last long if there working? Say if you sign everyone to picking up litter after school for an hour. Will the people who say it's a waste of time have a good attitude about working and picking up the litter. Some students will have a good attitude about picking up the litter will have a better moral than the others.

The most important part of why I am writing you this letter is that you should give the option on who will do community service or not. You shouldn't just say that everyone will or won't do community service. You should just give the option.

I think that kids should do community service because they benefit them in a lot of ways. A lot of kids spend their time playing video games or doing nothing. The community service will teach them how to do other things. Tutoring can help prepare for a carer in teaching because it gives the tutors patience. If they pick up litter they can promote others to help clean parks lakes and make a healthier environment for everyone.

Some of the community services can give people experience so when they get older getting a job can be easier. It can also give them responsibility like being in charge of a cleaning group. It gives them the leadership skills they may need to run a company or run a family. They will also get to know people of the community.

Some kids think community service takes too much of their time. I wont lie it does take some time, but some kids spend weekends doing nothing. Community service has a lot of options that they can choose from. Some kids like to ride bikes, so they can consider Meals-On -Wheels.

I think that student should be required to take part in community service because there are many benefits that can come from helping others. One of which can be learning a new skill or ability. One example could be if you are performing a service in an office like building you can learn the skills to be a good secretary. Also if you are performing an activity that requires a great amount of work such as delivering heavy packages you could improve your motor skills and become stronger an more fit. Another benefit that could come from community service could be improving your reputation around your community. If people that don't really know you see you helping others they may want to get to know you and might become friends with you. Performing community service can also make you a much better person. By this I mean that community service could teach you that there is much more you can do with your time after school than going onto Facebook, Aim, playing video games, and watching television. My last example is that community service could also improve the ability of a student to work together with others. If there are a group of people performing community service with each other the service could teach them to work as a team and to help each other out.

I think students should be required to perform community service.

I think they should do community service because not only are they helping out the elderly or disabled but they have a good mind of it when they grow up. In other words when they grow up their kids will follow their footsteps. Now some of my friends think it's really important and that others should do it. On the otherhand my other friends think it's a waste of their time. So we kind of had a debate about it and came across some reasons why we should and why we shouldn't perform community service.

Students should perform community service because they are helping out the community THEY live in. So its like helping a family member out and at the same time being polite and having manners. And some schools require community service. I know our school requires community service when you make it on to arista. But the problem is that when you actually make it onto arista you only need to perform community service if you want to be in the ceremony and be accepted into arista. I think community service should be required to graduate. That would have everybody making time for it.

Now the reasons other people don't want to do it is because they think it's not mandatory. And the other reason why they don't want to it is because they have no time and they need to do homework or study or they have practice for games.

Now it's not just test and homework now they must do double the work by helping other students with there school.

Some people might think that doing community service is mindless and stupid, but i think it's a great way to help people who don't have a well planned out education or who don't have a house or just cleaning up the environment. I help the community out by cleaning up litter, donating my old clothes to the poor, also by donating canned food to the soup kitchen and by recycling. The people who don't want to do community service don't have to, they can just help out by donating canned foods or just recycling cans. I think you don't have to make the students do community service if they don't want to. Just put up sign up sheets in the hallways and have people sign up on their own time or just create a group that cleans up the school grounds before or after school hours.

I have thought about your decision on whether or not students have to perform community service, and although community service is great, I believe that students should make their own decision. After all it is their time and they should choose what they want to do with it, some kids may want to perform the community service but some may want to be with their friends or simply doing another activity. Also take in mind that some kids are really unable to perform community service because they may have prior commitments and you can't just make them abandon that activity because it may be something that they absolutely have to do. You also may not know that some kids' parents may be working at that time so they must take care of their siblings. Community service is great and all but you have to take in mind that there may be a priority greater to some students than having to volunteer their time towards the community when they have other more important things to do. For some it will be their choice not to get involved helping the community be a better place but for others you cannot just simply require them to have to volunteer their time to not do something that would take away from their time that they may have needed to do something more important to themseves. So I tell you do not make community service a requirement for your school because there may be many people that cannot give their time to this cause.

I am all for community service. If students are required to do different services we will become a better community. Say, if 10 students pick up garbage around the community each day it will become cleaner. If we have students to tutor the younger children in elementary, we are sure to see there grades and scores change. Also, for them to do better in school.

I can also see how some students would not want to do this. Some students are dedicated to sports or clubs. Which means that they have school then practice/ meetings right after. Once they get home they have to do all there homework or study for a test. Understanding they have chores and other stuff to do at home. Some students do not have a lot of time at all.

If you really want us to help out our community you could make it a extra class for college credits or bonus for a class. Doing this would make students want to help out a lot more. It's a win, win situation. The community is becoming cleaner and more joined as a whole. While students are earning better grades and getting credits for college.

As you can see, our community and students can gain from this. It's just how we reward the students for there service. Of course, if you help them out with college or to get better grades they are going to want to do it. On the other hand if you don't reward them with anything, fewer students are going to want to help out the community.

Hi, my name is STUDENT_NAME and I attend your school.

I am in the 8th grade.

My opinion on community service is this! I think that community service is a great thing to do for someone even when you don't have to.

It takes putting others before yourself to do this.

I see it as an act of kindness. It shows that you care about other people and it also shows you using unselfishness!

Doing community service gets people to notice what you are doing even if you don't think that anyone notices. I have been in the position where me and a couple friends went to play with some kids at a park while their parent worked all day and the smiles on there faces puts a smile on mine. I never realized what I was doing for those kids by just hanging out with them.

By the end of the day, I didn't want to leave and neither did all the little kids. We had a blast and doing that made me feel good about myself!

I have also done other community service.

One time we went to the high school and made one-million meals for kids in Africa who are starving today.

Seeing everyone in one big room showing kindness and compassion while making those meals with a smile on their faces gave me chills!!

I think community service should continue because doing something for someone else makes you feel good and you never know what good you are doing for that person.

I've been hearing that you are thinking of whether to require students to perform community service and I personally think that it's a great idea. I agree on requiring all the students in our school to perform community service. Maybe I can turn your, maybe into a, yes.

Students are always up to no good during their own time. Not all the students, but some are. Most of them are out maybe doing drugs or involved in gangs, or maybe even stealing. students need to get away from all that and community service would be a great way to get them out of that. They need to learn that there is other people out there that need their help and instead of thinking about themselves, and doing bad things, they should be out there helping them, doing something good for somebody else besides themselves.

Community service is also another way to bring students and people together. Sometimes kids don't talk or know each other and maybe they don't seem to like each other, and I think a great way to bring everybody together is by helping our community and helping one another. We can make new friends while helping our community.

Another good reason to require community to all the students is to make our community a better and safer place. We can start by picking up litter from the streets and the freeways to not pollute the planet and make it a better community to live in so more people would want to come and live here, that will definitely help. We can stop global warming by ; picking up trash, throwing away our trash, recycling, everything. Students have a big part in that because most students don't really and seem to throw their trash on the floor and some don't even bother picking it up, they always have that habit, but only if they can see how it's harming the earth.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service is a major need for our society. We need it to keep highways and parks clean. Without it, the parks green grass would die, and our highways wouldn't be used because of trash backups. What's even worse is that they pour half of it into lakes, ponds, streams, and especially the ocean. The animals occupying them are dying, in their own homes! I suggest that we start a program in our school to help save the environment from those who litter.

I think we should start with our local parks, maybe during an elective class, or after school. Then we could make posters, signs, and flyers to spread the news of what we're doing. Then others from our community could start helping us keep our environment clean. I believe that students will enjoy keeping our parks clean, so that they, and kids to come, may enjoy them. Keeping the environment clean, is an important job for everyone, including kids.

If adults teach their children to believe that littering is bad, and not to do it, littering will cease to exist. Everyone wants a nice world to live in, but the world is just like a plant, or maybe a pet. We need to take care of it. Without our love, and care, the pet, in this case, the planet, will die. We need to feed it, keep it clean, and never neglect it. Otherwise, our home, planet Earth, will die out, just as other extinct animals.                  ",2,Community service,Independent

Community service is a great way for kids to express their selves in so many ways. But for some kids, community service isn't what its all thought out to be.

Some kids don't have the opportunity to do anything outside of school. I know i have a ton of homework and to top that off, i have three different sports i have to do consecutively after school. I like your thought about assigning ever student with community service, but i wouldn't expect getting a positive response back. Only the matter being, kids love to play and do what they want to do. So unless they choose to help outside of school with the community, i doubt they would want to help.

On the other hand, there are kids who would love to show their affection for their community by doing whatever is possible. Maybe putting a sign outside of school for people to sign up to help out the community would be a good idea. Not only that, but there are people who need discipline. Or some people who don't show up to school very often as needed, should get service hours to make up the hours they haven't attended school. That would be a great way to get more kids to do community work! As for tutoring kids, im sure that's also considered as ""community service"", and i know a few people that are wonderful at almost every curricular subject. We could pay those students to tutor others, i know kids love money these days, im sure they'd take the opportunity if they got the chance.

On your thought about assigning EVERY student community service is a little absurd. I'm one of those students who wouldn't want to do what i wouldn't want to do after school or none the less, on my own time. Only because, i have important things to do on my own time. Like doing homework, sports, and getting caught up with my friends. Community service, i think, is a wonderful thing to do, for people who actually have the time and effort to do it.",3,Community service,Independent

Community service is a great way to help others in need in the community, hence the name community service.

Also, community service would help to make the community a better place.

It would be a great idea to require students to perform community service to give something back to the community they belong to.

Most students perform community service on their own without being required, so it would only effect them in one positive way.

These students would be recognized for their hard work that prior to the requirement would have been ignored.

Requiring community service will also make the school look better because most students would be well-rounded, something colleges look for in students.

Being a well-rounded student will help them get into colleges because if they can participate in the community, keep up their grades, and do a sport, they are practicing good time management, a necessary skill in the later years in school as well as in the workplace.

Helping the community is very important and can even be enjoyable.

As long as students are able to pick their own project, it is more than likely they will enjoy participating in the community.

My friends who are involved in community service think it is very important, and so do I.

Some of those friends wish they were recognized, but don't want to bring that up because they don't want to say it in a way that they are only doing it for the recognition.

If all students were doing community service, the community would be a much better place.

Some students honestly think community service is just a distraction from what they want or ""need"" to do.

These students most of all need to be required to do some community service because they are not well-rounded students and they should be shown what it's like to do community service.

They have no idea what it would be like if nobody picked up litter or helped tutor elementary school children.

These children who were neglected in the sense of education would not know what's going on in school and both the student and the school would suffer.

Eventually, choosing to not do community service will catch up with them and penalize them specifically, weather it's in college or when the school district does not perform it's best on tests like the NAEP and the MEAP, and the school district is rated lower than it was previously and teachers are forced to take the school day reviewing concepts the incoming students were supposed to have prior to that class.

With all due respect,

I believe having community service for our school is just what we need, to put those in help to work. I love to do community service, it will help those in our community who can't do things on their own. Some of my friends are involved in this work, and will offer some good things we can do to help. But some of my other friends are not involved and i wish to help them, by getting their minds thinking positive about what they will be doing. If we maybe take just one day off of school, and take a bus ride to a place that needs taking care of and help every month or so, we all can make a difference in our community. We will be a role model to all the younger students in our school. You could take maybe, just the 8th graders first to some where and see how it goes in community work, and if it goes smoothly we then could take the older grades to somewhere and help them coupe with their problems. This could be very good for our school issues, then maybe if all goes smoothly, you could then every month take one day off of school and have it community day for everyone. But then everyday be a different community work day for 8th through 12th grades. Also if you are trying to think of some ideas of where we could go to do our community work, you could maybe set up a board outside of the lunch room, that students can write some ideas of their favorite places that we could take care of. This community work idea is a great way to get students out of drugs, and many other harmful things. Also this is one great way to get those students a way to get community work on their record for their colleges. Community Service Day would be an awesome idea. My friends and I are just looking for the right way for students, to get away from a stressful day of school and do something that will help our future someday and somehow.

Community service is a good thing to do but some kids like the watch other people clean up after them. For example you are with a bunch of your friends and you drop a candy bar rapper and you see it there on the ground but you don't pick it up and put it in the trash. The right thing you should of done was to pick it up and put it in the trash. Some people like to do community service because it makes them feel good and it helps other people in the presses. Kids think it takes to much time out of spending time with there friends. But what if you got a bunch of your friends together and started picking up around your community together. I think community service should be optional, because if it was required it would take to much time out of sports and other after school activities. But i also think students should be required to perform community service around the school during school hours, because if students did that the schools campus would be a much better place to play sports on and hang out on. I don't thing community service takes to much time, if i see a piece of paper on the ground i pick it up and pit it in the trash.",2,Community service,Independent
A9CB53645FC9,"Dear Principal,

I think everyone should have to do the community service. I think it is important for kids to be involved in that kind of work. It helps the community they live in and it helps them. If they did community service they would be able to put that on their things to get into college. It would help them get a better education and it would help the community stay clean.

Kids and people both say that they don't have time because they are busy. They are busy doing what they want to do, not what they have to do. There is a difference! I am not saying that it is bad to do what you want sometimes but it's good to help out on your community. People that drive by throwing things out the windows are wrong. But we can make it clean if we just pick up a few things. If we had everyone working on it then each person wouldn't have to pick up that much. Kids and people need to learn that they can have fun and do what they want but also pick up and make the community look nicer.

If you are one of the ones that is picking up then you need to get your friends to help out. You need to get all your friends together and help make your community a better place to live in. I think you, principal of this school should get them to learn that because if we could get friends and even parents to help out then I think we could make it beautiful outside. There is only one way to do that though, and that's to get everyone picking up around here. Don't only get kids but get parents too. Parents can help out even though they are not at the school. Simply telling them to stop throwing things out the window will help some.

For all the reasons I have listed, I think you should make everyone help pick up. They are not too busy that they cant help the community. They can separate the hours they do what they want, what they have to do, and the time they spend making the place they live in a better one. Send out a letter saying that they need your help. Not just the kids but the parents too. Picking up the litter doesn't only save the land, but if you live by an ocean is saves the sharks, dolphin's, and many other water creatures. One person can't make all the difference, but getting everyone together and all helping out can. Anything is possible when you have everyone working for it.

I would just like to tell you my opinion about community service. I think that you should require all students to perform community service. I think that it would be a good idea because there's always people in the world that would love to have help from other people and also just making the community nicer, and cleaner. I think most kids our age would rather go home and go to sleep, or just go home and watch television, but I think community service would really help the community a lot. You should have flyers all around the school telling kids to do community service. I bet if it seemed fun to do, than maybe they would like to. Most kids would probably do community service because there friends were doing it with them, that would also inspire kids to help out a lot if they were doing it with there friends. For some people, they already have to do community service for religion, and other things, but i still think you should make community service seem fun, so kids would actually want to be a part of it. You should also go around to all the teachers and tell the teachers to talk to their students about helping out. Sometimes, if you hear something from your favorite teacher you would like to do it. Well, at least that's what i have to say. I strongly believe that kids in our school would love to do community service, it would probably make them feel better about themselves because they either helped out someone, or helped out something. Just spending a half an hour on community service two or three times a week could make a big change for the environment. Also, when kids do community service, they could also be helping a little kid do better in school and that's a very kind thing to do. I just think telling you this would change things in our school and also change things in other peoples lives. If kids just did community service for about 2 hours every time they do, they could still go home after and do what they want or need to do. Well, I hope you take my advice. I believe that it would be an amazing thing to do for people around the world. That's all i have to say! Have a good day.

4575B9D207C5,"Well people should pick up litter and i am going to tell you why:

First when your community looks bad other people don't want to live in a bad looking community.

All students should take some part in preventing littering, but the principal should make a list of which group of people who should do it every week and not all students can take part in community service because of the fact that some students have some form of after school activities and sports.

Only those that agree to work in community service should do it.

If u do this every week we could get this community looking good in no time.

There should not be any elementary kids picking up litter on the side of the road only kids 13 and up should be picking up litter on the side of the road.

If some one gets hit by a car the parents could sue the school for making there child pick up litter.

That is the downfall of the subject because if a child gets hit the school would be responsible for what happens to the kid and the principal would have to tell the parents why their kid is dead.

That is all i have to say about the subject",3,Community service,Independent
CD0C46A0B2E6,"In my opinion I believe that students should not do community service for a plethora of ways. One way i believe that students should not do community service is because they do stuff to help the community in there everyday activities. Students recycle paper and throw away trash. There are many people already doing community service. For a child it is like punishment to do community service because its taking time out of there own lives to pick up trash. Although some parts of community service is expectable. Maybe once a every two months the students could go to a community center and help the homeless, such as feed them and talk to them. But it should be in school time since a person only has one life to live, and they better make the best of it. It would be fun helping the community with your friends, but not alone. Both of the elementary children and my friends are right. It is for a good cause, but it does take time out of what we wish to do.",2,Community service,Independent

I am writing to you today because of the issue of community service, it has become apparent to me that some kids are not on board with the idea of it and think its to much work for to little pay-out. How-ever I do not agree with them, the kids that say these things are the slackers they are board at school don't do their home work get bad grades and so-on, but community service is a good thing to do it helps other people and you get good karma for it. I do think that kids should be able to chose how much they do with a minimum amount of 3 hours. This would let the kids who challenge themselves continue to do so, and let the slackers become more used to the idea of work. Now i' m not saying that there isn't a little bit of slacker in every one but to be successful in the job market these day you want to be a hard working individual who doesn't mind doing something for others. Community service will get the idea of that in their head and hopefully send them on the right path through life.

21750F35CEF4,"My Response towards this is going to be towards the future of our community our world and everyone's future. In my response people who do community service are thinking in the right way they have their priorities straight and our thinking towards our future.

The people who do not do community service in my opinion just aren't thinking in the right way in word as saying they aren't thinking about our future about how us the children the kids are and will be the future of our planet we will have to manage it we are the one who will be making rules soon who will be sitting down in a desk of discovering something new or currying diseases. We have to get our priorities straight and think how we can make our world a better and safer place for our offspring and their own offspring. Though as we do community service we are helping our environment we are helping our community, we will not have a littered a polluted world we live in that is just mediocre. We are the future and we have to make it better starting now.

Have you seen how bad our world is we have war fighting over dumb reasons. We fight over land over money over oil, we should not even be fighting we did not come toward this earth to fight but as we make it we do. The human race is dumb they do not see what we are causing with the fighting, we are killing families we are breaking our own human races into different categories we should not be doing that. This all comes toward the subject of community service as i show if we fight we kill and if we kill we have less people for doing good deeds as community service. If we go to war we use transportation we destroy our earths ozone with the pollution we are causing.

In my ending statement is that we need to put all the bad things aside of what we really need to do. We need to help the poor as for education help all the countries around the world that are to poor to afford a proper education. We need to be clean to not kill our earth we need to just all come together and just help and come together to save our world to become a better place to accomplish more.

stay out of trouble. If we did not have community service some of the kids in our community would not get tutored and our parks would be a mess. Community service also helps our community in many other ways. With out our volunteers we would not have a lot of thing like the boys and girls club the fresh produce garden right around the corner and our very own Christmas tree farm.

42933710EB6E,"Dear Principal,

I believe that you should require community service for high school credits. It is a good opportunity for students to learn to help others rather than only care for themselves. I think that it will be a unique experience and people would feel rather happy with what they have done.

Many of my friends believe that doing community service is a waste of time and that they need time for what they want to do, but in my opinion, that is selfish and wrong. Community service gives you a pat on the back and you feel important to someone, something or someplace.

There are many accessible ways to do community service. Tutoring is one way. Tutoring someone could lead them to their future, and leading the path to someone's future is something that they will never forget and always thank you for. Another way to help out your community is to pick up trash from places like the beach, the park and around where you live. Picking up litter from these places will keep animals out of the danger-zone and little kids safe.

A super easy way to help out is donating old clothes to the Salvation Army. You're not going to wear them anymore, so might as well let someone! You could also bake something sweet for homeless shelters. All of these ways are in reach and you would be making someone feel very special.

You could hold a book drive for an orphanage. You could turn in your old books or your childhood favorites and maybe they would be someone else's favorite. You could give old clothes, books and other things as presents for orphans for Christmas every year. Just one day every year would make someone feel special for life!

And that is why I think you should require community service. Students should know that if they were in certain situations and they could not do anything about it, someone like them might have been there to help. A sense of accomplishment comes with community service. The biggest compliment there is is to have someone say ""Thank you"" with a smile.

Although people say they don't have the time to do community service, that is just an excuse for not wanting to do some work for our community. You should definitely take action and have SCHOOL_NAME students do community service work, at least a few hours a week, so SCHOOL_NAME, and SCHOOL_NAME can become a much better community.

The students here at SCHOOL_NAME are definitely capable of working hard. They do it every day at school, and even at home. So there is absolutely no excuse they can say, that can keep them from doing some work for our community. Some excuses might be, "" I have too much homework to do after school"", or "" I already participate in many after school activities, isn't that enough""?

There are even many more excuses made than that. If they want to make excuses, maybe you could have them do a couple more hours of work. And for the

Because students are fully capable of doing good for their community.

Since you are principal of our school, you do a lot of things for SCHOOL_NAME, like giving the students a safe learning facility. The students can at least also do the same as you, because we then will not only be giving back to Wauwatosa, we would also be giving back to you. We can do any kind of jobs, that kids are capable of, anyways. For example, we can rake the leaves in fall, or shovel driveways for our neighbors. We could even collect canned goods for the hungry and poor. We can do little and big things, but still give back to you, and give back to Wauwatosa.

If you make SCHOOL_NAME students perform community service, I can guarantee that not only SCHOOL_NAME, but our school will be a much better place. The students will not be as rowdy, and more kids will pick up trash laying on the floor in hallways. For example, when a student drops something, more students will take action to return it to them.

I would like to let you know how I, and many others feel about volunteering and community service.

I believe it should not be required but should be kept as a free choice.

I feel volunteer work as a required task would give it less value because of the reason behind the good work.

I believe community service does benefit the community and many people in different ways.

Some people need their time for school work and for their own daily lives and volunteer work may disrupt their schedules and routines.

Some people have a hard time with other activities, and volunteering for other service activities limits time for their own commitments.

I believe the best solution to let students experience community service, is to always have the options open.

Also, the school can bring volunteering and community service into its student programs such as with fundraisers.

I think that community service should be required for all students. Community service is a good way of giving back to the community. It can also help you to form new bonds and friendships with the people you work with or work for. Community service can be a very fun activity and give the other students a chance to begin to like community service. Community service helps you to grow as a person and grow in relationships.

Community service can help your community to grow together. When my brother was on his new travel hockey team, as a way of getting to know each other and give back, the went to OTHER_NAME. I ended up going with them. To see how much can be accomplished, just in a few short hours with about 30 people was absolutely insane. To think that so much can be done in such a short time really makes you think about how much could be accomplished if we had 50 or maybe 100 people working together. If we could get even 100 people together, we could make a big difference and change something.

Service work helps you to grow in interpersonal relationships. In my experience of going to OTHER_NAME, I made some new friends and started bonds that probably would have never started with out it. The whole team was closer together. We had to work together and communicate, to better help ourselves get the work done. Those relationships lasted throughout the next 3 seasons together. The boys, on the ice, had lasting friendships and accomplished more as a team instead of just one player. In hockey, and really any sport, you can't have the offense without defense and you need to be able to trust each other. Trust in the start of all relationships.

I wasn't really sure what to expect when I first started working at OTHER_NAME. MY mom forced me and my little brother to go. When we got there and started to watch the videos on who we were helping and the cause that we would be supporting, it really made me start thinking about how lucky I was to have such a kind loving and caring family that is wealthy and can afford food, clothing, and every extra thing that I do. So many people across the whole world, are SO much less fortunate than me. I have everything I could ever want and more. Half of the things that I have, I'm sure I don't need, but I still begged for them at one point. Now, I see that none of those things are important or even make me happy.

If other students get to feel the joy I feel, even for a minute, by helping someone and know that YOU are saving a good someone's life, they would definitely change the way they feel about community service. I can't wait to go on the next community service project trip and look forward to helping my community. One person can stand alone and fight for what they believe in, but accomplish nothing because they have no one standing beside them, cheering them on and supporting them. You really start to loose hope and motivation, when you know that you are alone. I want to make a difference, and so do the other students, they just don't know how to.

Community service is life changing and I absolutely recommend that we do it. There would be less bullying and fighting, because you would feel at peace with yourself and your community. You would know that YOU mad a difference and are on the way to changing the word. I play many athletics and am in all sorts of clubs and activities, and with each one, I try to get everyone involved in community service. It is so important!

Even though hope is sometimes bleak, we need to keep the faith and courage to keep going and keep trying to change. When we are turned down and rejected, we need to let it roll off our backs and keep going on. People do not like change and will do anything to stop it, but if you firmly believe that what you are doing is right, keep going and pushing towards it. I hope that this letter helps you to see how big of a change our school could make. If just our small community could change, it would make a difference to everyone around us and persuade them to change too. We would

I understand that you are deciding whether or not to make community service a school requirement. This is a big decision for the school and its students and you must look at the perspective of some of the students.

I myself find community service appealing and would enjoy have it as a school requirement, but I believe making it a requirement for all students is not a smart idea. Some of the students have jobs they have to do after school and do not have the time to do community service. An example of one of the jobs that students may have is to watch their siblings after school while their parents are working.

I believe community service should be required by all students. So I think that students who already have too much food on their plate should have to bring in a parent or guardian to say in person that schoolwork, homework, and community work is too much for their child to handle. This way a smart student will not be given a bad grade because they did not fulfill the required community service.

This is what I believe and what I think should be done about required community service. Thank you for taking the time from your day to hear my words and I do hope that they have helped you decide on what to do in relation to community service.

Hi.

I am an eighth grader at your school.

And I am going to propose an opinion on whether or not the whole school should be required to do community service or not.

My answer will be supported with examples and other forms of evidence.

I think that you should not make everyone do community service.

There are plenty of people who should do it and people who cannot do it.

Many teens these days play sports and have families to attend to.

Although everyone SHOULD do it, doesn't mean they can do it.

I, for example, can't because of baseball.

I play in two different leagues and I am trying out for the school team.

There are many others who are just like me and just can't even if they wanted to.

The people that do have time to do it are doing good for our society and so it does not mean that everyone must contribute.

Also, if you think about it, a lot of teens, especially eighth graders, will not want to do it at all.

Teens these days just aren't caring for our economy, society, etc.

And if you do not listen to me and make everyone do it anyway, there will be protesters and you never know what they might do to get you to stop it.

It is great if people want to do it but like i said before, not everyone wants to or they just cannot have the time to help out.

Thank you for taking your time to read my (hopefully convincing) letter to you.

And that you please consider the possibilities of what might happen if you do go through with your plan.

Sincerely,

I think that community service is not a waste of time, because people care about where they live. They want to keep it clean so that when family and relatives come over and visit they might want to stay a little bit longer because parts of the city is so clean. Also, it gives a good reputation to the city. Then big time celebrities would want to stay in the city for a little bit if they have a concert or something like that. Community service is a good idea because it makes you feel better about yourself when you go somewhere and you see that the city is all clean. Also if kids do community service then they will also have a good reputation, because you will be one of the kids that helped make the city look good. Other kids don't want to do community service because they think it is a waste of time. They would rather sit on the couch every day eating potato chips and watching T.V instead of going outside and working and helping your community. Community service can build friendships and help bond with your family and spend time with them more.

But instead of making all the students do community service, you should make it were you give kids do community service for extra credit for some of their classes that their struggling with. That will help them a lot. But some kids think that it is just a waste of time and they say that they have more important things to do. Also I think that we need to start a community garden. I think it is a good idea, because everybody can just help out and talk to each other and make new friends. We can grow plants together. And when vegetables and fruit are ready to be picked we can take them home and someone can make a pie",2,Community service,Independent

All students go to school to give them the skills they need for there future. Knowing that i think that students should be required to do community service to help there future because community service provides a good look in the society and because it helps them learn how to do more great things.

To start off, I think that students should be required to do community service to make good in our society. Couple of months ago my friend volunteered to help clean up the beaches after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. My family and i thought of going down there to help them out.

When we got there, we saw a bunch of people volunteering. I never thought so many people would do all this work for free. I ask my friend and he said because we wanted to make the world better. Maybe if we volunteer in our society we might make the world better for us and others. 6/10 volunteers, volunteer to help the society stated by the Federal Volunteering Committee.

Volunteering should be required in our school because it helps society and it make it easier for others.",3,Community service,Independent

I think it is very important to perform community service.

It means that our school is involved in the environment.

If there is litter in our school, some of the kids could help clean it up.

It would make our school more presentable.

I think it should be an option and maybe there would be a reward at the end of the year for the person that performed the most acts of community service.

Some people actually like to perform acts of service because it makes them feel good about themselves.

They like the feeling of helping someone out.

It gives them a certain feeling inside.

It gives them great satisfaction to realize the job that they did.

On the other hand, some people are selfish and they don't like to help those in need.

They have other commitments that maybe are more important.

Other activities also take time and commitment and maybe performing community service is too much.

They would much rather hang out with friends and do other things rather than help the environment.

I think we should take time out of our day to look around our surroundings and see if we see any trash laying around.

If so, we would take a minute to stop and look around.

These little acts of service mean so much.

Even though they are so little, they can lead to something big.

Whatever you decide to do, I am fine with.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration on this subject.

Sir, I do not believe that the students at the school should be required to participate in community service. Although it would serve as good character building for some, many students simply would not have the time to do the allotted amount. I do believe that it would make a great extra credit opportunity, but it is simply too time consuming to be a requirement. the simple fact is that the average student nowadays has a lot more to do than just school. In this economy many are having to take care of siblings while their parents work so they don't lose their house. While not everyone is unable to do the tasks, I do not believe it is fair to make those who are already stressed work even harder. Perhaps an alternative type of program could be set up, such as a reward for doing a certain amount of volunteer work or points added to a grade, but it should not be required.

Another reason I believe community service should not be required is because if it is required, it somewhat loses the character building aspect. Instead of feeling proud for volunteering to help out, students would more than likely resent being forced into the work. they would more than likely not work as hard and just finish the job just for the purpose of finishing it, rather than being happy to help the community and working as hard as they can. All in all I believe that community service should be kept as volunteer work, and not be required.

Community service, it does a lot of good. But, let me ask you this, if your students are required to have to participate in community service, and they are forced to do something they are not willing to do, does it really do as much good as if they chose to do it out of the kindness of their hearts?

Many of your students may already be doing community service, which is a wonderful thing. At the same time, many of your students may not be doing community service. That is their choice. If they would rather play basketball, or video games, or whatever they want to do instead of help out others, it should be their decision. As much as I believe community service is a good thing, you don't know what the students are doing instead of this. For all you know, they could be helping their families out at home, or getting active and playing sports, maybe even studying for their school work, If you take away their free time, you just may be causing negative effects on your students learning.

On the other hand, these young adults may be doing things that are irresponsible and foolish with their free time. They could be making wrong decisions, causing trouble, or they could even be making a mess of the environment. Which is where I see your point, community service is good for a young adult, but, if they wish to go out and have ""fun"", however they may pursue that to be, you should let them. They are your students, and are only your responsibility while they are at school for academic purposes. Let their parents teach them valuable life lessons on their own. Even if it means that these young adults may have to make some wrong decisions to realize which ones are right.

In my opinion, requiring your students to perform community service just does not seem appropriate. They are old enough to decide on what is wrong and what is right. If they make the wrong decision, they will learn a lesson. Many times like this will occur in a person's life. You need to just let them live, because life goes on. They will know what to do.

So hopefully after you have read this letter, you will consider the effects of requiring your students to do something unnecessary, that may or may not help our community. Or letting them decide for themselves, and letting them figure out what they should or should not be doing. Thank you.

There are many different opinions about community service. Some individuals think you should be required to do it, but the others may think opposite. In my own opinion, I believe that you should have the option on whether or not to do community service. Helping people and the community is very important, but some people don't have the time to do so.

Some people may have sports, while others may have all the time in the world. It would be great to encourage students to take part in it at least once a week, or maybe even once a month, but not everyday. Most children enjoy fun activities, and to some of the children this is not fun.

If you require students to perform community service, there would be a lot of complaints. You might even have children not liking school or doing things they are not supposed to.

I think we should encourage students that they can make their own decisions to prepare them for the future. Forcing them will not do any good.

I do agree that community service is very good, and many people should take part in it, but some people just don't enjoy doing activities as such. Would you like being forced to take part in an activity you didn't like? I wouldn't.

I hope you take my opinion to good concern. I presume that you would be happy with just making community service an option. I will be happy with whatever you choose, but just know that making it an option will develop good reactions.

I understand that some people in this world do not care about our community at all, but it is very important to at least try to change it. Requiring students to do community service will make keep our community a clean and safe environment. Therefore, I believe that community service should be required for students at school not everyday, but at least maybe twice a week.

By doing this, you and everyone else who participates in this should be rewarded, but at the same time take responsibility to keep on making this place better for everybody. Some students may help with tutoring other students who needs help with schoolwork or something along the lines of that. Other people go around picking trash up of the ground and putting it where it belongs and trying their best to keep our environment clean.

Today, we still have people going around throwing trash on the grounds. I myself, have experienced people putting trash on the grounds and leaving it there. It hurts me because everyday I look at how much work people put into making schools, office buildings, restaurants, and etc. I hope that you have learned a lot from this and go along with requiring students to do community service no matter what it is they are doing.

Some kids don't do anything around the house. There are also kids who don't help out the community; they would rather stay at home and just hang out with friends. That is why

I believe that you should require all of the students at our school to do community service. There are so many kids that just sit inside all day and play video games and watch television. They can be a big help to the community if they help out in any way. After you perform community service, you always feel like you have done something good for the community. That feeling is incredible, and makes you want to keep doing good things.

There are many ways that kids can do community service. Kids of our age don't do community service on their own because they think it's boring and a waste of time. Those kids think that community service is just picking up trash on the highway, or having to donate money to a charity. There are many ways that kids can do community service, ranging from going to work with a parent or helping out at the school. I even know some friends that go to work at the soup kitchen so homeless people can have food. They say that it's very fun because they are all together. They also like to see the look on homeless peoples faces. They are always grateful and happy when they get their food.

Certain kids do not want to do community service because it conflicts with their schedules. It also a waste of time to them. People don't know that community service can be done, but enjoyed at the same time. I was in a Leadership class where I had to do ten hours of community service. At first I was frustrated and kind of dubious of what I should do. I later found out that I can work at places that I love to be. I went to help out my cousin over the weekend at the basketball court because he asked me to help his team. I went and I enjoyed it because I love basketball and have a great knowledge of it.

Because kids think it is boring and a waste of time, they don't do community service. The kids that never do community service will regret it for the rest of their lives. My dad's work is the top donating business in San Bruno. They are also donate the most time doing community service. Because of that, they have built trust with many people around the United States, and his business is very successful. Community service comes from the heart. It takes a real human being to skip an hour of time being with his friends to do some community service.",5,Community service,Independent
03BC86ED932A,"Dear Principal:

I, as a student at your school, personally believe that the completion of community service should be a requirement in our school system.

I believe there are many causes that could greatly use our help.

Not every student in our school will agree, but several also may.

Younger students could very much enjoy our help, with their school work, or just being a mentor to them.

There are several students who do not have anyone they can positively look up to, and could use a good influence in their lives.

Also, our city could immensely benefit from our work that could be done.

For example, we could clean up the litter around the neighborhoods, fix the playgrounds and parks, or simply improve the looks of things.

Don't you agree this would be an amazing ordeal?

Imagine the city after our school improved it.

Think of all the children who could be helped and encouraged, in many ways, with our works.

There are more ways than just these, as well.

Students could volunteer to assist in putting together care packages for those in need.

Also, we could work shifts at soup kitchens and places, to feed those who can not provide for themselves.

Many things can be done in our community.

I believe that without the encouragement, many of today's young people will not involve themselves in these activities.

This is why I believe the right thing to do is to make it a necessary requirement that each student participate in an amount of community service work.

After all, not only would these things benefit the others in the town, but it would also benefit for us, as the students here, too.

Let us not forget the greatness such acts would bring to the teachers, in every school within the area, as well.

The younger grade level teachers would receive much help from us, if we were to be there for the students, as a tutor, role model, or anything.

Then, once the students reach the level that we are now, you, as principal, and all your staff, could also benefit from the same children when they become your students, in a short amount of time.

From the words I have given, please consider creating the plans for a community service requirement within our school system.

I think that the principals shouldn't make all the students to perform community service, because maybe it would be good for other people, but some students don't have the time to do that, because maybe they need to take care of their little brother when their parents are going somewhere and can't take the children with them, and they don't have the money to pay a babysitter or the don't have any related to take care of them. Maybe the students don't want to do it, because they can't do it, because they want to hang out with their friends, go to the movies, or go to the park and play some kind of sport, or maybe they want to hang out with their girlfriend. If you make all the students to do community service, some are not going to go, because they got to take care of the little kids, or because the don't want to and that's going to cause more problems in the school and the students are going to get detention, because they didn't do their community service. Also if you force them to do community service its like they don't have no rights to make their own decisions. Maybe some students want to do community service, but that doesn't mean that all the student should be doing community service.

When it comes to community service there are many opinions. Some people may think it's a waste of time, others may believe that everyone should participate. Community service helps everyone including ourselves. For example if we help repaint a local play ground then everyone could enjoy a place were people go to relax and have fun with their children. People don't go to a park to look at graffiti.

Community service may be a choice but if students were required to perform community service then the students may be able to see what they're doing for their community. A majority of students would be upset if it would be held after school and many parents and staff would be upset if it was held during school hours.

I believe that school should make a hour for students to do community service that could benefit the school if possible. If community service was held during school for the school I think that many people would be able to agree that it would benefit almost every one. Students would learn to appreciate what our parents are paying for with their taxes and the nice school that we have, the staff wouldn't have to go around covering up graffiti in our bathrooms that students made, and our parents would be happy that we put aside other things to help out our community. So if you would make it a requirement for us to do community service then many people will be thankful for just the little change you made that helped a wide range of people.

81EFE876B2CE,dear principle i think students shouldn't do community service because it takes time away from things they have to do like school work or after school activities its not a bad idea but my opinion is that you shouldn't have students doing community service for example if theres a student that don't have good grades and needs to catch up having to do community service wouldn't help at all and the student wouldn't have time to catch up. another example is that students like to do after school activities like play sports and do other things and if every student was required ton do community service there wouldn't be time for after school activities or time to catch up on homework or missing work. but we can also benefit from it because then our school would always be clean and helping younger students with there work is also a good idea because that makes the older students feel good about helping younger students and putting a good example so when they get to middle school they will make good choices and have good grades. but my final decision is no every student should not be required to do community service.,2,Community service,Independent

I do think that community service should be required to all students. I say this because that more that we do around the community, it will keep us children even adults well rounded. To assure that we will be doing our certain amount of community service, you should have a list of options that we can have so that we can do something we know will be interesting. Also the more we help out it will be helpful to those who cant help themselves or the elderly, or even more gentle babysitting. I do see that other children may have things going on in their lives like sports or family. the reason of me saying this it could and probably will keep most children out of trouble as well as, keeping them well rounded or just helpful.

I have heard that many students are arguing on whether community service should be done by the students and i just wanted to share my opinions with you to help your decision.

Community service, i believe, is a great way to help people who need assistants and it helps us become better people. There are many things us as students can do such as: reading to the elderly, babysitting, and picking up litter from the parks or streets but also children like to have time to do fun things.

Children always want to have fun by playing with toys, going to a boiling alley, or going to see a movie but life in my eyes has to have a little responsibility and in what better way than to help other people in community service.

I, as a student, have always done community service because it makes me feel like i have accomplished something important and because i have helped my community in someway while also having fun. So my conclusion to you would be that children should be requested to do community service but not so many hours were it takes the away the fun in life.

First reason why i think we should be able to do community service is cause it looks good on our back ground. So suppose you go to a athletic school and they look at your background to see if your good enough or did anything good an if they seen you done nothing they wouldn't want you. Don't you believe if you were to have that you've done community service our a period that you'll get more acceptince letters than you having nothing on you're back ground.

Second reason i think we should be able to perform community service is cause it cleans our community. Really who wasn't to live in an neighbor hood with trash every where i wouldn't so why let us walk around in trash roaming the streets, why let it when we can do something about it. We could clean up and make neighbor hoods a safer environment for our kids, so you wont have to worry bout them goin out side playing with open canes.

Last reason why i think we should be able to do community service is cause it brings our community closer. Who wants to wake up 3 in the morning to see a face you never seen before but that same face lives rite in front of you, or you come home to see your kids in the house every after noon because they don't have friends or they don't no any body. I remember the time i stayed in the house cause i had no friends and it wasn't fun. if we clean up together everyday we'll start making friends and having fun cleaning every day with formiller faces then you wont have to stay in the house cause you have no friends now you can go outside so absolutely wouldn't you want us to do community service.

In conclusion we should have community service cause it looks good on our back grounds, it cleans our community, and it brings our community together. So now do you see why i want our school to have community service.",4,Community service,Independent

I am writing this to tell you my feelings about community service. I strongly feel that students should be required to do community service. I think that students should not have to do community service at pre scheduled times because as a teen i know that i like to hang out with my friends. Also, you never know what emergencies should come up in the future. I think that students should be able to do the community service within a time limit but at their own pace. Also, I think they should be able to pick when they want to work. I would like to see someone doing community service with the elementary school kids, like being tutors or reading to them. I would also like to work with the local recycling company, recycling paper, plastic, and glass. If community service should not be mandatory, I think that it should be extra credit for my grades if I do it. One way to get more people to do community service is to have parties for the people that participate for a certain amount of time. Last, I think there should be awards for the people that do the most community service.

Some of my friends do community service for our town. Meanwhile, some of my other friends do not do community service, and think that it is a waste of their time. I think that community service is a wonderful thing to do. I think that you should consider making community service mandatory for all students. Community service, helps others in need, teaches students responsibility, and gets them involved in what is happening around them.

First of all, community service helps others in need. By making community service mandatory, you will be helping the lives of many other people or the environment. Little things like picking up trash in the park, or walking a neighbors dog, would really help out the town and the people living in it. Small things can make a big difference. And if everyone has to do community service, our town will be making a big difference in our community.

Next, community service will teach students responsibility. Having to be somewhere to help someone every week or so, will teach them responsibility. Helping someone out will teach students how to be responsible, and how to manage their time wisely. Some people said that it would be a waste of their time to do community service. When it is not a waste, and could also help them out. For example, if a student likes playing at a park, but they do not do their part to help keep it clean, it can be closed. One person makes a big difference.

Lastly, it helps students get involved in what around them. Community service will help students to know what is going on in their town. By helping out a less fortunate family will let a student know that there are people in town that need help. And that there are little things that we can do to help them. Also, if a student is tutoring a child, they will learn that there are kids that may need a little more help then he or she might need. And that tutoring them can help make a very big difference.

In conclusion, I think you should make all students do community service for our town. It will help many others in our town that need help. It will help teach students responsibility. Also, it will get students involved in what is happening around them. Therefore I think that you should make community service mandatory for all students in our school.",5,Community service,Independent

I believe that everyone should be required to do community service.

The people of the school need to realize that if you do the community service it not only helps you but also the people around you.

If you were to do some community service it would be good to put on your college and/or job applications.

Just because you are not being payed to do it, doesn't mean that you can't do it. I believe that if a student decides not to do it they should be punished.

You don't have to do anything be and special, you could just start off by helping people take their groceries to their vehicle.

Maybe after they start off with the little things they will realize how much it really does help the people around them.

Once they start to get the hang of it they might actually help more often rater than only doing it when someone forces you.

Maybe if they start off at a young age they will do it more throughout their life.

You would think that younger people would have more energy to do more things, rather than older people.",2,Community service,Independent
AF3A4FCE2457,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

You have to make a decision on whether or not to make all of the students perform community service let me tell you my point of view. I strongly encourage you to have all the students perform community service for various reasons. The first reason is that some places desperately need help from young willing students. Also, this will help better prepare students for work in the future. Finally, the most important reason is that this will teach students responsibility. Now, ponder my reasoning and read about all of my various ideas about this subject.

First and foremost, community service is a great way for low income and rundown places to get help from young willing students. They are strong and able to help for long periods of time. Some places, like community shelters, desperately need help because they are financially instable and they don't have enough money to hire help. This will give them more help and they will get things done faster. Also, this will save them a lot of money because they wouldn't have to hire anyone new. The work would get done, but at a faster and more affordable rate, not to mention that they will be very grateful.

To add to my reasoning, this experience will better help a multitude of students gain insight into what its like to work. People spend more time working then anything else and this experience will help them prepare for that. They will know what it is like to commit to a job. They will have to work to either get enough volunteer hours or get a good grade. They will have to help the best they can and give one hundred percent of their efforts in order to do well and gain the respect of who they are volunteering for. This is vital for a good relationship and for an overall good grade. This will help them prepare for what its like to work in the real world. They even may find what job they really want to do by volunteering or volunteer where they want to work.

Finally, the most important reason is that this will teach the students responsibility. Now a days students are lazy and just watch television or play video games all the time. This will make them strive for some thing better with their life. It will teach them what it means to work hard and to be dedicated. In this generation, the work ethic is at a minimum and we are just downright lazy. This might make kids want to get up and work if they find a job or volunteering center that really interests them. They will eventually want to get up and go do their community service without being asked or told. They may even make a bond with whom they are volunteering for and they may make a friendship for life.

In summation, volunteering is very beneficial for various reasons. First of all, volunteering helps places that are in need of workers and a helping hand. Also, this experience will help better prepare students when they get jobs in the future. Finally, volunteering will give the students responsibility. These are very excellent points that I know you will carefully consider and ponder, because that is the right thing to do. This is really what volunteering is about, not the material things you do, but how you change while doing them.

Hello. I'm STUDENT_NAME. My home room teacher is TEACHER_NAME. I'm writing because, I feel that Community Service for children or young adults is a good thing to do. I say that because it will keep students out of trouble at school, home, and on the streets. To do Community Service says a lot about one person. There are many reasons why we should do Community Service, but i' m only going to state three purposes.

Keeps The Environment Clean And Healthy

To want a healthy environment should come natural to a lot of people. Why would somebody want their surroundings a ""dump"". When someone does a bad thing, they get in trouble and have to do Community Service. My opinion is it shouldn't take someone to get in trouble to clean their own area. They should willingly want to keep there environment safe and healthy. Clean and Healthy environment will stop killing a lot of habitats for animals. Will also, stop polluting the air we breathe.

Keeps You Out Of Trouble

A big reason is it keeps young adults from doing wrong choices, and keeps them out of a lot of trouble. When your cleaning your occupied with what you are doing. Say you weren't Cleaning and someone ask, ""Do you want to go smoke?"" Sometimes young adults do or say things to impress a friend. Some people do it because of bullying or peer pressure. Peer pressure And bully is a bad habit for a lot of kids now. I don't fully understand what causes people to bully but, I have an idea. When your cleaning you usually don't think about what is happening out on the streets. You think about how good it makes you feel to clean your community.

It's The Right Thing To Want To Do

By doing Community Service will make you look good to other people. Some people think that when you do Community Service it's because you've done something bad. It don't always happen like that. Some times you even get rewarded for a good deed. A good deed is something that people will cherish you, because you helped save our environment by cleaning it up. I would personally free willingly want to clean up our surroundings.

I am an 8th grade student at your school. I have heard that u have decided to ask students at our school to write a letter concerning if u think that we should worry about community service. I think that YES our school needs to do community services. Community service helps our environment. Also if u noticed the main word in community service is community. By doing community services you help your community by doing service, by making it better. Community service can mean a lot of things like picking up litter, helping people, doing work, tutoring people your also suppose to do everything that would in any way help it. Also by our school doing community service we could be well known around our state by taking these peaceful actions. We might even be on the news or newspaper. By doing this action we might get sponsors or people might donate money to because we worked so hard by helping it and taking care of it the community might give back. Also I think if we do this more people will want to come to our school to enroll or interview us. All I am saying to you is that in my opinion we should always help our environment healthy by doing this.

E7296D97815C,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME, I am in eighth grade and a student of SCHOOL_NAME.

I feel that all students should participate in community service. I feel they should participate in community service because it would look very good on their college application. Another reason why I said all students should participate in community service is because if some of us students aren't told to do something like, pick up trash then the trash will still be sitting their until we graduate. Some students will be glad to community service and some students will refuse or as they say ""buck."" I feel that most students that have been doing what suppose to be doing and also has been helping around the school should be rewarded.

Some students think community service is a punishment, but it's not. I know sometimes you think picking up trash is nasty but it's not only helping you, but it's helping the community and your planet. Not all community service is picking up trash sometimes it's recycling or car pooling or even just turning off a light when you leave a room. I also think everyone should do community service because wouldn't it be nice for a change to see all students do work.

Community service to me is a change. We make changes everyday, but when we make those changes think about the world and how you should help it. If it was up to me community service would be the only options, because some students have time to come out and do community service but some chooses to go home and dent the couch, and that's just selfish. TEACHER_NAME you know when you tell us to do what we are suppose to do, it goes threw one ear and out the other. Why waste anymore time making suggestions and start making orders.

The main reason why most students to do community service is because some students go by their own well and whether do illegal stuff than do community service. This situation should be solved now!

These students are suppose to do work such as community service. If they don't do the work why bother even try to get a job. We waste entirely too much time say ,"" Don't do this, or don't that."" Their going to do it anyways.

That's what I STUDENT_NAME think about community service.",3,Community service,Independent
EA3B2BC17E2A,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should require kids to partake in community service. It could help troubled kids out and take away the pressures in life. It could teach kids the meaning of helping others and to not be selfish. Community service can also help those who are in need of food or need a tutor to pass whichever grade they are in.

Community service could help the people who are involved in gangs to stop and help others. This one kid in the ninth grade was in a gang, but stopped because he started community service. If a gang member was trying to find something else to do besides be involved in gang affairs, he could do community service to stop his violent needs.

Community service would help those who need to learn to not be selfish. If someone was self centered and didn't care about anyone but himself/herself, they could perform community service to learn the value of helping others. If everyone would perform community service then not a lot of people would be self centered. A kid named OTHER_NAME was self centered until he got involved in community service.

If people in our school participated in community service, then the graduation rate of Texas graduation rate would go up. Also the number of homeless people could go down. The students that participate help tutor kids and help build houses. It might be a big responsibility, but I am positive we can manage to help people out. A fifth grader named OTHER_NAME

wouldn't have passed the fourth grade if it wasn't foe his tutor, who was performing community service.

As I have stated, community service has only positive effects no negative ones. If you would require the students of SCHOOL_NAME to partake in community service than more people would graduate, there won't be a lot of young gang members and there won't be a lot of selfish people. Please consider requiring students to participate in community service.

This letter is to inform you of the idea of requiring students to perform community service. Community service is a good was to show others how our school wants to help out in our community. This can be fun, educational, a great way to have community service hours for the future, a great way to give people an idea of how SCHOOL_NAME is a great school, and a way to teach and inspire others.

Community service can be fun for everyone. Students can have fun with their friends while doing something for others. It is also a great opportunity for us students to make new friends, or grow closer to our old friends. This would also be a good opportunity for us students, the faculty and the teachers to grow closer as a family. If ICS were to help out at a soup kitchen, it would be fun for all of us to work together and cook, clean, and make others happy.

Community service is educational. While doing community service hours, students can learn how to do things that they didn't know how to do before for example; cleaning up litter at a local playground and at our church. This would give students a chance to learn about the environment and be more aware of the planet.

Community service is a great way to have service hours. Service hours are very helpful in the future. For example high schools, and colleges look at your community service hours and there is a greater percentage that you may get in that school. If they know that you are helpful to others, they would know that you would be helpful in their school.

Finally, community service is an amazing way to give others an idea of how much SCHOOL_NAME is an amazing school. If people see that SCHOOL_NAME students are helpful, and aware of the planet we live in, they would consider putting there child in our school. Not only would it make people consider this, but it would also leave a good reputation on our school and how it is run.

Community service is a great way to teach and inspire others. If somebody sees you in the street cleaning, they may be inspired to do the same. Also, you can teach and tutor younger children and give them more knowledge.

In conclusion, community service is good for the students, the faculty, and the school. It would help us, while helping other. It is fun and even educational. Community service would be a great way to show people how SCHOOL_NAME is a great school, and inspire other schools to do the same.",5,Community service,Independent
7D1925281627,"Dear Principal,

I believe that community service is a good deed and that everyone should be required to at least do some kind of community service.

Also, all students should be require to do at least one kind of community service per school year.

For example, they could hold a day where they go around the community and pick up trash.

They could also do something easier like tutor elementary school students.

It doesn't have to be something hard, as long as they affect the community in a positive way.

If the student doesn't do community service at least one time in the school year, then they wouldn't get their final report card until they complete one community service activity.

So that means that their parents are not going to be able to see their report card until they complete it.

If students don't know what kind of community service to do, our school has a community service club where students help the community in a variety of ways.

It is fun because you can meet new people in this club.

Also, you can get to know your community better.

It also helps you to complete one community service by the end of school year.

It is a fun and easy way to complete this task.

To prove that each student did a community service, they would have to have a parent signature on a form that explains and verifies that they completed it.

But if they join the community service club, they would just need to get the club supervisor's signature.

Also they should be required to turn in a reflection about the community service they did with their form so we know what kind of community service they did.

If they don't turn in that form and the reflection by the end of the school year, then they would have to suffer the consequences.

So that is why I strongly believe why all of our students are required to do community service.

It is a good way to help students become better people.

Students should volunteer for community service because our environment is becoming very trashy and disgusting. I believe that all students living in our community should take the time to pick up trash around our schools, houses, and community playgrounds. We want our neighbors to feel comfortable living in our community. Also when younger kids go to play at our community parks, we want them to be safe and having fun in a clean park. Instead of walking all over potato chip bags, candy wrappers, broken glass bottles, or even doggy business. Or when people are walking their dog they wouldn't want their dogs getting hurt by broken glass on the ground or stepping in another dogs business. So I suggest that students take a little time away from playing video games, using the internet, or watching T.V to come and just pick up a little trash around their neighborhood to keep it cleaner. It will make our community safer, cleaner, and better. It will also attract friendly neighbors to a clean community!",3,Community service,Independent

Principal,

I think that students should be required to perform community service. My friends and I agree that community service is very important. It is a good way to be a part of the local community and show your support for it.

Some students really enjoy service projects around the community. However, other students don't have as much free time as others because they are involved in other activities, such as sports or music. To solve this problem, I think only a small amount of community service should be required. This amount might be around 2 hours per semester or whatever you think best. If the students wish to perform extra community service, there might be a special prize for them (such as a certificate, trophy, or gift) or small academic exemptions since they went above and beyond the standard requirement.

Please strongly consider this suggestion. Please think of community service as a way to make our school more strongly tied in the community and more excellent.

I want you to think about community service and why you want all of the students to participate.

I can see your point of view and how we should all help out and do our share to help the environment.

But what about the students that don't have time to help out.

Like the students that are having trouble at school and they need to focus on their grades so they can get a good education.

Or the kids who's parents are in the hospital and the kids is taking care of the parent and they don't have the time to even worry about themselves.

Personally I can understand why you want everyone to help but you don't need to force us to do this.

Everyone helps out every day even if they don't know it.

Like a girl I know who babysits her neighbors kids every once and a while or even a kid picking up a piece of trash in the school cafeteria.

You might not notice it but we students do a lot of community service.

Actually this Thursday the school is helping out by having a bake sale for a girl who died of cancer and they're raising money for awareness .

Some kids are spending time tonight to bake cupcakes, cookies and other sweets for the bake sale.

While others are staying after school to help sell when they could have been at home on the computer or working on homework.

See we help out on our own when we have time, but if you make all of us participate then we won't be happy and then helping the community will become more like a hassle than something we sacrificed our time for.

I hope you truly understand our point of view and I hope you will give us an option on whether we should help the community, because we all help out in our own little ways.

Yours truly,

I really think it would be right to do community service because it would look really good on our school application for college. Even thought we wouldn't like doing this community service, it would look really good on a college application. This service could be for soup kitchens, catholic charities, and other things that people would need help with. People around the world may think this is stupid but it can make a difference.

This school would be a great place if everyone would do this once a month. When people from different high schools see that we have helped people, they would like us to go to their school. People may say that's a big responsibility but it can help a lot of people. Whether these people are different, it doesn't matter it can make a difference.

This school has helped people like this. We have helped the catholic charities, pennies for peace, and the OTHER_NAME Center. We have raised many of things to these charities. When we were in sixth grade we have helped the OTHER_NAME

Center and we gave them toothbrushes, hair products, and many other things that have helped them/ The were very blessed to have a school like this to donate them these items.

Pennies for peace was to support the people in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We provided pennies for their schools, each penne cost at least one pencil. We have donated $48 dollars to these school that need supplies. That is about four-hundred pencils for these kids!

In seventh grade, we did catholic charities, this is a place where the homeless could get food when they didn't have money to get their own. A few of my friends and I would go to this facility and help these homeless get their food. Two people would bag the groceries, two people would get the different breads if needed, and the other two would get them toiletries bags if needed. We have helped over fifty people! They were also blessed to have kids like us.

As you can see we have helped different people a lot. You can make a difference also by trying to help people, like me, and make a difference. These people were happy to have a great school like us.

Another take that i have is that it is a good thing for people that are trouble makers and have no respect because it shows them that they are more fortunate for what they have and show them how good they really got it also i feel like it would change them as a person and it would change the way they act in front of other people and the way they act as a citizen so i feel that it is up to you weather or not you want to do good for others and even yourself.

I think that students should help by doing community service because if they don't then people including them could get sick from nasty things like trash that should be in the trash cans. Everybody should do this and i don't see that people would not. If you don't, bad things will happen. the people who want to do community service, that's great and it shows appreciation on your part. The people who don't want to do community service, that's bad. Your not only making the environment worse, your letting the nasty trash (Litter) hurt people including you. I think if the people who wont help are not really my friends because if they were real friends they would help the environment. They should be happy for helping, If they do they will save a whole lot than a few people, They will save the whole WORLD. I know some people don't want to go outside and do work, there to busy sitting down on the couch watching tv and going on the computer, eating junk food etc... but this is the world at stake, Just get up, go outside and help save the world.

I believe that students should be required to do community service. The community service could help people to make better choices as a human being. The kids that do nothing all day could use the exercise to get out and do something for the community. I believe our school could use these actions to improve a productive citizen. Some community service actions such as picking up litter, going to the animal shelter to help care for animals that have been neglected, would be ideal for the schools community. It could help students become better people if they know what community service is about. If a student does not like community service, he or she may follow the rules or laws so they will not have to perform these actions.

Have you ever thought of a time when you were not sure if you should help the community or not. To me, that has happened multiple of times. I think that the students should be required to perform in the community because it would help them in many ways. Helping the community learn how to be unselfish, be better people in their lives ahead, and it would benefit everybody in that community.

In the first place, by the students being required to perform in the community they will learn how to be unselfish and to help other people. While the students do this task of helping in the community, they will see how helping and thinking about others would do them much good. Not only that but that would also help them to learn to put other peoples needs in front of their wants. They can want a fancy sports car while another person may NEED food to put on the table and feed their children.

Pursuing this further, it would help them be better people in their lives ahead. By helping people now and planting trees so on so forth, they will learn that by helping other people would make them feel good inside. That would make them feel that helping others is a fantastic thing that they should carrying on through out their whole life.

Lastly, it would benefit every person and every thing in that community. Something as simple as helping a senior citizen cross the street would make a HUGE difference. Planting a tree would give more oxygen to the air and fertilize the soil with its nutrients. doing any little good deed would help the environment and the community around it.

In retrospect, this is what a good deed would look like if the students were to perform in the environment. It would be a good idea because it would teach the students not to be selfish, be better people, and it would benefit the whole community at that. I personally think it's a great idea to have the students be required to perform in the community. How about you? what do you think we should do?",4,Community service,Independent

You know you have heard what kids have been saying right, about if we should be required to do community service or not? Well I have friends that support both sides of the issue, and they are constantly bickering at one another, and is just want that to stop. So before you read this letter think to yourself, should i make kids do community service ? Well after you read this letter, your decision will most likely be yes, i should make kids do community service.

As I stated up top, i think you should make us do community service, even if we don't want to. One reason why you should make us do community service is so that we know kind of what we want to be when we grow up. By doing community service, it opens up opportunities, and different choices that we never knew we had. So say someone has their mind set on being a professional athlete, but then gets the urge to be a firefighter? Then he can do community service to see if that urge to be a firefighter was a legitimate idea.

Doing community service also builds a person's character. I say this because what if someone was mistreated all of there life, wrong place at the wrong time, you know what I mean. So community service lets those type of people get away from their life, and help other people's, thus resulting in building character, and thus further resulting in a changed person for the rest of their life

In conclusion, I am for making kids do community service. I am for this for a few reasons. My first reason for this is to make kids figure out what path they are going to be headed down in life, and maybe even change that path to a better one. Another reason is that community service builds character, and it can also result in the changing of somebody's whole entire life. So after you read this letter, I hope you can see deep down inside your heart that making kids do community service is only a good thing. And I am sick and tired of hearing my friends argue all the time. So if you are going to make a decision, I think almost everyone at are school would hope that you would make a decision sooner rather than later. So i guess also see you at school Mr. Principal.

I am writing to you today to tell you that picking up liter would be a good idea. I think that students should do community service because it is good for the community and the country. I think we can all get together and do that to help out our city. But there will be some people that will probably disagree with me. There will be lazy people that will not do it. Then there are some that will. So we have to come together and make this happen. And get a group of people in our community and pick up trash on the side of the road or just recycle. And that will make this a better community. For example make a group of people that will pick up trash on the side of the road, and a group that will recycle. And a way that will get the lazy people up is compete against each other and see who does a better job. And at the end the group that gets the most trash picked up or recycled gets a surprise. And the next time we do it the lazy people will probably get up and do it. And maybe we can hold like a big carnival or something like that. For them at the end of the contest. And a big mile race to raise money for the community and get better equipment for the job to pick up trash. And we can raise money to build a Community park or a city swimming pool. For the family's of our community. And at the end of the year the team with the most points for the trash pick up and the recycling. will get a surprise for the effort they put. So these are some of my ideas i hope you fell the same way i do.

I think many students want to help planet Earth in many ways. I help the planet by picking up trash or by helping animals, sometimes my friends throw trash on the floor and i tell to pick it up and throw it away. Many kids want to help the planet Earth but sometime they don't show it, they look like they don't want to help but they do. I think helping planet Earth is very helpful but sometimes it cant take time from you like you have to do something else but you can because you have to help the planet. Kids don't know that you can help planet Earth at least 3 times a week you don't have to do it every day. People like adults help the planet every day hey just don't know it. I tell my parents to tell their friends to help the planet Earth and i tell my friends to tell their friends to help the Earth because its very important to help our planet because we want to protect it and keep it safe we want to go GREEN. The word green its very important because it means that we want to recycle and help the Earth, people use that word a lot like they would say ""Go green"" This word helps a lot because it means helping and people like to help. If i were a principal i would do this for my students and for planet Earth and i would try to help to.",2,Community service,Independent

I think it is a good idea for student to have to do community service if they want to. It makes the community nicer and not as messy and dirty. The students would do better in school because they would take pride in their community. Everyone would think the students are great for helping people. If they volunteered to do things the town would be a better place. If the students went to the senior center the people in it would feel better and more relaxed. The students might make friends at the senior center and go back when not in school. If they helped at a animal shelter and fed, watered, and got to know the animals they might adopt one or suggest one to a friend. The elementary students would be smarter and the older students might learn some things. I do not thing they have to do it if they do not want to. It should be for extra credit or a prize raffle. If the student has some thing better to do that is fine. They might have to catch up on homework or spend time with family. They should not have to go if they are allergic to dogs or have to help younger students if they need help themselves.

If some want to have fun that is fine. More people would do it if it was fun to help or if they got to do it with friends. For example, if the kids family is going to on a camping trip they should not have to go. They could be doing community service on their own and not have to do it in school. Their parents could sign a slip so they do not have to if they volunteer with family

Hopefully,

I am on both sides for this argument. I like the idea for helping others and you not get paid but I also am an active kid and I wouldn't have much time to perform the tasks required by you.

I agree with requiring the students to do community service. I agree with this because I like to be that guy that helps others with no cost. I also like that idea because I have done it before and i' m willing to do what is required again. I also feel that this will give all of the lazy kids an opportunity to not be lazy and get up from the couch and make a difference for there community, my community, our community. This also may turn around the lives of the more ""bad"" kids that drink and also do other bad things like drugs and stuff. If you are able to make that much of a difference in our community, then you most probable will get best principal of the year and maybe you'll get transferred to a high school and be the principal there and then you'll probable have a better salary.

I also do agree with the other side of the argument. I agree with the other side because like me many people are very busy with school already. We all have to do homework. Some of us are involved with after school activity's(sports, and clubs). Then there is also kid's like me that not only don't have time on the weekdays for community service but on the weekends I have no time for it. I along with lots of other people disagree with this argument. Also if you go through with this then you might be hated by many of the students because they hate school as it is and now they are required to do community service. I don't think that they will like that idea all that much.

That is the reasoning behind the fact that I agree with both sides here and i am sorry that i probable just made your life a lot harder on making your decision.      ",3,Community service,Independent

I have heard that you are thinking about requiring all students to do community service. Because some kids have been doing it and they like it. But also some kids do not like it they say it takes time away from there day. I believe that you should not require all students to take part in community service because they should not be forced to do it and kids who do pick up there own trash should not have to pick up others.

I think that kids can not be forced into community service by there school principal because the only person that can do it is a judge for punishment. But you cant force it for not doing anything wrong. I think that It is unconstitutional and should go to court if this were to happen. Also some parents may not like this due to after school activities. Or if they did it during the school day the kids aren't learning during school hours.

Also some kids could pick up there own trash and they don't want to pick up someone else's trash. And if they made it a team thing or a group thing then that's a socialist way of doing it and trust me no one will help a slacker in a group. That's how a steal case building is going out of business hear because they went from doing work on your own to a team working environment.

Now you may say that we aren't punishing them and that it teaches them to keep the environment clean. But in reality the kids are going to feel that they are being punished. And trust me they are not going to have fun. And come home saying they were so lucky to pick up old rotten trash of the road.

in conclusion I believe that you can not force kids to do community service if they do not want to. Unless they were being punished for a instance ware littering was involved. So please do not make them do it, its against the constitution and the bill of rights.",3,Community service,Independent

I think it is a really good thing to do community service. We all need to know how much we will be working when we get older. I also think that we need to know how much time we are needed when we get older and get a job. Like lets say I work at church and babysit little kids, I think we could use how to babysit and stuff. We all need to learn how to work in the city, and also like how we should behave in a real job. And when we go do stuff like at school, then we could be helping out with what they need us to help them with. But my opinion is think there should be less hours and credits than what we have to do. But every once in a while I think we should really know how to do all the community hours. The people who think they don` t have time to do the community service, they won` t be as successful in life than the ones doing the community service.

DACB465971AA,"Why should we do community service? We should do community service because to help our Country with the litter and to make it clean. We should help old people cross the road.

Picking up litter is good for our environment and helping people carry there stuff. If people dropped there stuff I would help them pick it up and take to there car, and there homes. If you look at the desert you see a lot of bottles and plastic bags and you want to make it clean so other people can know that we are a clean city. I would think that and I would go pick up as much as I can.

If i saw people struggle with there things I would help them take it were ever they need to take it. If that was you wouldn't you want some help you.

I have been hearing about all this commotion with this community service stuff. I feel like i should have my say in this part so i' m going to tell you what i think about the community service. I think we should have students take part in community service.

The first reason i think we should participate in community service is that it sets a good example for people. By doing this i feel like we could persuade other schools to take part in this experience. And possibly make this a worldwide thing to do in this country. That's my first reason why i think we should take part in community service.

Responsibility. That is what this would teach us students. It would help them understand the work world. Also how to care for others or helping around the town with certain things. That is what this community service thing would do for us.

My last reason i think we should do this is this would be an on going thing in the school. It would keep going on 20 years later 30 years 50 years 100 hundred years. It would be an on going thing which would be setting examples and helping out around the town for years to come. I would teach our kids to do this and our kids kids to do the right thing and participate in this community service project. That is my last reason for this.

I hope i have persuaded you enough to take action in this. Cause responsibility is a big part of peoples lives and i think this would be just the right thing to do for us children. So i support taking part in community service.

I think students should have the choice to do community service, or send a letter home to parents asking if it would be ok for there kid to do community service. On the letter you can list options of community service and have the parents decide weather they would want there chilled to do community service, but leave the options of ""no i do not want my chilled to do community service."" The kids that volunteer to do community service should be rewarded for what they are doing for the community. Like if a kid is forced to do community service that is un-fair for them. If a kid says no i do not want to participate in community service then they don't have to do that it is there choice or there parents choice.

It would not be fair if the principle told everyone that they had to do community service for school. Or if they said no and got in trouble for something that they don't want to do, or there parents doesn't want them to do for reasons un-known.",2,Community service,Independent

We've been told you are thinking about making community service for students a requirement. I respectively disagree. I think that we should make our own choices on how we want to spend our time and community service doesn't really relate to academics. Also, requiring it isn't the only tactic. Read on to see the reason for my opinions.

To begin, we have the right to make our own choices on what we would like to do after school.

Its not right, in my opinion, to force us to do something we don't want to. Granted, community service a noble way to spend your time but some kids aren't partial to it. I invite you to put yourself in our shoes and consider our feelings toward being forced to participate in community service.

Secondly, community service doesn't have to relate to academics. I can't see the purpose in requiring this when it won't assist in our learning or education. I hope you understand that what we do after school hours is our time. We can choose to spend it any way we want. School and community service are two different subjects.

My final reason is that making community service mandatory isn't the only way to influence our after school activities. You could imply the idea and give us some positive things about it. You could send letters home about other ways to spend our free time with community service. I'm sure there are other tactics to make us perform community service.

In conclusion, Thank you for considering my opinions. I hope you think about it when you are deciding your decision. We have the right to make our own choices, it doesn't relate to acedemics, and its not the only tactis",3,Community service,Independent

I think we should all be required to do at least 3 hours of community service. It would be a great way for everyone to get involved in their community and help others. It looks good if you have community service on your college application. This can help you with your life goals and make you a better person.

We can tell the students about this in a way that makes it sound exciting like giving examples which makes it easier. We could say,' you can clean up trash in your neighborhood with your friends'. This might make it sound more exciting if you say you can do it with a friend. They can also help out at a daycare or assisted living center with their friends too.

Some of the kids say that they don't have time to do community service but they can make time. We can explain to them how they can complete their homework, do sports and other things and still do community service. We can give them tips on how to manage time and be responsible.

I think that helping in community service is a great idea. I think that you should ask the students first if they would like to participate in community service and the ones that do could sign up for it. You could explain to them how it can help you in the future. . Tell them the different ways with helping your community, they can clean up a park, recycle things, donate different kind of stuff, helping out at a nursing home and many other ways.

Some may not want to because they might think it takes to much time. But if they decide to help ,they can do it! Explain how It will help you become a better person, you will get to help others and that will make you feel good about yourself.

It has come to my attention that you want to require all students to perform community service. Would you like it if you had to do forced labor you did not want to do at all. I'm guessing you wouldn't enjoy that. We wouldn't either .

All though, its a respecting idea I believe we should have our own opinion in a mater like this.

Even though, helping the community is the good thing to do but some of us have so time on our hand and its hard enough to keep up with our chores and school work at the same time you want us to commit other tasks. Some of us have trouble in school and might take extra classes and we do need to focus on our future. its hard enough balancing so much.

Moreover, our parents to make us do chores around the house cleaning and or babysitting a younger sibling. That's a lot to juggle we can't keep up with many things. some students might be in a sport and cant be focusing on community service. The way us kids see it is community service is like a punishment to us children and as I see it we did nothing wrong to deserve it. We should have the choose to want to or not do community service.

In addition, this might cause our minds to stress out we have so much to keep on track with. We also love to spend time with our friends and family and community service will take up time that we want to use. It affects us in everyway some of our parent wouldn't like the idea and wouldn't stand for it. Because we need to help around the house and our parents and other family members.

So do the right chose because community service isn't a thing we want to or have time to do. We can only do so much were still children's and do perform many tasks in such little time. And it's agreed that school and family do come first the education is what matters as my mother always told me.

I think you should make it mandatory for your students to perform community service. It would benefit the community with your students helping out and may change several students. Most students don't do anything important after school or on there free time so it would give them something to do and it would be helpful to everyone. Just think about it which one do you think would be better for a student to do, tutor children or sit and watch television all day. Community service would only take a few hours giving them enough time to complete their home work and giving them time to do whatever hobby they enjoy. It would be better for them to help the community because it would make the community a better place. With people helping out especially with students, most likely they will learn something from their experience helping out the community. Since their are a lot of students their would be a lot of people helping out. It would help out and give the students something to do, consider adding community service to your school.",2,Community service,Independent

I understand that some students do not like or want to do community service for reasons their own. I think that making it a requirement to do community service is a very bad idea.

We should not make community service a requirement on the students because it will have most wanting to go to another school because they can do community service on their own time, students will purposely miss school so they can have the option for community service, you will most likely get a lot of complaint letters from parents and that can be very dangerous.

My first reason for this not being a good idea is students can do community on their own time because community service is volunteer work not demanded work from people. If some people do it and some people don't oh well, they don't have to do it if they want to . most students like me don't have very much free time because of school and family work and business issues.

Secondly, students will miss school for other things like friends and home.

and most of all students don't like getting told what to do because this is our life and we want to live it with people and they can choose community service they choose. If at school there is a threat parents will make sure the student doesn't come to school.

Last but not least, you will receive mail of some sort from parents and they will be very colorful at least most of them will be. If they were from my mom they defiantly will be like that and a few more things will be said that will be very mean.

I think the students should do the community service. It will show that they actually care about their community. It will also show how much responsibility they have and how mature they are. The parents will be very grateful on what their kids are doing for the community. For example if they clean up all the trash around them, imagine how beautiful the community will look. Picking up all the litter is very important because some animals will mistake it for food and then they'll get sick and we don't want our wonderful animals dying because of how lazy some people are. We want to help the animals with a clean, healthy environment. This makes the kids look like they actually care about something important like this. Another example would be helping out the seniors at the senior center. I think the older people would love to have someone to talk to and spend a whole day with. The kids will take them for walks around the park, take them to lunch, and have just a wonderful day. Doing all this will make your students look really good and how much of a role model they can be to kids younger than them. I hope you really think about what your students could do for the entire community and how much of good help it would be. This would also look good on the students application for college. I'm sure in the end if you have them do community service people would love to have the extra help to make the community be a wonderful beautiful place.

Lately, there has been some discussion around the school on whether or not students should be required to perform community service.

In my opinion, it should not be required.

Community service, while it does help the community, takes lot of time.

In our school's society, homework is extremely important.

Students are required to take time and put all of their effort into completing homework thoroughly and correctly.

When students do this, they maintain the maximum understanding of the material.

If students were required to perform community service, homework quality might decrease.

After-school activities are also a necessity for a student.

They help students get extra energy out, while keeping them in shape and healthy.

Community service might build character, but in my case, and many others, after-school sports and activities help my focus during the school day.

If students think of community service as a requirement, they might not get the same benefits.

Even though I think that community service should not be a requirement, I do think it should be promoted throughout the school community.

If community service is an important part of someone's everyday life, then they can set up clubs or get a group of people to perform community service with them.

For example, someone could set a club focused on learning about and volunteering at animal shelters.

These clubs can get the rest of the school involved by setting up a fundraiser for the whole school to donate to.

Community service can also get included in the school's curriculum.

For instance, students could research a local charity and present their findings to the class.

I hope you understand my position and consider my ideas.

I am sure that community service can be recognised in the school community without taking away from students' education.

I believe that community service is very important, and is a major part of our town. I think it is a great way to teach teens and young adults learn what it means to help out and make them feel better about doing something for their communities. Many teens these days loaf around home texting and wasting their time checking on who likes their status on Facebook. It would be a good way to get them to help out and make a difference.

I think that doing something good and having a positive feeling about it is an addiction. For me, helping and elder cross the street or teaching a child how to do math would make me feel better than sitting around and virtually communicating with friends. Community service is a great way to get people of all ages to help out around town and learn what it means to live in a place where help is always needed. An old friend of mine, who had a disease where, over time, would deteriorate the strength of muscles all over the body, gave me an example of how hard it was, even as an eighth-grader, to stand up or even to walk. Think of all the ways middle schoolers could help people with diseases or illnesses.

Once, my youth group at church went to a nursing home and sang to the elderly people. It made my day afterwards because I knew that when I get older, I would appreciate something like that. Like I said, doing something good is an addiction, and it makes you want to feel it again. From that day forward, I have enjoyed and even sought-out the chance to do something good. If the whole school of young and capable teens could feel that, and get the want to feel it again, I think that our town would benefit from it.

I agree totally of your choice to make it necessary for teens to do community service, and I hope that I can do something to help out as well.

I hope that in the future our community will be a better place and will invite people from all over the nation to see how just a few people can make a big difference.

Students like i think kids should be required to do community service. As a student i feel that this could give back to the community. By all means school should cost money but i am thankful that it doesn't. An the community works hard for the students here. They do things like help donate to the school an sell our spirit wear in their stores.

This also will help the students learn how to do good deeds, because when you do good deeds it makes you feel good knowing that you helped someone. Taking initiative helps not you or someone else, it does something for everyone. Principal, these students are here to learn an when you learn something it will stay with you for the rest of your life.

I think that giving every kid in the school community service would be good for the school because it will help the community out and help others. I will give out three examples to prove it would be a good thing to give kids in school community service. First example, most kids always say they have nothing to do after school, so make a program with a lot of kids that have nothing to do after school because it will give them something to do.

Second example, most kids also like doing things that will help their community because it helps other and more people will want to do the same. Third example, make community service ex. credit for all the kids that want to join the program of community service because it would help every kid out and then in the next year, a lot of other school will want to do the same thing. I think community service should be required to all student in all schools because it would help them out if the principal would make it ex. credit and then again it would help out the community to look better. That's why I think community service would be great for kids in all schools. Maybe their parents would help the thing go on as well and others would come and join the community service for the community. It would make the principal and other teachers better and learn things from students. Thank you for reading my letter about community service (if kids should or shouldn't have to do it for school.)

I think that the students at our school should be required to do community service.

It is a very positive way to get us to engage in our community.

It's a great way to help our society, it makes others happy, and it sets a good example for others.

Firstly, it's a great way to help our society.

One way to help is cleaning up the side of the road.

By doing this, the walkways are clearer and it looks better.

It might be a big task for one or two people, but if everyone helps out, it will be done in no time.

It only takes a little bit of help to make our community a better place to live.

Secondly, doing community service makes others happy.

For example, we could tutor elementary school children.

It won't be hard for us since we already know the stuff they are learning.

It also makes them happy because it makes them feel smart, so they won't get stressed out and have a tantrum.

They will receive better grades which will make their parents proud of them.

You could also help run a daycare for little kids.

It would make the person running it very happy since he/she won't have to do it by themselves.

Lastly, it sets a good example for others.

If we do community service which makes our community happier and cleaner, others who think it's stupid will want to help.

If everyone is doing it, surely others will want to join so they won't feel left out.

If we want to set a good example for our peers, we should start as soon as possible.

In conclusion, making community service a requirement, will help our society, make others happy, and set a great example for others.

With all this put together, we could live in a better and happier place for everyone.

It only takes a few to start something big, so why not start now?

I am writing you this letter regarding your decision on making it mandatory for students to perform community service. I myself think that it is sort of a waste of time, depends on what you are going to be doing. If it is something fun then I'll agree on making it mandatory if i have the time, if not then it is a waste of time.

Maybe other students don't think it is but i do because i have many things to do when I get home from school or when i am on break.

If u were to make it mandatory then maybe students might agree if you were too make then do a couple of hours. I don't think that would really bother then that much, but lets say you were to over exaggerate and make then do tons of community service than i would know there reason to be furious. Well bottom of the line is that students should be required to do community service, but to cut them some slack u should mandate them to a whole lot of community service so they wont end up furious. Anyways i hope this letter will aid you with the decision on what you should do. Farwell!

I am a student here at our school who thinks that all students should not be required to do community service. I believe people should be the ones deciding if they want to help out in the community or not. Some people enjoy helping out and might want to take a part of community service. Others might have other activities to attend to like sports or church groups. Many might be busy working or having to do homework.

People shouldn't be forced to do something they don't have time to do. I think we have to take care of our priorities first then if time lets us, help out. There is many people out there to glad to help out others, but that might be people who have time to help, or enjoy doing it. Helping out others is important but so its helping out your self first. It would be nice to help out our community and have it clean, but things take time sooner or later little by little I am sure we will help our community. Even if not all of us have the time to help out with community service all at once I am sure there is few other people out there who will be glad to help out our community.

Hopefully this will help you understand why not all of us should have it mandatory to have to do community service. I am sure everyone would be glad to participate but priorities come first and not all of our students have that much time in there hands to be able to complete all there tasks they're made to do.

I wish to address you on how you are considering making community service a requirement for students. First off I'd like to express my feelings on community service then I would like to go on to talk about whether making it required would be a good idea or not.

Community service is a great opportunity to help others. It not only helps and brings happiness to others but in ways you'll find that doing community service can help you too. Many people do it so willingly because of the good feelings they get from knowing that they're making a difference and benefiting someone else without them having someone to pay them to do it. It also helps people greater understand charity and service to others of which the feelings you get from doing these things come no other way. In the end most people feel accomplished and they are sometimes helped just as much as the people they were helping. They volunteer most of the time not for money but for reasons like what i just talked about.

Though great experiences and feelings can come from doing community service bad ones can too. When forced to do something a persons natural reaction is to strike out against or oppose it. The students might start to feel this way such as convicts who are assigned community service by the state do. If this happens the service will be done poorly with little effort and the feelings that are supposed to come from it will be pushed away. In this way of service and in your plan to force the students into it they might skip it even and more importantly they wont learn any lessons or feel any emotions but annoyance. So if you can't force them to do it then how can you get them to do community service?

Encouragement is the answer. By helping and asking politely and advertising community service there will be a far better chance that students will do it, but more importantly they will want to do it. Get the students excited about it and they'll do it and be able to freely experience the great blessings community service has to offer for both sides. Yes you will have a lot less people that end up doing it, but the people that do will be excited, motivated and ready to make a difference in the world one community at a time.

I know principal you're deciding whether to force students or require them to do community service. If I were you dear principal I would require every student to at least do 30 to 60 minutes of community service. I know that's not a lot but we can take to much time of students due to that some students need time to do class work(homework)and prepare for the next day and time for resting. But it does not mean they cant help the community for just a bit.

This idea can help our community improve by the following: If we collect trash and put in the right place we can save plants, animals in danger, and bugs. Also it makes our community look awesome. Also our community wont look bad meaning it make us look like we cant take care of our community.

Also touring may not look a community service but it is students can touter kids in need. This may help us and other kids in need. Another community service can be recycling. That way we can reuse reusable items and not waste them.

I hope I've convince you dear principal and with you're approval of this act even if a short time service it may help our neighborhood.

Students should not be required to do community service because it's unfair for the students who don't want to clean or pick up trash. If students want to volunteer you should let them join in on the action of cleaning up this school. We shouldn't even have volunteer workers picking up trash off of the school grounds because us students shouldn't litter. Every time a student litters they just make themselves look bad and the school, city, or neighborhood also looks horrible. Even though I don't want students to clean up another persons mess we should stop littering all together.

First of all we could give a message to every one of the non caring students at school but they just won't listen to an announcement said by a teacher. That is why we must take action into our own hands to give the students at this school of learning an understanding of why we should stop littering.

I'm writing this letter to inform you on my thoughts and positions on requiring students to perform community service. I would first like start by saying that community service is a great thing. without a good community and those who help we have no community. I agree that students should be required to perform community service. Community service teaches the youth of the importance of having a strong community. It also teaches how to take care of our community when we grow up. Another strong point is to give back. As kids we get everything we want without giving back. Lets show the adults how well rounded are communities youth is. By doing things as simple as community car pooling or just picking up garbage we decrease our pollution in the air which would make this a safer place to live. students such as myself should be assumed to help the community out, also we shouldn't be rewarded with material things for helping our community. Reading to kindergartner's should warm anybodies heart. Knowing that we made some sort of a difference in our community is reward enough. Principal I think I've made my point clear. Are youth should have to perform community service. It wouldn't take away all our free time and it would help our community in so many ways.

I am writing to you to discuss the matter of whether students should or shouldn't do service in the community for school purposes. From what I have observed over the last couple days is that doing service in the community is a great way to build happiness, generosity, and love. Personally, I think everyone deserves to be happy in our community. By doing service our school will be helping out people who need it. We will be spreading happiness throughout our community. It's like a chain re-action, if one person gives happiness to someone then that person will spread happiness to another person and it just keeps going on until everyone is happy.

Students should have to do at least 3 units of service each quarter. A unit of service is where the student decides how much of there time they want to give up to someone who needs it? However much time you give will help. Every inch of service always counts. Like if we delivered food from the OTHER_NAME house to people who don't have enough money to buy food, those people would be so unbelievably grateful! These are only some of the reasons that our school should do service for the community. Thank you for your time.

All students should require to help out with the animals and the people from starvation. It doesn't take time off of you want to do It would help out to make our place a whole lot better than a mess. Its important to help out our community to live in a better place to live. The people who need food you can donate to the people who are starving out there right now. Also You can donate to you're charity to help out the homeless that are starving to eat and donate for the winter of the cold because they might be cold and with no food they can start dying.

I think that you should not make community service a requirement. You already made school a requirement, so you shouldn't make community service a requirement also.

And you can't make us do community service. Yes we should do community service on our own already, but if someone doesn't want to, they shouldn't be forced to.

If you do decide to do something involving community service you should make it an after school activity that kids can volunteer to do. So it would be like the: cooking class, guitar class, or something like they already have but it would be to help the environment instead of cooking or playing the guitar. I bet that if you did make an environment friendly class there would be kids who would want to join and then more and more kids would follow and be encouraged to join the after school activity and become better to the environment.

I do think that if you do make and environment friendly after school activity that we could probably raise money that could go to the school to help on supplies and stuff like that. If we couldn't do that then you shouldn't make environmental friendly anything not a requirement either because of the reasons listed above.

Thank You for taking the time to read this letter. And hopefully you take it to consideration. I also think that if you do not take it to consideration you could also just help to encourage kids to do it on there own and that it's not a waste of time and would be very helpful to the environment and everyone in it.

I have begun to notice some of my friends are beginning to do community service. I've also know that you are thinking that its not such a bad idea for every student to perform some sort of community help. I do agree and disagree with this but there may be some issues to having every student some community work .

I personally believe that no student should be forced to have to do community service but can if they please. I say this knowing that some kids have other activities that take place through out their days which may intervene with there community service jobs. For athletes or people that have something after school or before school daily and has no spare time to work in the community. I also think that its unfair to make someone do something they don't feel they should have to do because if they wanted to do it they would have signed up for on their own rather then to be told they must do it.

I also think that its a good idea because it gives us a chance to help our community. It also gives us a chance to get away from the usual and try to make a change throughout our neighborhoods or anything in our environment. Also we will be doing our parts by getting an education and helping others for our community. I also think it would make us look like a better as a community, school, and district because we are helping out everyone and working together.

This decision is for you to decide whether or not we as students will have to or wont have to do community service. We as a community need to do our parts and so do you and if that's what it takes then we need to work together. I know that some may agree and others may not but I believe both ways and so do others.

I know you are deciding on whether to make community service a requirement.

I would like to suggest some ideas that can make this decision easier for you.

Personally, I think it is great that some people like helping others, but some just don't have the time. For example, a lot of minors do sports and other activities that take up a lot of their time to do anything else.

During the week they have practice and on the weekends they have meets or games.

The rest of the time in the week not spend playing sports or doing activities is spend doing homework, or resting up for what the next day will bring.

If some kids want to do community service they can, but i don't think that you should make it a requirement.

I do gymnastics so I have practice everyday and on the weekends I have meets; the leftover time in the week i use to do homework or hang out with friends.

I wouldn't want to spend my precious homework time to do community service.

A lot of my friends also do soccer and volleyball, and the same as me, they have practice everyday, as well as games on the weekends.

The only time we all have to do homework is after practice and on the weekends after our games.

The community service time would take up my time to be an A student.

As we all know, education is very important.

Plus, we are doing community service by getting an education because, if we do well in school, then we can have good grades and get into a really good college.

After that we can go onto getting good jobs and making our world a better place.

I hope you take my thoughts into consideration that some of us just don't have as much time as other people in the school.

I hope you understand my argument and agree with where I am coming from.

Dear Principal,

So, I hear you are thinking of making all children perform community service. I suppose in a perfect world we wouldn't need community service. No children to tutor, no litter to clean up. However, our world is not perfect, and it seems that community service is in fact necessary. I believe that, for the sake of the community, children should be required to perform community service. Allow me to present my argument.

Let me begin by saying that I do not disagree with those who dislike community service. I dislike it as well. It is a waste of time, and if I had it my way I would not require children to perform community service. However, do you not agree that at least some work is required, at least on the community's behalf? Children do need tutoring, and there is always litter to be cleaned up. We need community service just as much as we need the community. So while I do suggest that you implement mandatory community service, let me request one thing. Do not simply ask children to go out of their way to perform community service, for they will not do it out of the goodness of their hearts. You must either force them to do it, or give them some incentive. Personally, I'd prefer the latter.

In the real world, where I come from, we are actually forced to do community service (Can you believe it?) or else we cannot graduate high school. But in this imaginary world where you live, it looks like you're in charge. I believe you should give children a reason to do community service, like a reward for every few hours of work they do. If this were to happen, a lot more service would get done. Who knows, maybe that perfect world isn't so far away after all.

In conclusion, community service should be mandatory, for the community's sake, but if it were possible to reward children for service they do themselves, that would certainly be a preferable method. I believe that if that were to happen, much more service would get done, and the community would be a smarter, cleaner, happier, better place.

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I have been thinking about what your trying to do about students being required to do community service. In my opinion I say that yes students should be required to do community service because doing good for our planet is good for us and it could be fun. Community service is not only about picking up trash is also about helping ourselves if there was no community services then by know we will be living in a pile of trash, but we are lucky of having it and we need more people to join.

Another reason why students should do community service is because it could also help us with our personality and our life. This could change someone's life because what about if a student does drugs and is a bully and then is required to join community service and ends up liking it. This student changes to a person that is know very caring and gave up drugs because he feels good about himself. I think im going to join community service.

There is no 'community service'

without 'community.' Think about that. Sure there's more to the community than just our school, but doesn't every little bit count?

There really are more important things to do than just sit around watching TV all day. What about all those children? Not the ones with all the new clothes, or the ones with the huge allowance. I mean the ones with nothing. The ones in which the only meal they eat is at school because a classmate offers them a little something. Those are the ones that need OUR help. They're not just in Haiti or Africa. They're right here in this very town, some even in this school.

Community service is simple. It can just be organizing a canned food drive and having each kid bring a little something in. We don't need to go all out. They say a little goes a long way. We all put in a little bit and before you know, we'll have enough to feed a nation. Or maybe just the kids in our town, but still, you get my point.

Community service should be necessary. There's nothing wrong with it.

You give a little time, get a little joy. It's a win win situation for everyone. Let's go out there and do something.

Lending a hand is all it takes. Just help the other students to understand that. We don't have to go and build a whole school in Africa, we just need to do SOMETHING. That something could simply be picking up litter or maybe helping a neighbor with some yard work. We just need to get involved.

All I ask that you think this over with an open mind. Sure kids have homework that they say they need to get done, but they don't do it either way. Let's get them off their couches and into the community. Maybe a field trip to see first hand what goes on? That could give the kids a wake up call. Just put yourself in the shoes of the needy. How would you feel? Alone? Helpless? Maybe like no one cares? Well I know I care. Let's get everyone else on our page.

I think that it should be a requirement to perform community service because it's important to help around your community as much as possible. If everyone contributes, the community will be a much better place to live in. If you do choose to make it a requirement, you should let the student choose what type of community service they can do. Some examples of community service are community clean-ups (picking up trash), painting over graffiti, planting trees and flowers etc. and volunteering at local shelters. I feel that if you are going to make community service a requirement, then at least let the students choose what they will be doing. Another reason that this should be a requirement is that, doing community service will make it easier to get into college. It won't promise an automatic acceptance to a university but it could be very good on your application. If you will make it a requirement, this will be a good thing to share with the students because it will sound appealing to them. Some students may feel that they don't have time but, if they ""don't have time"" for their community, they will end up with a not-so-good community filled with trash, graffiti, homeless animals and dead trees. I think that this should be worth a grade. I also think that there should be a consequence but not a severe one. After all, this would be a requirement not an option. It should be treated like any other subject's assignment.

A clean, safe community is more important than some of us realize, but if you make this a requirement than perhaps it will show people how important it is to keep the community clean and tight-knit.

Wouldn't you like to keep the community at its beauty? Community service is really good for the community and our self-being, but not all of us have the time and will to help out. That's why i don't think that community service is required for all students. I will tell you why I think this is so, and i urge you to keep reading.

There are many things you can do for community service. like cleaning up your city, park, beach, or any public place that you live near. You wouldn't want your home to be messy and unmanageable, right? So why shouldn't you keep your surroundings magnificent, helping keep your city beautiful is something everyone should want to do. Helping out children in need academically is another form of community service. Children should be well educated for a better future, and maybe help your community when he or she possibly becomes successful in their later years.

But sometimes people don't have the time to help out. That person could live a really busy life. your job or getting done what need to be done should be something more important than helping other people. Or maybe they're the ones who need the help with their academics. Sometimes people just want to relax and take it easy for a while.

community service is a good thing for yourself and the community, but you should take other people's needs into consideration. That's why its shouldn't be required for students to perform community service.

I deeply support the fact that community service does the world a lot of good. I do some service on Saturday mornings. I go to the nursing home with a few friends and try to cheer up the tenants. Studies show that people who do community service are less likely to do something infatuated further down the road.

But with every great thought there is something about it which makes it not so great. This invention is no exception. Some people are just to busy to devote their time to community service because they could be taking care of their children, or doing sport activities, they could be doing college work or even homework. Middle school and high school students do not have a lot of time to waste they need to start planning for college, school years is a time to experiment with new activities. It is a wonderful thing to do (community service) but not everyone has the time. Adolescence is such a hard time for children anyway we shouldn't give them to much responsibility because we will just get disappointed .

There is different things we can do though. Instead of ""making"" people do community service. We could have a chart over a year and the child has to do so many hours of service can get credits for graduation. But not so much that they could fail all classes and still be able to graduate because they did so much community service.

If you are really going to take this seriously I would highly suggest asking the children if they would like to do this. If a lot of people are interested maybe make a sign-up sheet for them. Since so many kids are busy you shouldn't make them doing something likes this unless they are volunteering there spared time.

I would love to be apart of this group. Maybe a leader or whatever is okay with you, I would very much enjoy helping you out in any means necessary. Community service is such an amazing thing. It really shows how much America has grown. Times has changed a lot. Fifty years ago kids didn't go to school because they had to help their parents out on the farm. Now we have computers, video games, cell phones. All these things that distract us from what is really important, helping people. We should try this for a year and see if it could possibly catch on then start circulating our ideas throughout the States. This was such an amazing idea I would love to be apart of.

Please write back. I will be waiting for your response patiently. We could do amazing things with your ideas. I was so happy you agreed to a play date with our children.

Do you think our community needs change? I do i thank there is many ways to change our community but one of the easiest ways to do this would be to get kids to get active in cleaning up their community. I think kids should be required to help the community in which they live! It would also give them reason to be proud. I thank it could be very rewarding, everyone would benefit if the community got cleaner.

Also it would make a positive impact on the on other communities, if they see that our community is getting clean they might follow in our community's footsteps!

If kids got active in their own community would be nice because they would be proud of themselves and be proud of their accomplishments.

They would be somebody others are proud of! I think having that sense of pride would help them in life now and in the future. They could also learn many things from doing this one of them things being aware that littering is not good for the community. This is only one of the hundreds of things they could learn.

It would also reward them because living in this community would be nicer and easier.

They may also receive other rewards for doing this. Community service in the present would look good later because it would help to be able to put that on a job or college application.

It would also help populate the community because anyone would choose a clean happy community over somewhere dirty and chaotic. So this would help a lot, in my opinion.

Another pro to having community service would be that other community's would follow in our footsteps!

If we could get a communities around us aware of the benefits they might do the same thing and then our region would be cleaner.

And we would all benefit if others followed us because we would then easily be recognized as nice place to be. That would also help them as well. And they might help other communit",3,Community service,Independent

I think you should have a requirement that all students should have to do a certain amount of community service that they need in order to pass the grade. Even if its just painting a bench or helping around the school. I think students should care more about the community and not just about themselves. Maybe if it just for about fifteen minutes once a week, go to a soup kitchen and help out or go to the beach and pick up litter after school. Even if they see litter on the ground just pick it up to be nice to the environment and the community.

I feel that students don't care about the environment, but they would if they knew the future was in there hands, they would help out more. If they did help out then the world may not end so soon or when they are adults they may not regret helping the community because the community would be in better shape. Everywhere they look, there will be no litter, because they did a good job helping the community and they would teach there kids to help out to around the community. If they didn't help then the world may end sooner or they may regret it when they grow up. Also soon they will not be able to swim in the ocean because there will be to mush pollution in the water. I know that i wouldn't like that, so that means a lot of other people wouldn't like it either. Also there kids wouldn't help the environment so the world would get even more polluted.

Also if they help out around the school then maybe if there kids go here then they may have a better education because they don't need to worry about the community or the environment.

This is why i think you should have every student do a least 90 minutes of community service. For the world ends up better. You should make it for they don't pass the grade or something if they don't do the service.

I strongly feel that if you are in a good community that you've been in for a while, you should at least take your time and pay the community back somehow. For example, letting the children do recycling for their classrooms, or just staying after school for an hour and helping out with a sports team.

Students will at least take a day out of the week to participate.

If some of the students contemplate about doing their responsibility to the community, let them choose a day out of the week to go and volunteer.

For the other students that don't play any sports or do any other activities, they would have the advantage of volunteering more at the school.

In return to their participation, they could receive at least five extra points added to their lowest test grade of a class which they choose.

No candy or toys will be given, because we would want the children to learn that you can make a difference without getting in return.

With the five extra points, the students will volunteer, more because they wanted to. And the fact the cannot play with the five points, such as, the toys or candy.

I honestly think by doing community service, it will prepare the students for more and harder things ahead of time, or it might just even give them a good feeling inside themselves.

I know when I do my community service, I feel proud out myself for making the world a better place one step at a time. Whether it's doing recycling, or helping a younger child with studying. Each thing has its own benefit and purpose.",3,Community service,Independent

I think that not all students should have to do community service. Not everybody has the time to do community service. some people have homework to do and others have families that they have to help or deal with like there brothers and sisters. Not everyone has the time some people have the time but not everyone. I don't think that students should be required to do community service not only that but some people have more important things to worry about than community service. I'm not saying that its a bad idea or any thing like that. Just that some people don't have the time to do community service. Other people may have the time but I know that not every student has the time to do community service.

Dear principal,

I think it would be a great idea for the students at our school to be required to do some community service. It would be a chance for the students to help out in the community, and it would also help the community as well. It is also a way in which students can spend their time wisely.

First of all, the students would be doing a nice thing by helping out in the community. They can help keep the community clean, visit the elderly, or even help out people in their jobs. By this, the people in the community can get some help and the students can learn about people in their community, and their jobs. The students can also get some experience in their field of what they want to be when they grow up. Also, community service is needed to get into college, and the community service can also help a student get into college.

Secondly, it would be a good way for students to spend their time, and students can also learn to manage their time. Instead of staying at home, they can do something which can help other people, and they would also be getting something in return. Students can also learn how to manage their time with their daily schedules, and be able to complete tasks faster, and with good quality.

In my opinion, I think requiring the students at our school to perform community service is a really nice idea. It is a way for them to do something for the community, and it is really good for the students too.

I do not think that you should make it mandatory for students to perform community service.

Community service is great and all but some people just do not have the time to do it.

Some people need the time they spend on community service to do important things like homework or sports.

Some people need time for themselves every once in a while. I do not think you should have kids do community service.

I know from personal experience that community service takes to much time.

I have a baseball practice every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

I also have basketball practice every Tuesday and Thursday.

On the weekends I have games for both sports.

Not only that my brother has the same schedule so when and who could take me to community service.

I think it is bad idea.

Say that you barely have time for community service.

When would you have time for yourself.

I like to enjoy the little free time that I get.

Right now with all my sports and school I barely get a hour to myself each day.

If you add community service instead of that hour then I will have no free time.

Everyone needs a little free time for themselves.

I am strongly against community service.

Community service is good but it just takes to much time.

I know that not everyone at our school can do community service.

Most of my friends do sports like me and do not have the time.

I do not think you should make it mandatory for students at this school to perform community service.

I believe you should make everyone in the school do Community Service because it shows people how to work as a team. Also it helps the world and our community become a better place to live. People wouldn't wan' t to live in a community where it is trash everywhere they go. We should also have a school clean up day and give the janitor a break(day off).He/She shouldn't have to pick up after us. We should make sure we don't make a mess and if we do then we should pick it up. Its also good to tutor Children so they can become a smarter person. They can be come the next president of the United States. Sometimes community service takes a long time but it is worth it if you are helping the world or just making a kid even more smarter then what they were. If we can make our Community a better place imagine how much we can change the world.

1C6B45AF8116,"WHY I THINK STUDENTS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE

yes I think students should be required to community service because if they do they would be helping the community a lot and it could teach people how to start caring more about there community and probably do some community service there self.

students can make a difference in there community they just need somebody to show them how to do it.

another reason why i think students should be required to do community service is for bad behavior or vandalize school property and so they can learn that things like that won't help get the community better it will just make it worse.

another reason is that it would help the men and women who have to clean and pick up trash every day.

if we don't recycle and pick up trash it will make the community worse to and if you have a bad community then you have a bad city a bad county and a bad state and a bad environment so it would help if students would take some time out and volunteer to do community service to help the planet.",2,Community service,Independent
2C1D74F72797,"Dear Principal,

I think all children should have to do community service because it will help others and I know that once someone does community service it will make them feel good about themselves. The people that they help will also, feel good and thankful. This can make a better community because everyone will want to help out everyone else. There will be more respect for one another. There must be respect, people now are just trying to tolerate others and not respecting them because of how they are by seeing them and not seeing what they are like on the inside. We need to help one another and our environment to make it a better place to live. The respect and community service will help it all change.

Community service also, will help our school by giving it a good reputation, being known for helping our community. It can also, help our school by making it look better because someone may do community service hear and make our school cleaner. Someone can also, do community service hear by painting murals or even touching up some of the paint around the school. This is an excellent idea and do not try and doubt yourself because it can help what happens here.

Everyday can help our community just by doing the little things it takes, no one should not have to miss out on the opportunity on helping out. It helps out our school. It helps out the environment. Finally, it helps out the community. Maybe one day we will have a safe place to live and go to school. Everyday will be a better day, so jump at the opportunity to help everyone and everything.

I'm sure that they would want a clean community and have something nice around them. Some littering can cause bad air quality. That just depends on the litter. Also it's better to have a nice environment. If i had things to do that was not been told, i' d be picking up litter and many things for the community would look nice when people are passing by. Also all students should be required to perform the community service. Also it doesn't take that much time is others are helping. The when everything is cleaned up, that's when you can do anything the children wants. Like for example: play in the dirt, run around, play with the equipments that's around there community, or listen to music and other many playful games. Well that's all i think about how you should require all students to participate in the community service.",2,Community service,Independent
B765274CA182,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe requiring students to perform community service is a spectacular idea.

Helping out the community around us is so generous and all 600 students here at SCHOOL_NAME

could really make a huge impact.

It will teach many of us lessons that we will carry throughout life.

To begin with, generosity and benevolence are both great traits to possess.

Having the opportunity to help out the less fortunate around us will help us learn how to have these characteristics.

There are many families and people in our community that don't have heat in this cold winter, can't afford groceries and food to feed their family, have lost their jobs, or don't even have a home to live in.

I believe we often take for granted what all of our privileges.

For instance, many kids are upset or get annoyed with all of the work at school.

However, we should be grateful for being able to get an education and learn so much.

Overall, I believe doing hours of community service and helping people is priceless.

Next, participating in this experience is bound to teach every single student a lesson that they will be able to apply to many circumstances in their future.

For example, one child could learn that giving is better than receiving.

This lesson could be taught by going to soup kitchens and donating goods, or even serving food at a homeless shelter.

Last year, a friend and I decided to give back to the community around us.

We volunteered at a local homeless shelter and served dinner to all of the people there.

Every time one of them would say, ""Thank you"" I would feel so excited.

To know that they appreciate simple act, meant the world to me.

Another lesson they could learn would be that everyone could make a difference.

If all 600 students at this school contributed in community service, a huge result would be seen.

Furthermore, students contributing time to help the struggling people in their community is such a great idea.

I believe that if students think that it is getting in the way of activities that they would rather do, they will learn after the first few times how much more other people and families need it.

All in all, students contributing time to do community service is a marvelous idea.

EE30FF826F46,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, yes i think that all of the students at SCHOOL_NAME should attend in this community service. I think so because if all of the students attend in this we all could be able to clean up to help each and other and maybe help the teachers clean up in their rooms or just help people in the clean up after school. I know i' m one the students that doesn't like working or working for someone but i want to help our community keep our world a better place. Like for an ex: I'm walking down the hall way and i see paper fall and i pick it up, or i see someone in the hall way and someone drops their books i can stop and help them pick it up. That will make you and that person feel good inside and even make you feel good. It will you feel like you want to help other people. IF someone is crying or need someone to talk to your rite there to talk to them, to let them say what bringing them down or something they had on their mind all day and they want to tell someone but they cant because no one wants to hear what have to say. That's another way that you can help someone too. Now if non of the students don't participate in the community service thing then we will have a very bad school, or a bad location to live at because no one helps each other. They will always be fights and arguments because nobody cares about anybody's feelings. Doing this may take up my time but it is worth helping people and our community. Maybe in my older years i could come back down to the 8th or maybe the 1st grade and tell the kids how my life was when i was in there grade, and how i wouldn't listen or talk back to the teachers and stuff like that but when get older you will realize that all that could of been better.

Hello! I was wondering if you have made your decision on the community service projects.

So if you are not going to require that students to do community service than you have made your decision and I can not change that. if you require community service than thank you. You have just helped a person in the community that needed help. One time when I was doing community service, one of the people that i was helping came up to me and thanked me for what i was doing and she said that i would be greatly rewarded someday. i think that you should require community service because not all people have the same things as us and they need to learn that life can be very hard. I want people to experience what it feels like to help someone in need. I know some people that already do community service and they love it they say that it is a good thing to do and they enjoy helping people in need.

Community service is a great way to keep kids occupied and out of trouble. However the kids of SCHOOL_NAME don't get in trouble very much so this is not required. you could issue it as a punishment to kids that misbehave repetitively to keep them out of trouble. One may argue that community service is good for the kids. However they will have to do thirty hours of community service to graduate SCHOOL_NAME so they will be getting this experience in SCHOOL_NAME.

Dear Principal:

I STUDENT_NAME think that you should do some community service i think that it is a very nice thing to do and also to be helping others. And be a good thing even also to be role model to other little kids. Helping the community is a very nice thing to do even if their is people that criticized you and either way you could even get credits to where ever high school to go you. Showing that you are a nice and educated person.

Some people don't like to be doing community service because they say it takes time from your weekdays or that its too long and also I cant go because i have a party to go to. And so far their is many other excuses about not able to do community service. For example they are even little kids who do community service because they know they are helping other people and not just them. What they don't know or some of them do know that they could be getting credits for high school and that could really help in for what ever classes you are. But its your decision of doing the community service the choice is up to you.

But in this case me writing this letter its not my choice if we should everybody do community service. And if we do i really hope if we could be getting some credits for that would be a wonderful thing to have. That would be a good thing that every body could do for something nice. Write me back when ever you have a chance please tell me if we are gonna have. Hope if we could have it at least for a time.

I think that students shouldn't be required to do community service because there family might not have time or maybe there parents wont let them. I think it would be nice for some children to help out but they shouldn't have to. The children should not be responsible to take on actions on doing other peoples stuff because it might have not been them who either littered or did something that the person that did this action should be responsible for it. Children should only be required to do community service if they have served time in jail and is required by the law or they are doing it for a good cause like when they have to do it at there school so they are ready for college and have to learn what their life is going to be about. So that's some of the reasons why i think that kids shouldn't have to take on doing community service. Taking time to do community kind of takes away being able to be a kid because you don't really get to hang out with friends and family , you don't get to have your own time and you might not have time to do your homework and that might cause you to have failing grades which even takes away more of your privilege's to hang out with friends or have your own time so i think that being required to do community service shouldn't be allowed unless you have done something so that you have to do community service. All though community service looks good on your college application so children should try to participate with community service but shouldn't be required at least you should wait until the kids are a senior in H.S. to start require community service.",3,Community service,Independent

Community service is a outstanding activity to do .During community service you helps others and in some situation the environment. I believe it also help the development and growth of a young adult. Sometimes i believe that when the students hear community service they think of exhausting hard work. Yet if we tell the students that community service can be doing the simplest thing. I'm sure they couldn't deny it.

So community service is an awesome experience for anyone.

Community service can be a simple as picking up waste that you have seen just lying on the ground. Community service can also be u taking care of younger children at a day care center. So some community service can be fun, you just have to adventure out and give it a chance. Like with me and my friends say we see a plastic bottle or can well pick it up, search for nearest trash can and play a game of basketball. So we should at least have students try some community service first then see if the like it or not.

Community service also isn't a solo job. You can do community service with a groupof.

Your friends u all can go around picking up trash and throwing it away. Also the community service you do can help others and yourself. like how u pick up trash thrown in your yard do the same elsewhere.

So I do believe community service should be done with the students in our school. It is a good dead and should be done.

Students may not like it at first but after a while they will get used to it. Community service will do our students good it will also do the community well

I think you should not make it mandatory that we do community service because there is just no time in the day.

We have to do all of our homework, our extra curricular activities and study for the many tests we have.

In school our teachers give us at least 2 sheets of homework a night plus studying for the many test we have. I would typically have 2 test a day so that is an extra 2 hours of studying i have to do at minimum. If I don't get the subject matter i have a test on then i will have to just keep on studying until i get it, including re-reading and practice/

Also, we have extra curricular activities we do. For example; Football, Cheer leading, Cross country and more. We do these sports and activities to help our concentration and our physical strength.

The students at your school do not have the time for more requirements to do. I, for one, would end up worrying about getting all my requirements done then study for tests at 3 in the morning because then I would have completed all my home work. And by the time I finished studying I would be able to get about 1 hour maybe 1 hour and 30 min. I would end up coming into school about to fall asleep on my desk or on the floor.

I do not think that students should be required to do community service. I believe that it should be a choice but only under certain circumstances. If they choose to be in a club or any other school activity that requires them to do community service then they would have to or be kicked out of that club, if not then they should not have to. The only reason that a student should have to do the community service when they are not in a club is if they got into some kind of trouble at school or during something related to school/on school grounds or if they accumulate so much detention that they don't make up another choice should be community service. Another reason they could do community service is if they want to help out the community but not because they have to do it as punishment or to as curriculum for a club.

One of my examples is that if people that were on a soccer team or any other team did something that got them in trouble and they would not be given detention for is they could do community service instead. Another example is that if a student had accumulated over 24 hours of detention and it was close to the end of the school year or a dance/ field trip that they really wanted to go to was coming up they could just make it up with the amount of community service that you and other faculty members decide is fit for the circumstances. My final example is that a student could have a friend that is having trouble with math and they want to help their friend they do community service and help their friend with whatever he or she would need help with or if they see a park that is full of litter they could help clean it up. Maybe doing that the student could get extra credit to help their grade if they need to push it up a little. Those are some of my reasons that I think a student would have to do community service.

My friends do not like community service they think it is a waste of time and energy.

I say that they shouldn't have to do community service if they don't want to.

community service is about giving and doing in your free time not in time given to you or being forced to.

then they do the job with a frown and a groan for example say my friend OTHER_NAME is helping the elderly with OTHER_NAME.

OTHER_NAME likes doing this so he helps during school after school and during the community service class he happily does it with a smile on his face. OTHER_NAME will only do this if he has to and, during this job he will moan groan talk back and slack off.

I am writing you a letter based on the topic of you wanting to make community service a requirement for students at our school.

I think you making community service a requirement is a great idea. I know from experience that kids need to do community service. I think that it makes kids become better people and it helps their community too. Even if its a simple task like donating a can of food to a homeless shelter, I still think it is a good thing for students. Especially ones who can't seem to stay out of trouble. It sometimes even helps people get through a tough time just by seeing themselves put a smile on somebody's face.

I know that this will help kids and the community because I have experience with it. My neighbor has always been a trouble maker at school and in the community. But one day he got in trouble for something he did and he had to do community service hours. He learned that helping out people is a good thing to do and instead of doing bad things and breaking the rules, he helps out at a homeless shelter or organizes groups to pick up trash.

That is a reason that we should make community service a requirement at our school. And if our school starts requiring it, other schools in our town could start requiring it. Sooner or later, tons of schools around the world could be helping out their community and making the world a better place to live in.

I'm tired of seeing trash on the side of the road or people not caring about what's happening in their community. With your help I think we could change that in our community and even other communities around the world.

Community service is something that most people that like to help clean up there neighborhood do. some people prefer to spend there time doing thing that help there self. Some times community is for people that do things wrong and expect to get away with it. So there county make them do so many hours of community service to pay off debit. I think that is why some people choose not to do community service. so other people shouldn't force this on them if they haven't done anything wrong, they just choose not to do community service. It may also be that they have a busy schedule and can't make time to do community service at that point in time. Maybe if you tried other ways of asking people to volunteer like putting a sign up sheet in the main office or forming a pto to help clean up. showing the importance of some things can change peoples minds on how they look at something. Also showing someone how good it feels to do something good for some one else in there neighborhood, can change their minds about doing something like community service.

In my opinion community service helps every body if its teaching them that they shouldn't do bad things or helping clean up the earth.

Community service is a good thing that shouldn't be looked at like a punishment. so show them that just because your doing his doesn't mean your in trouble it just mean you like help taking care of your neighborhood.

In my opinion, community service is wonderful. Cleaning up our planet is a righteous thing to do. However, other students here are not as enthusiastic as I am about it. Just the thought of cleaning up litter in our school gives me joy. Besides, community service is important. Students should participate.

For getting students excited about community service, I have a plan to propose to you. What if we create a game that has to do with this subject? We can give a large prize to the person who did the most amount of community service in school, their neighborhood, or at home. Each student will receive a log to write down how many hours they did in the course of two weeks. We can begin this on March 7th. The deadline should be March 21st.

For the grand prize, we could give out a ten pound bag of assorted candies for the winner to share, or have for themselves. What do you think of this plan? This is a rough draft. If you like this plan but think there could be some tweaking, do as you please. I will be waiting for your reply.

B8DB83873319,"Dear Principal,

I have heard you are requiring for all students to perform some type of community service. There are those who think community service is great and very important, but there are also those who think it will waste their time and keep them from doing something more important to them. Some students have already done some community service and others refuse to do so. Let me tell you why I think you should continue with your plans to require everyone to perform community service. Community Service should be done by everyone because it helps the community itself, it helps each one become a better person, and it gives a better chance for those who plan to go to college.

Doing community service means doing something for the people in the community or doing something to help the community itself. Performing community service would help people everywhere. A type of community service is to pick up litter and if it were performed by some hundreds of students, then our streets would be cleaner and our environment would be safer. People would have to breathe in more clean air without the garbage scattered everywhere on our grounds. It would also help out animals who have died from the filth at their habitats.

Performing community service will also help each one become a better person. We'll become nicer people who are more involved with our society. We would become kinder seeing how every plan to help makes everyone else happy. It will open our eyes to see how helping others also helps ourselves. Everyone would be a more respectable, kinder person than before. It would make us more helpful.

With community service required from every student, everyone would have a better chance of receiving scholarships during high school. Community service is greatly demanded from every university/college and starting from an early age, we would make ourselves get a better opportunity. Those who thought they wouldn't get as good a chance because of their grades could now see they do while doing community service. Those who had the grades to get in have an even better chance with the requirement of community service.

Many would complain and tell you not to require community service of them because they say it will waste the time they could've used to do something more important to them. Well, let me tell you that is not true. If someone is organized, which we all should be, then one can plan their schedule nicely to do what they seem as important to them and still do some community service. It is not a waste of time nor does it keep anyone from doing their other regular activities.

So you see, you really should require community service to us students. I highly agree with you on this. It will help the community we live in, it will help us become better people, and it will get us a better opportunity to a college we would like. Don't let those who think community service is a waste of time change your mind. Go right ahead with your plan, it will only make us better.",5,Community service,Independent

I have to say that choosing labored work over being an unrespectable student towards helping the community just shouldn't fit with out school. Kids need an education and a respectful attitude to continue on in life. Some examples would be; getting a job, giving love to your community, and showing young kids a good role model.

When getting a specific job as a teen is simple, you can work at Burger King, McDonald's, or any other fast food restaurant, and knowing you have good spirit in your heart for cleaning the community shows one person what a real change can do. Being a positive affect on people around you, friends or family members, can show them to clean up a mess here or there. It brings a joy, when an older person, knows what they can do to bring that joy in the job they gave that one young child. If one chooses not to have a job, to live life without a show of care, then they aren't getting anything and are affecting people around him or her with that negative affect, which makes people not care or make a person hate on what should be loved.

Giving love to your community is simple. All a person has to do is show it! When you clean the community, it knows you really want a good change on that one place. The community is dirty all the time, so why not stop being lazy and put on some gloves and put on a changed attitude. Going outside or inviting friends can be successful on how one cleans up. Maybe, you want to pick up a wrapper on the floor, or throw away that dirty shoe someone lost at the park. Growing up loving the community puts a positive change in everything around your life. One may want to clean around their house and let other people have something worth looking at. Now is the time to clean your school's yard, or your yard at home.

Young kids don't know what they are doing when they drop garbage on the ground, but with a strong older brother or sister, telling them what's wrong with that being there can show there minds, ""oh, I shouldn't be throwing stuff on the ground, it's wrong!"" And it turns their brains for the greater good in life. When a young kid doesn't know what's up, then they won't be positive, but a negative. They will treat the world, like it never matters, and destroy what other people love in the community. Many people won't want that affect and try to teach their kids right from wrong. It brings out a strong change when a child has a role model to help them out.

Now, I know that many students still won't change from one letter, but principle its up to you, and how you change the students in this school. I will try and put that positive affect on people who think with negative minds, but I rest assure this paper should change some hearts. Showing love, having a good job and being a good role model is what the community needs from this point on.",3,Community service,Independent
2375E96B7653,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think that my school and I should be required to do community service. I also think it should be a choice for students to say whether or not they want to do it, like putting out a flyer or asking if they would like to help clean it up or something to that nature. The reason i think this way is because some students i know, including me does litter and don't think nothing of it, and its not a good thing. but then again we are 8th grade students and yes we know right from wrong but some students don't mature like others. And I know a lot of people that wouldn't help. But if u asked me I would be more than happy to help pick up around the community. Sometimes I pick up things and my friends ask me why I'm doing it, and it kind of offends me but i just roll with the roll. So that might be an reason why some students don't want to help out, because they think it is uncool or their to cool to be picking up litter after others. And i can come up with many more reasons why some student wouldn't help. But i have to stay positive. Well i do think that student should be required to pick up litter around the community, but my thinking has a limit.",2,Community service,Independent

I am writing this letter to you about if students at SCHOOL_NAME should be require to do Community Service or not. While some students already have community hours and some don't, I think that we should be required to have community service hours. Some many say It takes up my time, or i don't have time to do anything for the community, but i think that that's just a excuse. If all students in the school had at least two hours of community service i think that our community would be a little better. While some kids already have done things for the community like volunteer at schools, fire stations, neighbors or just cleaning up the trash around your neighborhood, others think that

Most people don't care about how there neighbor hood is or about the community, what is more important is that it helps others out and that's what community service is all about. I do think that we should be required to have community service hours, if its only one hour or two hours of service at least.

I also think that it would be a great idea at our school if we make a group of students and get together twice a week and go clean up around the school or around the neighborhood. Most schools are not IB schools like our school is, but being a IB school i think we should be required IB (community service) hours.

I think students should be required to perform community service. So we can make this world better by cleaning up litter. The most important is teaching kids how to learn. helping them do better in class. We can make students become smarter. Teach them what they need to know. Teach them from wrong to good. They need the education that they are giving. To actually become something in the world. LITTERING! Is everywhere. Papers are on the ground. They throw there trash on the ground like if someone is going to pick it up. So is good that community service make them pick up trash. So they can keep the ground clean. So those who think its important it is. Some people don't have respect for the world they live in. Those who think is bad i guess they like living in a dirty place. But that is a great way to help world. Helping people clean up the streets. Sidewalks that people walk on. Doing the best for are community. So i will like to help do my community service. THANK YOU!!

AC31C0D7AFCA,"Community service is A great way to help out, otherwise it would not be A community. People think it is just cleaning, that plays a decent amount in it but it is way more than that like the question stated volunteering to help elementary students, there are many different activities and I am sure there is one that suits you. The community is in which the place you live, love, respect. So you should not think of it as giving to, but as giving back.

You should not be asked or requested upon you should want to. Your community should be the place where you felt like you were on top of the world along with the others. A whole neighborhood you can call family. You be able to grow up, come back and be like this is where i am from and not have to hide it.

So why think of it as community service, you clean up your home so why not call it home cleaning. People think you should be able to get rewarded for doing it, I bet that place gave you the best years of your life and if not then you probably were not meant to be there.

So do i think you should do community service I vote yes, and you should to.",2,Community service,Independent

I would like to tell you about how I think about doing community service. The reason I wanted to tell you about this is because I understand that some students would like to do community service and not others. In my opinion I think there should be a reason why some of the students want to do community service and not others. If the students that want to do community service can do that. If there is only a small group of people than it would not be a good way to have the work done. Please consider this and if you don't like this than it will be fine to me. My other reason is not everyone would like to pick up liter. It might not be what students want to do during there free time. I understand that your the principal of this school and not every principal would consider this opinion because you believe that everyone should do community service. I all so understand that it is very important to do community service around the school and you can learn many things from doing community service and I also like to tell you that there should be a list of places that there going to do service at.

F537EA7DEE8E,"Dear Principle,

I personally think that you should require all the students from our school to do community services for many reasons. One reason is that it will teach you a lesson , also that it will keep students from doing bad things and it will influence younger kids to do not litter because if they do they will have to do community serves also in the future.

Doing community services is good for you because you are helping others and helping others will show you how people are in need wich will lead to energies wich will be used to help others in the future.

The other reason is also that it will keep students from being outside. Being outside of your home means that there are people that don't want you and that will lead you in the bad path and doing community serves will keep you from going in the bad direction.

The last reason why i think that you should require all students to do community serves is that it will influence little kids to not litre because then they will do community serves",2,Community service,Independent

Personally i think everyone should be required to perform at least some community service. It may not be the most fun thing to do, but everyone should help out their community. Think of the human body, if not all of the parts of the body did their job the human would not function correctly. It may even fall apart. Imagine if the lungs or heart didn't work. What would happen to the system then? Everyone needs to help out and do something good for their community.

If it weren't for some people's hard work, there would not be a lot of fun things to do in some places. Here in Somerset we have a skating rink, a mall, a playground and many other things to do for fun. I think since we use those places and live in this community we should repay them by cleaning up a park, painting a fence, or volunteering for your local animal shelter. Sometimes its just good character to help someone out, not asking for anything in return. I think that if you as a principal wants to teach kids how to be respectful and helpful, then community service is a great way to do it. Even if its just making posters for the school or planting flowers out back, it not only makes the people that do it feel good about themselves seeing their work being displayed, but it also makes the school look better.

I think that some people look at community service in a negative way because it can be used as punishment. People shouldn't be forced into helping out their community. They should view it as a great honor and something fun to do with friends.

Something else you might want to consider when doing community service is to relate it to something you enjoy. For example over the summer I volunteered at the animal shelter. I absolutely love animals so

I had a great time feeding, walking and playing with the cats and dogs that lived there. I met my special friends there too. I was cleaning a tawny colored cat's cage one day and I noticed he had six toes rather than five. I was intrigued by this and was eager to see him again. The next day when I was supposed to feed him I ended up giving him the name ""Six-Toed Joe"". Throughout the summer me and that adorable six-toed cat bonded. I even ended up adopting him and bringing him home at the end of the summer.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is this: Community Service in my eyes is definitely a yes because everyone needs to help out and it may even teach you a valuable lesson. Plus, its also a self-confidence booster when you see the good things that you've done around your community.

9E52C6A0876E,"Dear, Mr. Principal there are many reasons why students should perform community service . To begin with, for example, today people in the United States are throwing trash around our communities and not knowing what might happen to our world as a person I also, like eating and drinking but when your done you really have to clean up your area where you have been sitting. Next, many people that i know of in our school don't care about our work place or about our outside grounds and we should make them clean the most because they are the ones that did this to our work place. On the other hand, those students that are excellent in school and responsible/respectful to their work place should do less community service because they are all experiencing the problems like I already told you for example, throwing trash in playgrounds and throwing a wrapper when no one is looking in the cafeteria and those students like me do community service hours by picking up trash or papers when they see it in the hallways and they also, are responsible for their work they do in the classroom for example, they push in chairs, they clean up their area workplace and finally, they are responsible for everything that they do. Lastly, community services hours are very important for our nation to last long in the future and be clean of garbage's and filthy areas!",2,Community service,Independent
310201844A5A,"dear principal, do you think that our school needs to have community service? i think yes because it represents the school and more students want to go to our school. for last for the students to have a time of fun. therefore community service is important to help us in our future.

to biging with, community service represents the school because people look at us and say good kids they are the people that we need for our future not because that only also, we are helping the planet and peoples too.

secondly, more people want to come to our school why?

because of the things that we are doing to help others and that education that is in the school and programs that are in the school that helps you be the best of all.

finally, the community service the students could have more time of fun. because you have your friend there to help you and to have fun with them as you and them do the community service.",2,Community service,Independent
A86C5A5446BD,"Dear Principal,

Some of my friends perform community service and have been telling me about them. I am very impressed with them. Community service is important. Its important for the people were giving servicing to and to us. Have you ever thought about requiring community service for students? I believe it would be a great thing to do! Not only could it make the students more responsible it could also make them more involved with the community.

Places we could visit could be the local library to read children's books to kids. We could also help out with bad housing and rebuilding. There are plenty of students who I know would love to do that! We could go visit retirement homes and company the retired folks. This all gives us a way to support this community and to show we really do care! After all the community as done for us, I think it should be required to have community work done.

This could be a good thing for us(the students)as well! Community service is put onto an application and you are looked at more by colleges. The community service would help more students get into colleges and would help people who need the service too. This is an opportunity to learn responsibly and to learn respect. We would get a chance to meet new people and to hear some stories from reality and to tell some stories on our own. It would give ourselves a chance to make something for someone. To make someone else feel good while we feel good as well.

If you could please think about everything I said in this letter and put community service into consideration, that would be great! I believe as a school we could we really do this and as a community as well. Making it a requirement would mean people would have to do it and it could possibly change some people. You never know what it could do but I believe it will be an excellent thing for you to do! Thanks for everything.

I agree with your decision on making the school body perform community service because sometimes in life there are things that you are not going to always want to do or agree with, however we still have to do it. As children, if we do not learn to make those wise decisions on our own then that may corrupt our future.

For an example, what if you decided to always let us have our way and we got use to that. Once we became an adult and get a good education, life is not going to be that simple. Like the saying ""What ever doesn't kill you, makes you stronger"".

By doing something we do not chose to do wont hurt you, it makes you grow and become a bigger person. However, learning this method doesn't occur over night. It takes time and a lot of ""Laying down the law"".

Most parents do not teach this to their children, so who will? As their principal it is your duty to teach them the right and wrong ways in life. Some children look up to their principals, so wouldn't you want to be a good example for them? Even when you make bright decisions like these, they will not always understand and become furious with you. However little do they know you are helping them and at the end your hard work will pay off.

In conclusion some ideas are worth it, maybe not in the beginning but at the end they show not only the children's success but your as well.

Once they grow up and walk across that stage they will indeed thank you and you will then realize it for yours",3,Community service,Independent
458A9CBC087F,"Dear principle,

I personally don't think everyone should be required to do community service. first of all, we spend most of our day in school working hard so for us to get home and have to go right back out and work some more is not necessary or right. Don't get me wrong i don't have a problem with doing community service i just think we need as much free time as we can get. On the other hand, Some students don't really have anything to do or look forward to at home and some of us do. I have football practice, track practice, and even basketball practice i wouldn't have the time to do community service even if i wanted to.

Some kids are in conditions were they cant do community service maybe because they're going through problems at home or they don't have an adult around to push them and encourage them to do the right thing. In high school its a requirement to have a certain amount of community service hours so if i don't se the point of us doing it now if we just going to have to do it all over again.

In conclusion i think us students should be able to decide if we want to do community service or not because some of us either cant do it or just don't want to do it. So if our principle is forcing us to do something that we really don't want to do then its most likely not going to be done.",3,Community service,Independent

I think community service is a waist of time for us young people because we got things to do also. For example i take care of my niece and nephews right after school for 2 hours or 3 some times. I take care of them because my sister works all day and there's nobody too take care of the kids. And sometime she don't work. So when she doesn't i go to my moms job and help her out. So im always busy . Specially theses pass few weeks because my 15 is coming up and i have to be going to stores to buy stuff and we get home so late that we are starting to go to sleep late like at 1 or 2am. Another example one of my friends gots basketball practice every day after school at the park. There's alot of examples more, that's why i think community service is a waist of time. And i don't think yall principals should not make us do community service.",2,Community service,Independent
EE6826C8E470,"I don't think that we should have to do community service. I think that the people that do should be able to get rewards or something. Cause sometimes some people cant they might be busy or they don't feel good or stuff like that. That is my opinion, but the people that do should get things. maybe things for school or stuff for sports or anything.

We could even have it where like every hour you do you get something and when you get so many of them you could turn them in for something else. Or once a month or however often, one ticket from each person gets put in a drawing and if there name gets drawn then they get a big prize.

It could be like a club for the school. Where kids meet up after school or before school and go and do things for the community. To make it look nice or even tutoring little kids anything helps and they would no that they are doing the right thing.",2,Community service,Independent
1F7354AA60CE,"TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that the students taking community service is a good thing. I also believe it shouldn't be required to take community service. I think that because community service is for volunteer workers and students shouldn't have to do something against their will. On the upside of the topic I believe it would help the students learn how they can help the community.

For example, a student who doesn't like the community service might try and mess up the environment that their working in just because they don't like what they are required to do. It would also have an effect on peer pressures because the kids who do like the community service could get pressured to be a nuisance just like the kids who don't like the service. The children who do like the community service could get bullied because they actually enjoy the schools new program. Most children might have to many extra curricular activities to complete there hours of service.

This is why I think that community service should be optional for the students who want to do it. For the students who wouldn't like to participate in this activity they should have an alternative. The alternative should be somewhat like community service so it is equal with work that the other students are doing. The people doing community service wont stop because the think the alternative for the other students is easy.",3,Community service,Independent
