7D2794FBFEB4,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I know that you are contemplating on whether or not students should be required to perform acts of community service. As a former student, I believe that community service should be required by all middle school students. Today community service helps me greatly. With all of the stress of being ""Mother Nature"", it is very hard for me to clean and inspect each and every nook and cranny. My former friends OTHER_NAME, and OTHER_NAME make it harder and harder for this beautiful planet that we call Earth to survive.

Some people argue that students shouldn't be required to do complete acts of community service. They say that community service is for "" janitors"" and ""convicts"". I think that they are wrong! Those who are say nay to community service are just saying yes to global warming and pollution. Community service is not just an job for janitors and convicts, it is a deep statement of opinion. When you complete community service you're saying "" I believe in bettering my country, my planet, and my life.""

Another common argument you hear associated with community service is the time. It takes to much time out of your day, you don't have time to relax. How can you sit and say that? You're wasting time just standing there. OTHER_NAME and new batches of friends are making messes that I can't clean in a day, and instead of helping, you wonder how much time it will take out of your life. When you refuse to help by doing community service, you're just insisting that your life be cut short. Think about that the next time you worry about the time.

Who's to say that community service can't be fun? Don't knock it till you try it. Community service is a great way to meet new people who are also trying to better the earth. It not only helps clean the earth and lengthen your life span, it creates new bonds and friendships as well. I remember when I first met ""Rain"" and ""Sun"", they helped make clean up of OTHER_NAME and her gangs messes so much easier. My first act of community service in elementary school was picking up trash from our playground after field day, and I've been doing it ever since.

I know you may think, community service is boring, community service is for janitors and convicts, I won't be able to hang out with my friends if I do community service. You're wrong! Community service is a great way to meet people, it's a great way to lengthen you're life span, and a great way to clean up the planet. If this doesn't convince you that community service should be required for all students to graduate, nothing will. Please think about this not just for you, but for future generations. See you next month OTHER_NAME.

Sincerely,

I think that students should be involved in community service because then it gives other schools good examples on how great our school is. And it also sets a good example. If we do community service then we are helping our environment and grow big as a society. We will be helping the earth and stop pollution.

If all students perform it then the more help there will be to help out. My idea is to have groups of people every week to stay after school and do community service. Students can pick out the people they would like to work with and turn a sheet in for what team they are on and what grade and then the teachers will set out who goes with who, depending on the number of how big the group is then it will all be sorted out.

That's one way of doing it and then the other thing that might interrupt that is if they are in after school activities then those kids wont have to do it but when their activity is over with for the year then they will have to be in the week they are called in to doing community service.

And every Friday instead of having advisory we can try and clean up the community, like, picking up bottles, paper, cans, and any kind of garbage that might be on the ground.

Like I said before this can make a big difference in the world and make not just students but every one to actually care about how our environment looks and feels like.

Just like my mom always tells me ""If you want you're room to be clean all you need to do is clean it up.""

I always think about that saying that my mom tells me when i think about cleaning the environment.

But i really do think that you should follow this idea it might take along time but its all worth it if you're helping something be strong again.",3,Community service,Independent

I believe making students do community service wouldn't be a good idea. Yes it is helpful to the community but it would have to be an outside of school assignment and many parents wouldn't be very thrilled about that. Some families do not have the money to take their kids places for community service or have the time. On top of homework, chores, and family things some students may feel overwhelmed. Then if it did not get done then it may mean an A or an F for that student making the student feel even more overwhelmed. The school would also have to take extra time to assign and organize the community service on top of their regular schedule.

An outside of school program for community service i believe would be a good idea. It would be like any other club or sport outside of school and students can take it willingly. If the students see that its easy to sign up and help out then i believe that more kids would help. Instead of adding stress onto the teachers and students day it would be easier to give the students and option. Not all students have time for community service but those who truly want to, have a chance.",3,Community service,Independent
2FA02A1E3654,"Dear Principle,

Community service should be performed by all students. Either picking up littler, or volunteering somewhere. The position that should be taken on this issue is positive.

Helping your community should be a reward itself, so why doesn't everyone help out? High schools everywhere have their students go out and log their community service hours. Doing and performing community service is a great act of kindness and should be done. Next, some community service projects can be as small as picking up random litter off the street, or as large as Habitat for Humanity. Helping people isn't a waste of time, sitting at home is a waste of time. Community service may take a long time or maybe even five minuets to complete. To graduate High School you have to have so many hours of community service, so why not start in Middle School? Maybe this will help someone find a career later in life that has to do with helping people.

In conclusion, the Principle should have their students do community service. It's not a waste of time, it helps students become more active and meet new people. Plus it doesn't just help out the students it help the community and the people in it, education of the outside world, and lastly it can help the school. Lastly, the stand I take on this is positive. I do believe that all students should and have to perform community service for the better.      ",3,Community service,Independent

Community service is a great thing to be a part of, but you shouldn't have to do it if you don't want to. Community service is a great way to better your community. I feel that if you are forced to do it you wont take as much pride in the work that you are doing and the community wont look as good as it could if you actually wanted to be doing it.

Doing community service is great when you decide to do it yourself. There are so many was you can help out with your own community whether it be planting a garden, or to help build a house for someone who's home recently got burned down. But if you don't want to than why should you have to.

I agree that community service should be done more often by people, but those people should be volunteers that want to make there community a better place. Not by people that were forced to do it because their principle made it a requirement.

Community service can be fun. You and a friend can do it and be able to talk and have fun while helping out your own community, but if you just don't want to than no one should be able to force you into doing it.

I highly disagree with making community service a requirement. Yes community service is great like I have already said, but you shouldn't be forced to do it. It should be a personal choice that you make because you really want to make the community that you live in a better place and you know that you can help

Community service is a great way to show people that we care about the economy and what we can do for it.

Students should be able to sign up for community service on our school board or have teachers send out fliers to students.

Some student will be interested in helping the way our city looks.

It can make a difference all over the world.

I strongly say students should be required to do community service.

Hard labor would teach students how its going to be when your older and matured in your life.

The kids that would be working in community service can b have it on they're resume. Unlike other simpletons sitting around playing games all day.

This would bring them out of their shell and show them what it could be like and not be like if they are not looking forward in life. They wont have a choice but do community service and pick trash off the ground.

This can also teach them self-control and not be a dunce in life.

Having no self-control can commit to health and behavior problems.

Problems like serious crimes and injuries.

Community service can help their self-control and make them have a meaning in life.

Students will not be forced to do community service but they will have to do at least 2 days worth. It can make a difference in the world and in the community.

It doesn't only have to be cleaning up either.

They could do fundraiser's, mowing lawns, and even going to a retirement home and caring for the elderly.

I believe community service would be perfect for students our school and community.

Please recommend issuing community service our schools.

It has come to my attention that you may soon require all students to do community service as part of school. I am a busy person and I don't think you should add community service to the curriculum. I think that I have a better solution to this problem. Instead of requiring all students to do community service, you could simply put in classes that are dedicated to helping the community. That way, people who enjoy helping the community will be able to do it in school and be graded on it.

Another reason why I don't think you should require people to do community service is because some people already are required to do community service for other events. For example, as part of me being confirmed, all my classmates and I are required to perform 10 hours of community service. I also know many other people who have to do the same thing for religious groups and clubs. If you added community service to the school curriculum, it would only burden the lives of people who have many other obligations in their lives. That is what I think and I'm sure many others would agree with me.

However, if you were to require all students to do community service. It would be optimal if you made it a manageable number of hours. Or perhaps you could simply make it part of certain classes instead of doing it outside of school as I stated before. After all, I and many other students my age enjoy having time to ourselves away from school and it would really bog down our lives if community service was added to the already long list of things that a student must do in a day such as sports, clubs, homework, etc. I also think it would be unfair because I know many people who already have trouble getting there homework done as it is and adding community service to that would make it even worse.

Please consider the proposition I have made. As I think it will benefit us all in the long run. Do not add community service to the list of requirements of school.

I think it would be better to have every one should do community service. If every one did this i think our city would be cleaner and healthier. If we were going to do this i would want it to be during school hours. If we did it during school hours people couldn't say that it takes time away from there schedule like sports. Also if we did this during school hours people couldn't tell their teachers that we dent do our homework because we were to busy doing community service.

Another good reason to have every one in our school to do community service to help other kids. If we learned something and some else doesn't get it we could help them with what they don't get. Another good reason to do it during school hours if so someone need help with school work we can help them at school so we don't have to go to their house. Also so if we do it during school and not go to their house more people might want to help because if their at home they wont to take time out of their schedule to help someone.

If every one did it and not just a couple people couldn't make fun of other people for having to clean up trash or helping someone because they will be doing it to. If everyone did this they might be nicer in the future and help someone out because they have already done it once before. I hope you enjoyed reading my letter and taking it in consideration thanks.

Community service has become a heated argument across the school.

Some think it should be required for all students, while others think it would take too much time away from what they need or want to do.

Community service is a big part of a strong community and good citizens complete their share of it.

So, why wouldn't we require this at our school for all students?

There is no reason not to.

Our school needs to require all of the students to complete community service.

The purpose of the school is to create educated citizens that will work to improve their community.

We teach things like math, science, and social studies to complete this task, and we bring in educators from programs like CPR to help as well.

So now that we are educated, and can help ourselves, it is important we make time for helping other people.

Community service is an easy and fun way to do that.

Some people ask how community service could benefit our school.

Well, teaching kids to go out of their way and help others now will create habits to help others when they are an adult.

Learning about the hardships of others can also teach us to appreciate what we have and how lucky we are to have the homes and jobs we have.

When I went in to my church to help feed the homeless and play games with the kids it really made me thank my lucky stars that I was blessed with all I have.

Not only did I give thanks after I visited the homeless, I also made new friends.

Their names were OTHER_NAME and OTHER_NAME, and they were both nice kids.

With all of these benefits it is obvious to see that community service should be a requirement for all students at our school.

Amazingly, there are many more benefits to this idea.

Completing community service will keep students of the street and out of trouble.

Instead of doing drugs they will be making someone less fortunate feel loved and happy.

I have no doubt that a full stomach, warm place to sleep, and someone to play Life with made OTHER_NAME and OTHER_NAME happy.

It would have made any homeless person happy, and more and more of them can achieve that good feeling and healthy life style if more people complete community service.

In conclusion, community service should be required out of every student at our school.

If students say they don't have time, they can always make time.

If you don't do it for the school or the students, do it for the hundreds, maybe thousands, of people and families that will get a second chance in life.",4,Community service,Independent

Hello, I have notice you are thinking about requiring all students to perform community service. Some might agree with you because our community needs to be taking care of. On the other hand, others might degree because they believe community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. I would like to tell you why i believe that you should be required to perform community service.

Some agree that the community service is needed because we need to take care of our community.

It is very important to take care of the community. If we don't then our community would have litter all over the ground, elementary children need help and if we are not willing to help them then not good grades would be on their report cards. We don't have a lot of people helping in our community services so we need more helpers but the people we do have doesn't regret helping out and serving their job.

Other students however, believes that community service takes too much time away from things they want and need to do. Now a lot of students play sports and homework and etc. but maybe on days that they don't have anything to do or they have extra time they can service the community. Only if it is only an hour at the soup kitchen, I'm sure they wouldn't mind helping out even if it isn't a lot of time.

I believe that students should be required to perform community service because we need to clean up on community and help out. It doesn't matter if it is just an hour or if it is five hours, students need to learn to help out with the surroundings around us. I strongly believe that students need to be required because they will see the fun and great feeling of taking care of the community.

76D57BCC7A10,"dear principal of our school, community service should not be required in school, this is because some people who do not have a lot of time on their hands would go crazy trying to perhaps juggle school projects, homework, out of school jobs that take up most of their day. So tell me how all of our students who do all of these things and then would have to put community service on top of that i think not Mr. principal sir. that is just wrong. Now for someone who never does their school work does not have a job and just sits around on their lazy butts all day long those are the people that should be doing community service not the people that work as hard as they possibly can all day and barley have their eight hours of rest shouldn't be doing it the ""other guys should"".

So what I am thinking is to go to every teacher in the building and see what students work there hardest and what students don't and try to see who have after school jobs and who doesn't. and the people who do not work hard all day every day they should be the students doing community service not the hard working students.

What is community service to you? Is it something you absolutely have to do because someone told you that you have to, or is it a good service that you do out of the kindness of your heart? I don't know about you but i think that real true community service comes from the heart. This is why i do not think that a principal should tell you that you have to do community service for a grade but maybe he/she could nudge you in the right direction.

You shouldn't have to do service because someone has told you to because it is not service if you are forced into it or technically paid with a grade. As i said before it should be because you want to not because someone has told you to. You may think that it is alright to tell someone what they have to do because you think they need it. If they need it they will know deep down inside that they do.

I also believe that principals shouldn't get into their students personal lives, because some kids already have enough on their plate with homework, sports, clubs, etc. You may not even know that they work at a soup kitchen or help in a homeless shelter. There are many good Samaritans out there but they don't tell anyone because that would ruin it.

There are many good people in this world even if they don't do community service and that is why i believe that service should not be pushed onto kids heads. Principals may have power over them at school but they cannot decide for the students how to spend their free time. So you may not believe what i have said today but you might have, so i hope that i have made an impact on you today.",3,Community service,Independent

I think that student's should do community service because it help those that need help like old people and our community when they clean up trash and recycling it can also be fun like making games out of it like for example trash hokey were they use trash as the buck and trash cans as the goal. So I say that students should have to do community service even if does take time it can still be fun. I think the school should have a week that sponsor's community service and all the stuff people do to help our community they should get a day to play games that involve community service like trash hokey and other games like that because our community is great and we should keep it that way for along time to come and it doesn't have to be picking up litter it could be tutoring elementary school children during the after noon or helping the old do stuff like go outside and enjoy the fresh are and the sunshine that's the important stuff and the helpful stuff that we should all do every now and then.

I heard that you were deciding whether to require all students to perform community service.

Everyone has their different opinion on community service. Some people think that community service is very important, while others feel that it takes up too much of their time, based on what I have heard from my friends.

My suggestion is that I feel as if community service should be a requirement. Although some students find it a waste of time, it would be good to have everybody helping out their community. I feel that if the students are required to do community service, they might end up enjoying it and changing their views on it. Chances are they might end up feeling good about themselves after doing a good deed for their community. Plus, there are many different ways to serve community service. I think that the students that feel as if its a waste of time might find something they can do to help out their community and enjoy at the same time.

791E0902EAD5,"Dear principle, I don't think all of the students should have to do community service. I don't think all kids should do community service because I find that as a punishment for doing something bad. I don't believe all students should have to do community service because prisoners of jail have to sometimes do that. Or other naughty teenagers have to do that. So I don't believe good teenagers have to pick up trash or have to do any other subjects like that. Plus if a student signed up for football every day after school from 3-5 pm and community service is from 3-4 pm. What do the parents who paid all that money do know? The football organization doesn't give it back. The parents are out of that money and the child inst playing football which the money went to in the first place. So really it would be affecting the parents and the parents wouldn't be happy with you.

On the other hand if the students don't have any after school activities to participate in that would be a whole another story. If the students didn't have any after school activities to go to then nobody would be super mad except for maybe the students. If you made everyone do community service then all you would hear around the students is moaning and groaning from the students that don't like doing the community service. Student will eventually would want those after school activity's back and the kids will go to there parents and there parents will go to you asking what happened to those after school activity's?

AN alternative solution would be having a sign up sheet for kids and adults to sign up on if they wanted to do community service. Such as picking up liter and help tutoring children that need extra help in some that they may need help in.      ",3,Community service,Independent
DE4A7CBFD4DF,"dear principle, i believe this should NOT be mandatory to do community service.

in fact i think schools should only work with students School time and home work. any thing beyond that is not right. students go to school to learn not to be forced to do labor ""community service"".

Making it mandatory for students to go out on their time and do community service will cause problems with their agenda, home work ""projects, dead lines, work, etc"".

lets say a student is needing to catch up on a lot of work or they wont pass. so he figures out a schedule that will get all his work done.

but then he has to do community work for no reason, this might upset him because he can not get all his work done and he will not pass putting him into a depression.

now let me give you another example, say a student is unable to work, what if he is over weight and cannot bend down to pick up trash or cant walk around in the heat, does that mean he doesn't pass?

did you know that most young kids today are over weight and cannot perform those tasks, this idea is incorrect and will enter fear with a lot of things.",3,Community service,Independent
ECD81C1A4F62,"I think all the students could do the community work. That way not just one person is doing the work for everyone. Also if everyone does the community work it would be getting done faster and you wouldn't have to keep asking others to help. If all the students do the community work then that can help them realize and understand what needs to be done around our country/area. it will also teach the students to respect the planet we live on and not to litter or do something bad to something that is not ours. Maybe it would help teach the kids to work together and it would get them outside . It could show others that don't like to do work for others or pick up after them self's / others that if they all worked together they wouldn't have to worry about doing the work if they just didn't litter or vandalize others stuff that doesn't belong to them . So i take position to saying the principal to making everyone do community work even if its out side of school, just for maybe an hour maybe every other day, to get the students to learn to work together, get along and respect others property and belongings, help other kids that may be behind in something or just need a little more understanding in a subject some homework that they didn't quiet didn't understand at home that night.",2,Community service,Independent
2A16D21F4FC8,"Dear Principal,

Doing community service is a choice. Some kids want to do it, others think that its stupid. I don't think that there is any reason that you should have to force kids to do it but you should reward them for it. If you reward kids by doing community service say you give them some money it might inspire more kids to help out. This is a great idea because it doesn't force kids to do anything but it gives them a reason to want to help out. A reasonable ratio may be for every 4 hours of community service they get 20 dollars. Maybe a kid might want a new laptop and he's 40 dollars short. He could spend one long day working and he could get enough money to buy that laptop. Its a great and productive way to get kids to help out. Say that 10% of your school does community service now. If we add in the reward we could bump that up to 50%. It would make our town a much better healthier place. You may have noticed the trash on the soccer field behind our school. That could all be cleaned up if you offer this reward to the kids at our school. You could even offer it too adults. If we did that we would be the cleanest, smartest town ever. That definitely appeals to you considering you are the head of a school. You want all of your kids to do as good as good as possible in there school work. Your school could have the best grades in the state. Our town would be so amazing. So you can see how much encouraging kids to do community service is good for our school but forcing them, that's not going to help anything. If you force them to do community service then they wont put all of there effort into it. That could make the town even worse. Kids could start failing school on purpose in retaliation of being forced to do school work.

I agree we should clean up the entry school in end up clean like a whistle. The principal should lets take some breaks once for a while. When school is over we should stay at school until 5:00 p. m. therefore cleaning up the liter and stuff off the ground and throw it away in the trash can. We should have a break at 3: 50 to 4:15 p. m. that gives us plenty of time for a break.

But, let some people to go home so they can watch some of their favorite shows and play their video games. Once for a while they will come back help us because they did all their chores and their's nothing on TV. I will go home because I have to do chores and feed my animals.

I don't want anybody to come to this school and say "" This school doesn't look right because all this litter and trash all around the campus "", I would get up change the school picking up piece by piece unit it the cleanest school in Jefferson Davis County.

We should build a new break room full with snack bars, soda machines, and rooms for people so they can talk on break. It would be good if you give us a break between Ist and 2nd.

Community service is a way to distinguish selfish people from selfless people. Some people do large amounts of community service such as working at a soup kitchen and donating food to a food bank. Some even take it to the next level by going and helping out in places like Africa. Unfortunately not all people are open to helping people. At our school we should enforce that kids have to participate in community service at least twice a year.

Community service makes people feel better. It is a very moving experience when you give food to someone who is hungry. It teaches you to be appreciative of what you have after you see someone who has nothing. It also makes you feel good inside. Having community service might change the attitude of some kids at your school.

Some people think that community service is useless or a waste of time. But in reality it only takes up a few days a year of an average persons life. To only make the kids do two days of community service is no high price for anyone. It even doesn't take up the entire day, only a couple of hours.

Community service helps people, makes you feel better, and is not a humongous time consumer. Anyone who has some extra time should defiantly chose to do some. No one has a busy enough schedule do not be able to participate. As the principal of the school please require students to do community service.",3,Community service,Independent

I think that we shouldn't have to do community service if we don't have to time to do it. Say if we play sports we wouldn't have the time of day to it and if you make us do it on weekends kids might not show up or some might become upset with you. So i think you should let the kids pick or if they do it give the some extra credit . I play sports and I only have time to help on the weekends and sometimes i will be tried and many other kids who play sports might feel the same way as I do.

But if you do pick to make kids do community service I will understand why it helps kids learn to help out other people besides your self and some kids can really learn from just helping a couple of people out. But its up to you there are some positives and negatives with this choice.

I think we should take a vote to see how many kids would like to do community service and who wouldn't. If a lot of kids don't then let the kids who want to go out and help do it. For the kids who don't maybe they will change their minds if their friends tell them how fun it is because they still are hanging out even if they are helping people out while they are doing it. I wouldn't know which to pick for a while i would ask my friends if they do it to give me some positives and negatives on it. Then i would try it and see if i like it and if i do i will keep going along with this act.

So this is a hard choice for you to pick but i would just go by the vote of your students. Plus maybe a lot of kids will choose to do community service and you wouldn't have to make everyone do it . Since i wrote this paper I think i would vote to do community service and i think i would convince some more kids to go along with this just to see how it is. Then I see they whole school would come along to do this .

I heard that you are deciding on whether or not you want to make every student do community service. Some students do community service because they have to in some form of punishment.

I believe that if a student has done something wrong, for a punishment you should then make them do community service.

For example if a student breaks one of the rules and gets in a fight with someone at the school on school property, the punishment you could give them instead of suspension is community service.

Some students volunteer in community service because they like to help out the community if they have spare time. Usually when students volunteer in community service, it's because they want to.

Other students don't volunteer in community service because they feel like its a waste of their time and they won't be able to do what they want.

I don't think it's a good idea that you want to make sure every student performs some kind of community service because some students might be busy and not have time to perform any community service and if they don't, they will probably get punished even if it's not their fault.

So in conclusion of this statement, I personally don't think making every student perform community service is a good idea.

Of course they can do it if they are being punished but it shouldn't be required.

I think people should do community service if they really want to because you cant force a student to do something that they don't want to do. But in my opinion i think people should do community service at least once or twice a week so we are not destroying earth. Because people don't want to help earth become a better place, then that's how we suffer pollution which is a really bad thing for earth, and community service helps earth stay in good shape and it also keeps earth healthy.

Some people don't want to do it because they think they have more important things to do like make earth even more worse or hang out with friends. But if they could just use 10 minutes of there time to make earth a better place then we wouldn't have to do community service. There are more ways people wouldn't have to do community service and that is to pick up your trash and not litter and that is a really good example for doing community service and not doing it. But people just have to have enough patience to do it, but no, they just don't want to get there hands dirty so that's why they don't want to do it.

But i say we should do community service, but not every day just maybe two times a week so that way people wont cry on how boring it is to do community service. Some people agree with me because they don't want earth to be a bad place. But some don't because they just don't want to do anything because they are lazy. I say that everyone in the school should get outside for five minutes and help clean up so they don't have to whine about how boring it is to take turns cleaning up after each other. But that's my opinion, i think that you should just collect other peoples paper and see who wins these community service crisis.",3,Community service,Independent

What I think about community service is something that a lot of people do around the world. In church school the nuns tell the people in church school to do community service do that we help the nuns in everything or we clean the garbage that is thrown in the floor. My friend OTHER_NAME use to do community service when he was still in church school he was dong community service. I never did that when I was in church school. Some people say is fun cause you meet new people and you learn new things in the world. People that I know still do community service. They say that sometimes they get paid when they do something. you could even do is when there is snow on the ground and nobody have shoveled the snow you should do it . If the person was a old person and they cant do it themselves.

We help other people that's something nice you could do. I help a little second grader do his homework but he has problems. When he's writing his hand start to shake a lot now is a year helping him now his hand doesn't shake at all. His parents say that he have learned a lot of things from me and I'm happy that they say that. My mom say to thank god that I got that job now I could buy something with my own money that I need to buy in school or clothes or shoes that I want. That's why when I grow up I wanna be a teacher I'm learning to be a teacher with the little kid. It's fun and you remember everything that you did in elementary school. Sometimes you forget but you remember or the little kid shows me.

People could even help the old person taking they're grocery to the car. You could do a lot of things for community services. You could wash the dishes for your mom or clean the house. they're a lot of things you could do. I think that Ms. TEACHER_NAME

should let us have community service. People are lazy to do community service. Because they just wanna chill around with they're friends and they don't do they're homework. I do my homework every Friday I don't like doing it Saturdays or Sundays. I always get lazy or I go and chill with my friends. My mom doesn't like me being in the house locked so she lets me go outside and chill with my friends or I go with her to go shopping to the mall or we go to my brother house. I use to like being locked now I don't cause my head starts to hurt I feel like if I was in jail.

I think that students should be required to do community service.

So that instead of students always doing things for themselves they should do something for someone else for a change. I will say this to all the students.

Why stay in the house all day playing video games, doing nothing, just watching television? When you could be helping someone in need or help the environment get healthy

One way you can help your community is by planting a tree, giving food to the homeless, volunteering at an animal shelter or a homeless shelter.

You maybe want to change your life but help someone change theirs. How would you feel if you really needed help or wanted to make a change but no one will help you and no one will support you in any way what so ever, what do you think will happen to you if your homeless or don't have enough oxygen because you never tried to plant a tree not a day in your life?

I believe our school should have community service.

Why ?

Because, students should not litter on school property and make our school look trashy.

School is a place to learn not to litter and destroy the schools .

In the following paragraphs, I will persuade you to require school community service in our school.

In SCHOOL_NAME, the population of litter is huge.

Students here think after using an object and its time to dispose it, it belongs on the ground.

All students at SCHOOL_NAME

should take part and help.

Making our school look better will be a big helping hand.

By that I want to totally help to clean up our school !

I would first make a survey. Post it out in each hallway in the school.

Then I would have every student to sign yes if they think its a good idea to have community service or no.

With the following students that has pick yes I will call a meeting.

Next I would ask them what days are good to stay after school and clean or can they come everyday.

The students that will not take part of this act I would make another community service.

Our school looks horrible especially the break areas.

Also the court yard of the school pavement need to be refill with concrete.

The school walls, classrooms, and hallways need to be repainted.

The graffiti on the hallways wall and outside the school building walls need to be painted over.

I strongly believe us students can do it.

With this all said and done, Principle TEACHER_NAME I have may reasons why you should require school community service. First I believe our school should have community service because it looks trashy not classy.

Second because students think trash belongs on the ground. My third reason is because inside the school building needs repainting.

Most all ,all students should take part in this act to make our school look like a school not a public park !            ",2,Community service,Independent

I think it is a very good thing for all kids our age to do community service. It helps out with pollution and helps keep our town clean.

Some kids like to do it but some kids don't. Most of us think it takes time away from fun activities we do over weekdays and weekends. I highly suggest that we make a sign-up board in the cafeteria for kids who want to work certain hours. I think Wednesday through Saturday is suitable. We can sign up and pick put 5 to 10 people we want to be in our groups. I think groups will help this problem.

I think most kids don't like it because there not working with their own very close friends. I honestly feel that way too. We all want to have fun and enjoy helping out.

Now as far as the helping out with Elementary kids goes, I think we can do the same thing. We can all come up with fun ideas for the kids and do it with them. On summer days we can do fun activities outside and have food and drinks. I think the School board wont mind if we use a tiny bit of money on pizza or chips. If they do I think we could chip in some money. When it is cold and winter we could do activities in the classrooms. We can have movies and hot chocolate. We can also bring board games for the kids.

I strongly believe that community service is something good, and that all the students should be willing to perform community service in some way. Community service teaches us many valuable things.

And it also gives us the opportunity to aid others that need it.

Community service is very important in many ways. First, is a way of helping, and growing together as a community.

Also, we shouldn't expect someone else to do our job. We are the future of our community/country; and if we are growing up expecting we don't have to do anything, we will have very few chances of being successful.

It is definitely not a waste of time.

We can do many things we like for community service.

Like if we like math, or are good at it, we could tutor those who need more help. Or if we are interested in justice, or working for peace, we could volunteer at places that do that kind of work.

Furthermore, community service doesn't have to be boring, we could take our friends, or siblings. Then they will learn from our example, we will have company, and our virtues will spread throughout our community.

Finding ways to perform community service is very easy; just talk to your parents, neighbors, classmates, etc. Something else is that it doesn't have to be the biggest thing ever. Small actions will lead to great achievements.

Doing small actions every day, sometimes without even planning, will help our community grow in many ways.

We will also benefit from these actions. When we need help we will know that our neighbor or classmate will be there to help us and will take care of us. When we are older, the younger kids we showed all those virtues, will keep passing them to their family, friends. Soon we will see all the great things we achieved.

It is a duty that kids should do for example pick up trash at the park or at the beach or help at homeless shelters or soup kitchens. Kids have plenty of energy and time to do community service. Some kids say they don't have the time but really they have time there just to lazy to do it.

I think that in high school students should at least a month of community service to pass to the next grade. It is important that they help out because if they don't the community well become more of a mess then it already is.

2290CEF95268,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students including myself, should NOT be Required to perform Community Service for Three Different Reasons. One reason is because It takes Up time of our everyday life. For Example, Students Will be exhausted and won't have enough energy or time to complete their EVERYDAY Homework If Community Service was Instructed. Teachers, School Employee's, and Parents are always hard on Students about Not completing their Homework or Schoolwork and this here situation will just make that task even worse. Time is being simply taken away from the Students if Community Service was Required and Students won't have any room to do some of their everyday Needs/Wants.

Another Reason Community Service is Not required by students Is because, Its deals with Tutoring Elementary Students, and Cleaning the Community. Don't get me wrong their's Nothing wrong with help other friends/associates out, As a matter of fact that's a good example Of Team Work. All I'm saying Is Tutoring should be done by a Teacher, After all they do get paid for TEACHING. And community service as in cleaning up litter, should be Done by the Citizens of Miami Gardens, Or Prisoners. I've seen Prisoners being watched to clean up the City of Miami Gardens. If these Things were done by School Students their would be no jobs for Teachers or The City Workers which means No money to Supply for Themselves, Kid, and Bills. Its okay for Students to do this but I just Don't think it's a Suitable Idea for Community Service.

Lastly, Community Service should NOT be required for Students to do because, Community Service should be something else instead of Tutoring, or Picking Up Trash. It should be a Meeting, with all The Citizens of Miami Gardens getting together, and Talking about ways they Could Do things better. For Example, Things such as, Not Polluting, Teaching better or to the point when all the Students understand, Should be Discussed At This Meeting. If this was done I Do believe their would be No Point/Need for ""Community Service"".

Students should not be forced to do community service. Children should learn to make the right choices instead of forced onto it. Many children do not have the time to do this much community service. The youth might also not do a very good job at this either. Therefore children should not be forced into community service.

Many children already do community services, because they chose to. You should support this idea but not make it a rule. Extra credit should be given to the students to motivate them. the students need to learn to make the right choices not forced>

some children can not find time in there week to community service>students might even have too much homework to take time for these services>many children are being tutored themselves<and cannot tutor or take any time off to do community work>

I do think that students should perform in community service because it is very important to clean up our school and also to have a very good environment or all the animals in the ocean will die and when we want to go to the Aquarium they will be no more animals to see. Why not you might asked because most of them will be dead or might be surviving a death full time. For Example if the students in out school start to perform community service our school will always be clean and its a great work to show team work and that anything that we try to do it will always accomplished. I also don't think its a waste of time because we never give time to start caring about our environment and start caring and helping about others people health.

See if the more we liter and recycle the more healthier our plant will be and if we don't help then our environment will be very dirty we won't be able to breath our nice natural environment instead will be breathing dirty stuff and we don't want that to happen because then everybody in the plant will die including the animal it's like the end of the world but because we didn't give time to take care of our plant and just decided to do something else less important than our health. However, that's why i think its important to recycle and liter.

Also, because it's a great time to use our teamwork and show our love to everyone and how much we care about there health and also a great way to make new friends and new changes to our school and our plant Hope you make all your students attend in community service.

I think you should make community service mandatory for a few reasons.

First, community service should forced because it make our area a better place to live overall. Picking up litter makes it a cleaner and more enjoyable place to be.

Next community service shouldn't be optional because it builds character. It develops compassion and kindness in people. It helps them realize that the place they live in is important to them and to other people.

Lastly, community service is important because it gets people off their couch and in to the streets helping people. It helps to make kids realize how tough the real world is and how hard it will be when they grow up. And, of course, colleges love kids who do good things for their community, like community service!

I can see why people say that community service isn't necessary. But I think that they say it because they are just lazy. We need to get them out and about teaching children or picking up litter

As you can see, community service is crucial and should be mandatory for all kids in our school. Without community service, the state of our city will deteriorate until it is no more.

B111395C3C6E,"I think it would be bad to have community service. I choose this reason because some kids never have time to do anything and making them do community service would just waist their time to have fun. Plus what if some kids have after school activities and must go to them then they would get in trouble. That would cause a lot of trouble in the school.

If kids just went to community service everyday they would be tired when they got done causing kids to be lazy in the future and end up being overweight. Then they would end up not going to work and jobs wouldn't be getting done. If jobs didn't get done then we wouldn't have any new technology and we would slowly die out of the human race. No one wants that to happen do they?

If kids went to community service then their parents wouldn't really get to spend time with them because the kids would be working after school and they would be too tired when they got done working that they would go straight to sleep when they got home. they wouldn't be able to spend time at them on the weekend because the kids would want to have the time they could to play without having to go to work. Then the parents would be sad because they never have any time with their kids and the family would slowly fall apart. That's another reason why community service is bad.

If the parents would support the principals the children would and/or should want to listen to their parents, and do what their parents think is best for them. I know people think that picking up trash out of the streets is cruel, but actually it's not. It's just showing that you do care about your community.

I'm writing you this letter to inform you on what i think you should do. I know you are trying whether or not if all students should be required to do any community service. Community service is good but not all the students would wan' t you to make it a requirement. So here is my argument on what you should do.

I think that you need to think about the community service. Some of the kids are already doing some community service and they would probably like the help, but what do you think the other kids who don't wan' t to do community service will react to you saying all students now have to do community service. The kids who have to do might try to get their parents to let them drop out of school, because i wouldn't want to do community service.

If you make the kids do community service the community might get into better shape than it already is. You also have to think that kids wouldn't have enough time to get some of their homework finished or be able to go to their after school activities. I think that if you make the kids do it they wouldn't, you would have to punish them for not doing the community service so that would just make the students made at you. The parents are a very hard subject. Some of the parents might like their kids going out and doing some community service instead of being home all of the time, but there are other parents that probably wouldn't like their kids being away from home any longer than being at school.

The teachers at school are also a very big subject. They wouldn't be able to give out as much homework so they would intern have to do more work at school. Doing more work at school would also mean the students would be less happy than they already were knowing that they have to come home just for more community service they had to do. There are some teachers that pretty much just give out homework and that would ruin there whole school year curriculum.

That is my argument about making kids volunteer for community service. Truthfully who wants to do more work than they already have to do. In my opinion school work is very hard without knowing you will have to go home knowing that after working all day at school the students just have to go home and work more.

I think its a great idea for students to help out and join community service, you should require all students to join. Helping the community is very important because there aren't a lot of people who would take the time to help out.

They probably think its a waist of time when its not. Not many people want to stop what there doing or some are just to busy. The community is a lot in need for some support and help, and we should give it to them if they need it.

There are a bungle of things that students can help with, little elementary kids with hard school assignments that parents come home too late to help with.

dirty ponds and lakes that need cleaning up, parks with loads of trash everywhere, buildings with nasty spray paint all over and senior citizens who need help around the house. Also on Halloween there's little kids who need to get around the area without trouble, and not all little kids have older brothers and sisters to take them.

There are animal shelters and so much more they can do for the community.

I have friends in the ninth grade who perform service to the community and it helps them with there high-school diploma. Some just do it because they think its right and a good thing.

I think everyone would agree that community service can get a little annoying. However, doing community service, whether you like it or not, makes everyone a better person. It's always nice to help someone out or make our community a better and nicer place to live in. Community service can be anything from picking up trash that you see lying around to visiting a nursing home just to brighten someone's day. I understand that not everybody has a lot of time on their hands with sports and all different types of activities, but sometimes missing out on things that might be fun to you is worth it in the end. For example, my Mom Mom is a clown. One time I went with her to the nursing home and I can not even tell you how good it felt to see those people smile. With my Mom Mom and I visiting I could just tell how much it meant to them. My Mom Mom would pop one of her corny jokes ... but the patients in the nursing home absolutely LOVED our company. I could tell just by the way they looked at us with a smile from ear to ear that we brightened up their day. I had to miss skating, a sport that i have been doing since I was two years old, to do this community service project, but let me tell you... it is DEFINATELY worthwhile.

The feeling you get when you see these people's faces are priceless. It's amazing how contagious a smile is. You can not get that feeling of accomplishment... or that feeling that you actually made someone's day that much better any other way other than performing community service. Yes, it sounds like a pain. I do not know any other way to say it other than to BELIEVE ME when i say that knowing that you helped our community in a positive way is one of the greatest things ever. The reason why I am writing to you today is to tell you that I truthfully believe that it should be a requirement for every student in our school to complete some sort of community service project. Whether it is walking a marathon to raise money, picking up trash lying around, visiting a nursing home, feeding the poor, donating food or clothes to a charity, or simply just making someone smile, community service is so easy to do and makes our society a much safer and nicer place. With all this being said, please take into consideration that community service does everyone good. Not only does it help our society but it also makes everyone a better person inside and out.

If we have community service we might be the highest state or city that is the cleanest of the fifty states in the year 2011. That would be cool because we could be recognize in the whole world. You could tell people not to be in gangs but in church this would help because we don't have that much people dyeing or killing each other.

Besides helping little kids is really important because your helping them not to litter or to be mean to other little kids. Elementary is the most important place not to litter because little kids just see a candy n the ground and they just pick it up and put it in the mouth. If we see students doing community service the parents might be proud of there child because there helping the community to be more cleaner. If i would do community service i would help people with there yards and if i saw and adult throw a peace of paper i would say kindly can you please pick that up lets try to clean our community please.

In my opinion i would be picking things up than the city or the state would look or smell bad. actually the parents should educate there child since there little and teach them not to litter anywhere.

I send you this letter to let you know about the arguing that has been going on our school whether students should be required to perform community service or not. Well my opinion is that performing community should be an optional, however I think teachers should encourage students to do it. Teachers can encourage students by offering rewards such as extra-credits.

I believe this method would work on students, this way students can do better on school and help their community, all at the same time. If we were to require them, those students that say to not have time would feel as if they were obligated to work for something that does not benefit them. On the other hand if we didn't encourage them, they simply wouldn't do it.

Community service is a great thing to do to help the earth. Some students feel that community service isn't right for them to do and it takes up their leisure time. It would be great to get things done. For example, cleaning up trash can stop pollution and make earth look more organized. Instead of laying around and doing nothing or going out with a couple of friends, you can always pick another day to do that. Once the trash man comes, that trash being picked up is eventually going to get polluted. It would be best to get it and recycle rather than having the worst done to it. In the end, you will be appreciated and it will benefit you in your future.

Tutoring younger children can be benefiting as well. When children grow up to be smart, they might be the ones who make the world better. Having extra help when they needed, showed that someone cared for their future and that can build confidence in what they really want to do in life.. I feel that if we do it now, things will change for the better. Some of us may not see it now but they will in the future. I believe that thinking ahead makes you plans go smoother.

I am writing to you on behalf of your decision on requiring community service for all students. I think community service is a great experience for all people. Although, I don't think it should be required. When something is required to do something it feels like somewhat of a chore. Also, when you are doing community service you are doing it to help people or the environment not just to build up a grade in class. You simply can not make some one do community service. There are ways for you to get more people into doing community without forcing them. For example, a lot of people want to help the community but they have a hard time finding services to work on. So what you can do is set up a bulletin board up in the school that displays all of the possible opportunities. I would also advise you not to reward the students who do community service because, again community service is not about rewards but, giving out to the community.

This school should have the children here do community service. They should be required to learn good social skills and manners. Children nowadays are very lazy and rude to elders and people on a daily basis. The community is suffering their horrible acts to it. We need to teach them how to perform community service to save them from their community belittling.

Community service is very important. The community you live in tells who you are. Most people make their homes look nicer and the area around it to make sure nobody gets the wrong first impression about them. This should be taken into consideration. Many communities are not well kept and not nice to look at. The school's property looks horrible because of the way these kids treat it. Community service should be expected from children in this school and they should do it twice in a school year.

Manners and social skills are important to have and these kids don't. Because of this when they get a job they will be rude to their boss and the people around them whether their in a bad mood or not. If the person is trying to give a compliment and they say it the wrong way the person will be embarrassed. Without social skills they won't know how to talk to a person or know how to handle a bad situation. If you have realized ,the kids who do community service have good social skills and manners and they use they everyday!

Since the certain kids that don't do community service are lazy and don't want to do anything or get up to throw something in the trash where it belongs they throw it onto the ground and leave it there for someone else to pick it up. That is called littering. And it is illegal in some states. They could get in trouble and go to jail or get a fine. This would cause them to become behind on school work or not get into college for a little thing like littering.

All schools should have the kids do community service. If our school does it we would be setting a good example for ourselves and the kids who go to this school. That will help them get into college and get a good job. Simple things t]like manners and good social skills are very useful and are part of the bargain with community service. The kids here would be a lot nicer and put more effort into their work. Teaching these students how to perform community service would make this town and school a better place.",4,Community service,Independent

I would like to say that having students perform community service would not be right if they have plans. I think that these students should have the rights to decide on if they want to do it as a after school thing because some students would be busy with plans they want or need to do. Some students might not even do the community service and skip it. So it would be a better idea if you have them choose if the wanted to take there time of day and do community service.

Some of the students might not think of community service as very important and slack on there job on helping the community. If you have them work with elementary school children , they might not even help them or they might give the child the wrong answer just because they have to be stuck there working with that child and not be some where else. I don't think that would be a good idea to have them do that. Some students who would have to work with the litter might even litter them self or not even pick the trash up and hang out with his/her friends. Then there wouldn't be no work done and there would be a bigger mess to clean.

Even if you think about punishing these students for not doing there work, they wont care because they don't want to be there at all. If you make them do extra they just mess it up more. So would you like for the elementary school children to fail because you sent students to help them when they didn't want to at all? Would you want the parents of the elementary school children to be mad about what your students or teaching them? Do you want the parks or fields where these students have to pick up litter be even more a mess? Do you want these kids to make your community an undesirable place to be?

I think that students should have to perform community service hours. There are so many problems and sad nesses in this world that with even just a little help could be better. For example recycling, many people throw away plastic bottles everyday. This builds up and destroys our beautiful environment. With students help we could help inspire people to recycle and give out recycling bins to people around the community. We also have many tragedies everyday that put people at a loss. For example tornadoes destroying peoples homes. With students help we can rebuild new homes and even wash clothes for those who don't have them. While doing this students would not only giving the people a good home and making them happy ,but making the world a better place and setting a good example for others to help out. We already have wonderful volunteering businesses in the United States today that many students could help improve. So as you can see there are so many ways that students can make a big impact on the whole world. Kids could even just help by going from door to door in their neighborhood selling things such as magazines to raise money for charities. For all the wonderful things we have on earth it's really not to much to ask of someone to help out. Thank you for considering my thoughts.

I think its unfair to mandate community service. Some people think its a great i idea to do community service, but for some people it just takes to much time!

If we had more time on our hand then i would be all for community service, but don't have a lot of time to do anything after school. Our teachers give us too much home work and not enough time to do it all and now if it becomes mandatory to do community service no one will have any time to do anything but homework and community service. That is unfair and unjust taking a way our personal time. Before the only time i had to myself was sleeping, and now i will have to spend that picking up trash. Or reading to the blind. Or tutor elementary school students. Or spending my time with old people that have Alzheimer's disease, who can even remember the last time they went to the bath room. That is a court sentence, not what you do for school.

I understand that what your considering doing is for a good cause. But leave community service to people who want to do it and can do it. Not to people that are being forced to.

I do think community service is important for students to get involved in. Not only is it good for the community, but it is good for us to do things for ourselves and for others. Some of the reasons why I think community service is a good thing is because it is a great way to students to get involved in their community, it is a great thing for the environment, and it is a great thing for others, too.

The first reason why I think community service is a good thing is because it is a great way for students to get involved in their community. Kids these days have a bunch of new technology and they think they can just live off of that and that nothing else matters in the world except beating their high score at the newest video game. Well I have news for them. There are more important things to do than play video games all day. They can join clubs or just help people out. They can join a group that supports local charities or they can join together to help clean up the community. It doesn't have to be boring and you can do it with friends. You get to hang out with your friends while you help others, and I think that's the most important thing of all. We should start getting people involved with more community service.

The second thing why I think community service is a great thing is it's great for the environment. If you just throw your trash everywhere, it builds up higher and higher over time and now you have a dirty community and nobody wants that. And plus, littering is illegal and you can get a high- priced fine for doing it, so it's better to pick up the trash, rather than cause it. You can join your local YMCA or other clubs and go around and pick up a few pieces of trash because if 10 people each pick up 5 pieces of trash, that's already 50 pieces of trash! If you go out and do it even just once a week, you will have a better and a cleaner community in no time, and a cleaner community is always better for everyone.

The last reason why community service is a good idea and should be enforced is that it is a great thing to do for others too, not just yourself. Some people want to help out with jobs around their community but maybe they are elderly or they are sick or injured and they can't . This is where kids come in. They are in the best health of their lives right now so they can go out and help clean up around their elderly or sick neighbors house and I am sure that would just make their day because they aren't able to do it themselves. Plus, doing things for others doesn't just make them feel good, it makes you feel good because you know you have done a big deed for that person and it makes them really happy.

Now you see which side and take and why I think helping out in your community is such a good idea. It gets people involved in their communities and neighborhoods, it's a great thing to do for the environment, and it's a great thing to do for others who maybe can't do community service themselves. I think community service should be encouraged to kids and students of all ages because it is a great thing to do.

B93AA2C15E8B,"dear TEACHER_NAME, i don't think that all people should do community service because i think that if all students do this it is a waste of time because when were in school were either learning something or we are doing an elective and we don't need to do community service cause that's other peoples jobs like court ordered. i also think that community service would be a waste of time because there's not that much trash on our campus and making us go off campus to pick up someone's trash is for sure a waste of time where we could be doing something else cause that would be better than picking up trash for an hour.

i wont deny that it would be good but its just that its kind of boring to pick up trash, sure its good for everything and everyone but i think that's just somebody else's job to worry about. i don't think that this could happen though because if it did how would you make it happen? if you did it would most likely have to be a before school or after school thing but who on earth would join some club that says ""the picking up trash club"" i don't think anyone would join that club because who wants to pick up trash all day? not me.

there's also another reason why we shouldn't do this, because there's a person in charge of picking up trash in schools and that's the janitors, I'm not being mean or anything but its true and the person that's in charge of picking up trash out side is the garbage people. if this did happen which its unlikely because of so many classes during the day that i don't think that this could possibly happen because its just unlikely. there are thousands of reasons that there shouldn't be a community service at our school because its a waste of time and there are millions of reasons why we shouldn't but that doesn't mean its a bad thing.

I think that all students should be required to do some community service. We all have to live in this town together so why don't we all take part in keeping it clean and a nice place to live. Community service is not just to keep things clean, but it is also to help people live a better and healthier life.

Some people don't think community service is worth the time, but those people have never taken the time to try it. They don't know the satisfaction you get when you see the smile on a person's face for doing the right thing. People always thank you and most of all you know inside that you did the right thing and that fills an emptiness inside.

Sometimes community service can be fun. If you happen to do something that you are interested in. Like maybe if you're into sports you could clean up your local sports complex. And create a better more fun facility for everyone.

Everyone that i know that has done any community service say they like it. They don't mind taking the time to do something good for someone else. Doing community service is also for your benefit, by keeping you up and active. It gives you something to do, rather than sitting at home on the coach being lazy eating potato chips and playing video games.

So I think that it would be a good idea for you to have everyone do some kind of service to help the community. So please take this letter into consideration. Thank you for your time and i hope this letter helps your decision.

I have been informed that there is a school issue regarding whether students should be required to perform community service. Students should be required to perform community service. I think it would really say something about our school and SCHOOL_NAME would take a leader role in the community. The students should be out helping the community rather than sitting on the couch eating potato chips. In just one hour, there can be a lot of beneficial improvements towards the community. This service can also count towards kids National Junior Honor Society and service hours for Conformation or Bar/Bat Mitzvah's. Service hours can show a lot about someone's character and I think if all students were required to do this, everyone's character would build and get better. The community as a whole would become much better. Students can learn from helping out the community and might find a passion for a particular service. Others will realize that all these students are really trying to make a nicer community and then the other's will feel obligated to help out too. It takes a special person to really be dedicated to community service. The students will learn more about themselves and what they can do that will really help out society. If students start making positive attributes to the community you might see less crimes going around. This will also lead to students making better decisions and seeing themselves as a different person. Students will be honored by their community and should realize how much you put into to your community is how much your community will give back.

B6C0D82C6F85,"To the principal:

I believe that all students should not be required to perform in community service. Some of the students just have too much on there plate already, then throw in something else, it will cause much drama that the school does not need. Even though community service is a great way to help out and fix things in your community it will just take up way to much time your students lives. The downside to not having every student involved in community is that colleges look at the student and their extra activities they are involved in outside of school. I know that would help some students that are going to college on a academic and sports scholarship but yet again it would have seen a waste to some of the students that are planning on not attending college. This year if i would have been forced to do community service it would have been a hassle for me since i play football and i am in double advance classes that takes up most of our evenings and sometimes even our weekends. Overall community service should not be required to all students maybe the ones who do not have anything to do after school or on the weekends that would be great but those who play a sport or are in a group, club or something like that it would not suit them well. All though community service is a very debated topic around the schools in our nation. It is as big as the board of education. So in the next few years we might see a law passed from the president concerning community service involvement in schools.",3,Community service,Independent

As you walk down the street you see trash, bottles and cups. Think how nice it would be if all of the students at our school had to do community service. I think community service should be required at our school. This would help everyone in the community. It would clean our parks and roads, help students and would teach students it isn't good to be lazy. I think it would be very smart to require students to do community service.

A normal day for a student is to come home from school and play video games. You could change that and have the students do something productive like cleaning roads and parks or helping fellow students by tutoring them. This wouldn't only help the students who are getting tutored or the parks and roads it would help the tutors and the cleaners they would be helping others by doing a very simple task.

If you didn't require this the students would become lazier than they all ready are and would sit and play video games all day!

On the contrary the students would be outside with their friends getting fresh air. This would help them stay in shape.

I know many students wouldn't like this but, if you made them work for 1 hour after school once a week or, 4 hours a month it would really contribute to citizens of our town and city. Think about how many people would love to walk and jog on the paths of our clean parks

I think requiring community service would assist everyone. Please consider this reasonable and fruitful idea.

I say yes that kids should have to do some community service. I think this because most kids these days are lazy and don't ever go out side to work, it will give them an advantage at what work will look like when there older, and they will also be able to see what kind of job fits them.

Most kid these days are usually inside playing xbox, play station or sitting on there couch eating crap like chips. I have a neighbor who never goes outside he's always inside playing video games or watching tv. When kids do this they aren't getting anywhere in there life. When they go to get there first job the people will ask them if they have any experience and they will say no and then they will never get a job. See and their life is just going to rot away. This is the first reason why kids should do community service.

Next they will have a look on what jobs are going to be like. Like if there are hard, to easy, to much, not enough. I work a lot with my dad he has a landscaping business and i have two horse that I have to take care of and work. I think landscaping would be to hard for me but i like to help out so i go and learn new things all most every time. And with my horses they are a lot of work they have me running around getting stuff that i need for them all the time like hay grain treats. So getting kids out on a job will show them what the real world is like and how scary and hard it can be.

Finally kids will be able to see what job fits them the most. Like a physically working job or sitting in a chair all day answering phone calls. I like being outside the most so i would like not to be in a chair all day just like school. I know some kids who have know clue what they want to be because they don't get showen enough what jobs are like in real life. If you are a video game freak when you do community service why don't you help little kids out playing them or something.

Ask you can see that doing community service as a kid, will give you a lot of benefits and more choices as what you would want to do when you are older.

Again it will help the lazy kids that do nothing all day, give kids advantages, and finally see what kind of job they will be good at. Get off your couch and help out the community now!",4,Community service,Independent
D8D90E042134,"In my personal opinion, I think that students should decide on their own. I mean if they're eight-graders, they should be smart enough and decide on their own on what they want, or don't want to do. For me, I would choose helping the community, 'cause if you think about it, your actually doing it for your own goods, maybe in some points your not, but most of them from peoples personal experiment's basically, your doing it for your community and your country, the world and people that are around you. What i would do, I would make a list from easiest, to hardest on helping the community, and start from the easiest because at first, your not used to it, and you need to learn how to be responsible for your things, and for what you do. For example, I'll pick, helping students in your classrooms. Then, I might start tutoring my cousins or neighbors, something to start of with, like a practice. If I'll see or think that I'm good enough, I might move on, tutoring Elementary kids. Later on, I'll be a famous tutor! If I'll be doing a good job at tutoring, I might starting subbing for teachers, then they'll ask me to be a teacher! Which means, that now I'll have a job! So basically, I made my own personal carrier just for helping the community! What I'm trying to say, helping you community isn't as bad. If your one of the lucky ones, you'll make your self a carrier, if not, keep on trying!

I personally think that you should give every kid community service. Giving kids community service really helps kids get out of trouble ,help our community and teach kids that helping the community can really help set a good example for the next generation to come.

First, I feel that you should give kids community service to make sure they stay out of trouble. Kids that go hang with friends usually are up to no good. Community service can give them a reason to stay out of trouble. It can really change a kid and teach them about the importance of keeping to community nice and safe

Also, community service can help teach kids to be more respectful to our communities. this can also set a good example for younger kids so that by lending a hand they can really change the environment to a healthy community.

I believe that the students should have a choice whether or not to do community service.

Yes, it would be better if everyone helped out in some way, but we shouldn't have it mandatory. Those who disagree with community service should have a choice, because they wouldn't give 100% in everything that they do, and we would expect that from them. You also want all the students to enjoy helping the community. If they don't have fun with it, then why would they want to do it?

If they like doing it, they will keep doing it.

But, one way to get others who do not want do community service is to have them help out with areas in their interest. Such as, if a cheerleader didn't want to do community service, offer her to help out with younger cheerleaders. She would probably be interested, and there would be a high chance that she would do it. Otherwise, if you offer that type of community service to a football player, there is a low chance he would do it.

Whether it be tutoring, babysitting, or picking up trash, if anyone feels the need to do good, they will. If not, someone else will.

We should not have to do any community service. I think this because kids have other things that they need to worry about. For example, teachers give kids a ton of homework everyday. To be able to do that homework, we need time. Community Service would take away that time to do homework and study for tests.

Another reason why we shouldn't have to do community service is because of extra curricular activities. Kids play all types of sports. They have them on the weekends and on the week days. They also have to fit in the homework factor. There is not enough time in the day to fit in school, homework, extra curricular activities, and community service. We could do it if we would want to, but we should not have to. Many kids don't have the time to fit in all of their extra curricular activities and homework, let alone anything else.

We also have many chores to do at home. This also takes time away to do homework, extra curricular activities, and other things kids might do. Depending on the chore depends on how much time it takes to that particular chore.

Community Service would also take time away from being with friends. Socializing is a big part of teenage lives.

They need to be social. They also have to be active. If they don't already participate in a sport, they might be in a club so they cannot take the time to do any Community Service.

All in all, I do not think that we should have to do community service because it takes up too much time.

This is a good punishment because they will probably hate it and their doing something good for the community. I think the number of hours of community service should be based on what they did and how bad it was.

I believe that students should be performing community service because it would really help the environment. It does not matter if they are picking up the litter or tutoring others, as long as they are trying to help the environment.

My first reason why students should perform community service is because it would help the environment. Then if other people see the students doing community service they might want to help too. Now wouldn't that be terrific? Just seeing others help out makes me want to do more for the environment.

My next reason on why students should perform community service is because it can save lives. For example, the amount of garbage we throw out every day adds up very fast. Soon the whole world will be filled with garbage and we will not have any place to put it. Then people could get very sick from just breathing in the fumes. I really hope that you take this into consideration.

My third and final reason on why students should perform community service is because it gives them something to do. Kids often go home and just sit on the couch and watch television. If you consider having a student community service program I know for a fact that I wouldn't just go home and be lazy, I would get all geared up and go out to find someplace that might need a little more cleaning up to do.

i think that students should have to perform at least two hours of community service. i think that they can spare at least two hours and if they cant spare two hours one hour will be fine to help people that need help. if they needed that help then they would want someone to help them. it doesn't even have to be a hard job it can be picking up litter in you community or helping out kids that need a little extra help in school, or maybe helping out at the senior center or if you like animals then you can volunteer at the animal shelter because they need a lot of help and you will be helping the animals at the same time who knows maybe they will even like it a lot and volunteer there full time. if i had to give up two hours of my day to help someone then i would because i might like it i think that if we do, do community service then we should get something in return not something big but something. it would be a great change in the school. i think that if you made every kid in the school do community service that a lot of people would sign up and volunteer. plus if you get all your friends to do it then you and your friends can be spending time together but still helping out other people and having fun all at the same time. i think that everyone should try it because some people enjoy helping others and for the people that don't have the time i think that if they try this program then they will start to like it and they would have never known. you should try it and see what happens i bet you a lot of people would sign up. and who knows maybe you will too. thank you for reading this letter.",3,Community service,Independent

First, community service gives students a chance to give back and show they appreciate everything that they have to live for. For example I help the special education class I don't ask for anything in return. It makes me feel good to know that I made someone smile I caused them joy. It also made me realized what I have and to be grateful for it. It could be a real eye opener for some kids. this again is just my opinion.

Last, doing community service also looks good on college and work resumes. It shows your involved and a good leader. Also just shows your a good person and that's what people look for. That's the kind of person that people want to know, want in their colleges, and that's who they want to work for them.

So push students into community service because it helps in the long run and isn't your job to help better students and give them the foundation to a better future. So what are you waiting for make sure your students succeed in life. Keep them off the streets and doing something good.",3,Community service,Independent

It is a fact that most students would rather spend their time at home or out with friends, but I think that it is a great idea for students to get involved in community service. It builds character and allows students to get involved within the community. Doing community service reveals opportunities for students when they are older, it lets them see the realities of the real world, and it also puts a smile on other peoples' faces. Community service is a need for the community.

Those students who don't do community service never get to see their likes and dislikes in jobs, so it may be harder for them to find a profession in college. When students spend time doing community service, it reveals jobs a student may want to do once out of school. For example, if one likes to work in a nursing home, it doesn't mean that one is going to get a job in a nursing home, it shows that one likes to take care of people and that means that person would be good as a doctor, nurse, or anything involving people in need. When people pick up litter, it does not mean that those people are going to be garbage men or something of that nature, it shows that they care for the environment and wildlife, and may consider going into a field that involves them. By doing these things, it also gets students out of the house.

Being shown to the real world is important for any young person. Reason being that if they aren't, they will not be prepared and probably will have no idea how to deal with it other than running back to their parents for help. When having to actually have a job and work to get what one wants could be a problem for some. Doing community service could change that. Volunteering at a concession stand at the local sports fields and having to get what the customer orders, or working at a nursery and seeing that one has to take care of something and, also, having the urgency to take care of their needs could be an eye opener for some. That is where community service may be essential.

If those reasons are not good enough then i think that the most important part is that community service makes everybody's day better. For being the person who is doing the community service to the people that get to watch, people get to see that they care and that the future is in good hands since students are the future leaders, doctors, and all of those important jobs. Community service builds character and teaches life lessons without students even realizing it. Community service makes better people.

Community service is what students need to do. It should be required but not be a bad thing or another project. It should be something that people enjoy doing especially if you do it with friends. I hope that i have made it clear that community service is the way to go.

I understand that too many students, the argument of whether community service is a waste of time, or actually worth the while is much to debate. Whether or not we should be helping to plant the public gardens, or if watering those tulips is just a waste of time that could be spent doing other things. Well, I'm here too say that community service truly is important, and should definitely be required. It helps students of all ages, by getting into our community, by helping it out, and helping others out too.

One reason it should be required, is how much it helps our community! Now, I'm sure you know about the basics, like, how cleaning up litter makes a much more enjoyable walk, or how tutoring students helps them understand more. Well, how about doing things like, helping the new library open up? Wouldn't that help students understand the communities needs, help them too become more involved with the whole reading scene of the community, and hey, it might even help them too use their creative skills too get other's in there too.

Another reason community service is such an important part of the community, is of course, how it helps the community! Have you ever taken a walk in the park, and ooked around at all the trash laying everywhere, and just thought to yourself of how nice it would be without all that? Well, cleaning that up is a part of community service, so wouldn't it be great too have the students do that too make it much more enjoyable? It also gets them out there a little more.

Last, of the multiple reasons, is how it helps others. One other's see the students taking their part in helping the community, they'll want too also! Together we can make a much more enjoyable community, starting with the students.

So, out of all these reason, and more of course, why not have them in community service? It's great for everyone! Whether it be the community, other students, or skills,      ",3,Community service,Independent

I wouldn't want to do it community service sounds boring and a waste of my time. People that love Earth day and people who actually care about the world and want to waste their times cause they have no life they would want to do that. To me that sounds unfair for the principal to do that to us cause forcing us to do it is like going to court and the judge telling us that we have to do 40 hours of community service. If the principal does make us do that i will have a petition and a protest against it i will be standing up for the people that don't want to do community service. Well That's my opinion i hope you make the right decision thank you for listening. :)

91B15D1BDD98,"Dear Dr. Principal,

In my years here, I've noticed that a considerable amount of my friends have started community service, and our town is benefiting from it. The local are is a lot cleaner, and my little brother, who's class had a few tutors from our school, told me that everyone's grades were going up.

I recently heard that you want to require all students to complete acts of community service, and I think it's a great idea. If these few people are making this big of a difference, think how much our entire school could do!! I believe that with the student body helping the entire community could drastically change the healthiness of our lives. Plus, if all the elementary students who needed help had tutors, there grades could shoot up, and therefore, we'd have less failures to deal with.

While some students may not like this idea, mainly because they don't care, I, along with many others, think your idea is great, and could benefit the entire town. If you think about it, a better environment makes for better people.

I do not think that all students should be required to participate in community service. I think the students should be free to choose whether they want to help out their community or not. Even though I would recommend doing it, I disagree with the idea of making the students help out.

I know community service is a good thing, and everyone should participate in it, forcing them to do it takes away the fun, contrary to working on your own time with your friends and/or family. Also many of the students who would enjoy being required to do community service are already doing some on their own, while others who don't, probably would work very little while doing with the school.

I, for example, do community service with the scouting program, and sometimes with my family, while my friend, who isn't in the scouting program, doesn't do much service at all, and requiring him to do the service would just be more work for everyone. Plus my friend, and many others, would have a miserable time, while helping out very little.

If you require students to perform community server they are probably going to get stuck with a job they like worse than others, say one kid wants to tutor a student, and another wants to go help out at the soup kitchen, if you require the whole school to go pick up litter around town neither of the students would have a good time. The other students might have gone to do the things they wanted, had a fun time, and probably would have done a better job with that way of helping out.

Students may have something else important they should be doing, but instead they are forced to do community service. For example, a student may have an important sports game, like the finals in a tournament, but if they have to miss it to perform community service with the school their team could lose, and then they would be disappointed in their teammate

So even though helping out the community is something I recommend doing, it isn't right to require it and make many students uncomfortable.",4,Community service,Independent
1.67E+46,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think students should have the option of choosing to do community service because community service is something that will benefit everyone.

If the student chooses to do community service, they will do a better job than if the student is forced.

I think the best thing to do instead of forcing students to choose community service, is to have a program that stresses the importance of getting involved with community service to get students interested.

It may inspire students to do community work and if it doesn't, they still saw how much it counts in our life.

Another way of getting kids involved without being required to is to explain all the different projects that can be done in their community and maybe take some of the interested ones with on the next project to see if they do like it.

If they don't, at least they tried and you may have found some other kids who would like to help.

Students will do a better and more satisfying job of the work they do if they do it on their own terms, whereas kids who are made to will probably not do their best and do their work sloppily.

They may still think it is taking away too much time and may not be responsible about their duties when doing community work.

Community service will be something everyone benefits from and will leave people more satisfied when it is done by people willing to work to make their community a better place than if it is done by someone who thinks it's unimportant and is not doing their best because of that belief.

Thank you for listening to my opinion on the subject and I hope you will take what I said into consideration.

I think you should require students to do at least an hour a week on community service because the community always needs help and who would be better to help than us students. There are always going to be people that don't want to help because they think it is a waste of time but if we don't volunteer now we are just going to be more negative about helping those in need. I think we should help the community because it is a great way to get active and help those in need. Even if donating old clothes helps it should be considered community service because it is technically helping those in need.

Another reason why we should have community service is because it promotes self-confidence and a sense of respect towards those who already help and give to the community. That is good because if you have self-confidence then it can promote you to do other good things without being told to do so (like homework). I think community service can help those in need while helping those that help the community to be better people.

We can create a list of charity events and food drives and have other people add on to that list and have kids sign up to work charity events on the school campus. To make helping out more appealing to some students we could have monthly drawings for students that did two or more hours a week to win some sort of prize. To make sure that people are doing their service we could also have reference sheets that the kids would have to fill out about what they did and have it signed by the person they worked with.

I think that requiring community service would be a great idea for students because of all the benefits to our community from picking up trash or donating clothes to starting food drives and having carnivals for children with cancer or other diseases. Our community can benefit in any way and I think this is the way to trigger the charitable acts in the students here. We have the power to help the community so will you choose to make us help or not?

Students should be required to perform community service because its helps them realize what the real world is like. Also because some kids just think about themselves so if they go out and help someone less fortunate as them then they will take a whole new look on the world.

To begin with if kids do community service it will help them realize what the world is really like. For example last year I had no plan to get a job or go to college because i had no sense of what the real world is like. but then i was involved in a little program that our school does called kids in the community and we went and did all kinds of community service, but the one memory that sticks in my mind is when we went to the soup kitchen. I was talking to some of the people in there and there plans as a little kid were just like mine.

It made me realize that I don't want end up like them without a home, family, and friends I want to live in a great big home and have a great big family.

secondly it will give the students a whole new look on the world. i know that my experience will never leave me and i will never go back to my old ways of thinking. I remember that in the seventh grade all I thought about was myself, but now all i think about is helping others and seeing what I could do for my teachers.

to sum this whole letter up i know that you will make the right decision and require the students to do at least a few hours of community service because it changed my life and i know it will change the life of a few others.      ",3,Community service,Independent

I think that all students should be active in the community and do community service.

I think they should because it helps you be active in the real world.

Also because it makes you active around others and helps people problem solve.

People who think the community doesn't help them is ridiculous if you didn't have a community then you wouldn't be playing sports or going to your community pool.

Also you see a lot of famous people saying "" I want to give back to my community"". They say that because their community does so much for them like encourage them and help the reach their dreams.

I wonder what kids think of when they say the community takes time from what I need or want to do.

What do the mean, if it wasn't for the community the wouldn't be doing anything.

Another reason why kids should do community service is because they are the future face of America so they need to help this country instead of sitting playing video games.

They also learn important life skills like leadership and responsibility.

If you help the community then you will lean these skills very easily.

Once kids start doing this then they will be glad they do it and be happy and feel great and also accomplished.

Kids don't know that the community really needs us and everyone needs to lend a hand or our country wont have good effective leaders in the future.

Also it is not just for out countries leaders it is just for regular people in the work fore need to help because every person makes a big difference.

The community is like a miniature world if people don't keep helping and do9iing work the it will be in a big slump just like the world can be in sometimes.

So I hope you take this letter in to consideration and please listen to my advice. Make the best decision possible and choose what you think is best.

People really need to help the community or it will not keep doing what is has been doing for decades now.

Think about how would you feel if the community you grew up in turned into nothing and everything was gone.

I don't want that to happen to mine.

So please make community service mandatory for everyone.

I heard about the decision that your thinking of making community service a requirement for all students. Now some of my friends were complaining but I honestly couldn't agree more with the idea. What could be so bad about simple community service? All you do is spend a couple of hours doing something that can benefit you in the near future. For one thing, my cousin is now in high school and she needs credit to graduate. Community service will help her complete her hours faster. Another thing is that sometimes you learn from the experience. And all together you have something to do so you don't somehow end up in trouble. Let me show you what I mean.

First and most importantly, for high school your going to need credit in order for you to graduate by senior year. That's where community service comes in handy. You can pick a job like maybe volunteering at the Senior Citizens shelter everyday after school for a few ours. My sister RELATIVE_NAME has been doing this since her freshman year in high school and is now a sophomore and already half of her credits are complete.

Now my moms friends daughter on the other hand is in her first year of high school. She started her credits earlier on in middle school because she wanted to become a nurse. She went to the hospital every Saturday for community service and helped take care of the patients. She would come home everyday telling her family about this and that and how she learned how to talk to her patients and make them feel at ease. In the long run you get a learning experience out of it and now she is sure she definitely wants to become a nurse.

Further more, if every student is required to do community service then it could help students stay out of trouble. After school you could be doing something useful with your time instead of doing wrong, like selling drugs or fighting. If you are required to do community service, chances are the kids will spend more time doing just that and less time laying around and looking for trouble because they'll be too busy to think about anything other then that. Other wise they don't pass high school.

Okay so its obvious I'm on your side with this and I'm sure you'll make the right decision. Those are only a few reasons why I think this should be an enforced rule and there are plenty more. I justified myself long enough and I hope I made my point clear. I'll let you get back to your job and I hope you make the right decision. Community service should be required because it helps you finish needed credits, you learns from the experience and it'll help you stay focused on your future and NOT

Some of my friends are participating in community service and some are not. I decided to write you a letter on whether they should or whether they should not. I think that we should because it's kind and it will probably get into good news when we go to college. If we didn't have community helpers I think that the community would turn bad and look disgusting and if were to get like that who would ever want to live there?

Community service is not a punishment it should be thought as way to help nature and the community. Community service should take place in everyone's lives at some point and what better way is there if we just start at a young age. Community service also matures people and make them choose the right direction in life, that's why when a teen gets into trouble and has to go to court the judge usually send them to do community service for however many hours, and sometimes the teens come out totally different because they see how they can do better things than get into trouble.

Community service has a lot of activities that we can do. And with all the different choices for everyone it shouldn't be that hard to choose one. Principal what I am trying to say is that Community service not only helps the community it helps us too, and i think that we all should participate in it. For example my friend works at the humane center because she love animals, and she does this all in her spare time. Her mom told me when she is done with her homework she goes straight to the humane center, she really enjoys it there. She is not like the typical teenager you see now, she doesn't hang out at the mall, she doesn't go to her friends house after school, and that's all because she found a community service that she loves.

Well that's all i really have to say about my opinion, hopefully I see change in the status quo. Thank you so much.

no way

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I disagree with your decision. I think students should not be allowed to do community service because it takes too much time away from us. We get a lot of homework everyday, which takes half of our time away, and almost every week we have two or three tests. We have to study, do homework, and do house chores, which takes the whole time away from us, and now you want us to do community service! We wont have any time to play and we will have to work all the time. I know that community service will benefit us in the future like in high-school, and I also know that studying is important, but not all the time. If we don't play we will look like school zombies, that always studies. That basically wont be considered life, and what life of a child is. I know and I can understand that community service is very important, but children have a busy life. Students always have to focus on studying, and reach up to their parents hope. For example, my parents want me to get 98 or 99% average, and I study day and night to make my parents proud of me, and i actually do get that high percentages, but if i start doing community service my grades will drop because i wont have enough time to study. Community service and studying is not amusing, but they both benefit us. There are many things that are expected from kids, like community service, but the problem is the amount of pressure these days on a student to A' s that test. If we don't get that much homework and tests, then i am ready to do community service. I really hope you can understand our problems, that we don't have a problem performing community service, even if we have to tutor elementary school children or clean up litter. The main problem is the pressure of getting good grades. Sorry, if your disappointed.

From my stance, I think that students shouldn't be required to perform community service. Sure, some students may want to, so they can if they would like. Other students may find that they do not want to, or do not have the time to.

If every student was assigned to do hours of community service, some may not be satisfied with this. For instance, all of the homework and projects that students are assigned is enough on their plate already after going to school for 6 hours. Some students may have practice, or possibly a game, to go to. Others may have a part-time job working somewhere, and would need the time when they get home to relax and finish up their homework. Every student has a busy schedule outside of school, and may not be able to fulfill their hours of community service.

Other students may not want to do community service. I mean, you shouldn't blame them; they are just kids. They need to have some freedom outside of school. Most students, in general, would be glad to get home from school, maybe take a nap, or go on the computer. Adding homework plus community service after school would just be very stressful to them. In order to function well during the day, students will need all of the sleep they can get. Nowadays, students are not able to get the minimum amount of sleep.

You may be coming to the idea that it is the students' fault for not being able to have time after school, and maybe in some cases it is. But that is how they are living their lives; it's their lifestyle. If they continue living like that, it is because it's how they mange their day. You can't just take away their joy, change how they live, and give them more duties; it would just make them even more stressed. As I had said before, they're only children. They cannot handle so much work and not enough freedom.

In other cases, some students may want to participate in giving community service. Those students possibly have more time on their hands, so doing something for the community is a good way to spend it.

Maybe a better solution would be to set up a club or organization for community service. Let those kids have the option open to them. Rewarding the students in the organization for their efforts would be an easier way to go so everyone is satisfied.

If you are not contented with the idea above, then you could ask some students to give their services on weekends. They have more time then, since it is a break off from school. Community service on weekends can possibly mean that more students would be able to participate, and the community would also be benefited.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my letter. I hope that some of the information in here has guided you into a direction of proclaiming your decision. If you do not go with any of the ideas I have suggested, I hope that you have found some useful information that I have provided throughout my letter.

I don't believe that all students should be forced to do community service.

It's a great thing to do for our community, but not everyone should be forced to do it.

To begin children would resent having to do it.

They wouldn't try their hardest to help the environment.

They would just be being forced to do it, so most people would hate it and either try to get out of it, or just hardly do anything.

The whole point of community service is to help out your community however, if you just have a bunch of kids there that would much rather be at home or with their friends than that defeats the purpose.

Instead of having a lot of unwilling kids doing community service it would be much more effective to have a handful of students that really are willing and interested in helping out in their community.

Although it's sad that not all kids want to help out, their still are a good amount that would be interested.

All people are different, whether it's in appearance or personality.

They completely are different.

Some kids would rather spend their time at home playing video games all day and others would rather help out in the community.

It's nice to think that all children would like to help out with everything but it's just not realistic.

All of humanity is different, if you forced someone who loves say art to be a fireman or woman they most likely wouldn't enjoy it.

Kids want to do things that they really enjoy and if community service isn't it than they won't apply themselves.

Another very important reason, is that students are already so extremely busy.

If you put on another thing to do they will get stretched to thin and not be able to keep up with other things that they have to do.

As students get older they get more and more homework and projects that they really need to focus on.

Not only that, is the fact that after school many people do various sports, arts, etc. that require a lot of their time.

At our age we're trying to figure out what we want to do with our lives and though community service is a great opportunity and just an excellent thing to do, it's not always on people's list of priorities.

With already so much work and activities to do, adding another thing to our plate could destroy our chances of finding something we love to do.

Also a lot of student are already doing a lot of community service.

People in SCHOOL_NAME a scholarship program at school have to do a certain number of community service hours.

And also tons of students that go to church have to.

Anyone in SCHOOL_NAME (which is most middle school students) have to fulfill a number of hours to reach a conformation.

It wouldn't be fair to add more to these kids and then others don't have to do as much.

Maybe a good idea, is to have the student council organize different ways of letting people know how important community service is.

Or even giving people that accomplish a certain number of community service hours rewards.

Doing this will make more kids that want to do community service come out and do it, instead of making people do it when they don't want to.

Students will have more fun if they have the time and want to.

It will have a much better outcome then forcing students.

Many student around the world will always go out side and clean up if they have stuff to do they just wait and do it later they will rather clean up. If you want to live in a clean invirment then you will support me with this problem that I want to fix.

Like there are some places where they don't care how it looks around them and it doesn't look really good. If we could fix this by just say it to go away it would be cool but we cant we have to do something about it. And the solution is to get a group from every student from every school and clean up the nasty thing from the world. And if the student in the school have to do any thing they can wait and get done another time in the time when they finish the work they had to do. So support me and we will fix the world and make it look like it was just born.

Maybe the teachers and principals can help do some cleaning up to cause the student cant do al the work. And if they could that is not fair if they do cause they need to do some of they other stuff like practise for a sport or some thing that they need to get better at.

I think that it is a wonderful idea to do community service in the neighborhood. But i don't think that it should be required of us to do community service. It should be whither we want to or not. Because some of the students aren't going to do it no matter what you or a teacher says.

Me I would be able to do some community service. whether it is helping someone with a grandchild or pet or going grocery shopping for them. I would be able to do that. But most of them won't do yard work or most of those things that i just said. There to lazy to do things for others.

There are some students who I think would do community service. Because they go to church and are use to do things like that. But most of them won't even pick up a rack to rack there own yard. So how are they going to do that for someone else. I really don't know .

There schedule revolves around them selves. There video games and cell phones. That is what there lives surround. Themselves and there electronics. That is all they care about. Them selves and no one else. So I think that making everybody do community services is a bad idea because your not going to have a lot of people helping out. But maybe if you make it during school they will.

So do it during school. Field trip you might get a little bit more. Make it a time when they are away from there electronics. Maybe you will get more out of them . they have to be at school any way. so why not make it fun. You don't even need a bus you could walk around and go door to door. Asking people if they need anything.

I'm pretty sure that you might get some people that need help. You could do it class by class on a nice sunny day in the summer time when we come back to school.

Concerning your choice on whether to make all students do community service or volunteer. I think you should let each student make their own choice.

Being able to clean-up your community is wonderful and you should be proud to do it. Taking care of your surroundings is just like taking care of your home, because it is your home. Sure, i would love to come and pick up trash, waste, and recycle a little too. I wouldn't care what my friends who didn't want to clean-up say i would go and help out my community. There is too much time in a day for you to just sit around and waste it, so get up and help out and show some respect to those who really care. To show elementary students that you should clean your community will make them appreciate this world instead of making it into a litter ball. For example, i would wanna be one of the leaders of a group as a position.",2,Community service,Independent

I think that students should be required to do community service because helping others is a good way to build character.

Doing community service makes you feel good about yourself because you have helped accomplish something or make a needed change in your community.

It is good to help people that are less fortunate than you because it shows you're caring and compassionate.

Helping people in the community will show students what other people have to go through and deal with, which will help them to be less selfish and not take so many things for granted.

I think students should be required to do around 2-3 hours of community service annually because if students have sports or other after school activities they might not have a lot of time to perform community service.

I think every student is perfectly capable of performing a couple hours of community service.

Students should do a type of community service that helps a topic or idea that interests them.

For example if a student likes animals they could volunteer at an animal shelter or if the student enjoys cooking they could volunteer at a soup kitchen.

Students may think that performing a little community service won't help change the world at all, but even helping someone in a small way can make a big difference.

Helping your community will make students better, more admirable and more respected people.

Students who volunteer when they're young are more likely to continue volunteering when they're an adult.

Then when they get married or have children they can show them how good it is to perform community service.

Students should be required to do community service because I believe it will help them become a better person.

I think that students should have to do community service. The students would help the community to come a better place. It might help the kids stay out of drugs and gangs. The students would help the environment for the community. The only thing kids about is the drugs and gangs.

If the principal made students that were bad do community service . It would keep most of them out of the drugs and gangs. I think that the principal should make kids do community service to keep them out of trouble. The community would make kids realize what they would do to their future if they got into the gangs and drugs. So i think that the principal should make kids do community service.

I think community service would be great for the students, so they can get their head off of school for a couple of hours. The principal should make the students do community service to help the city. Also to get rid of all the trash that's just laying around. Or maybe help clean up parks for kids and them to hang out on. Maybe they could help at a shelter home for a couple of hours and see what they might end up living in if they stay in the drugs and gangs.",3,Community service,Independent

I believe that children should be required to do community service because it shows that its important to help others. I think that this should be pushed on to the students so then they start to help their community become a better place.

I think that students need to be informed in the different things that they can do in their community. Such as, helping make a community garden or making a basketball court outside of school. I don't believe that most children think that they can do anything in the town to help. Therefore, if you make it required that children have a certain amount of hours in before they graduate high school, that it will help them become aware of the things that they can do. I believe that if children know that they have a say and can do something in the town, that most kids may focus more on the positive things and not negative. Such as, more kids will get together to do group projects that they will all enjoy and not doing things that could harm themselves and others. Children will be able to be with their friends and doing something good for the community at the same time.

Students also can do stuff for their school, for example starting groups to get foundations to help with the softball and baseball fields or getting new goals for the soccer fields. The kids being in group projects to help their town and themselves. Many students have a technology class that they're enrolled in, so they can make benches and donate them to the town. Students that are in different clubs can also do different things that can help, for example saving money up for different things and donating the money to different places, such as charities, cancer researchers and to the community to help with the different things that the needs to be done.

Children can do and have a big part in many things, so I believe that they should have a chance to have a part and say what they think. I believe this is why students should do community service, not to just help your community but yourself too.",3,Community service,Independent

I think it is a good idea that students have required community service hours.

Because it would give us a chance to give back to our community, help people in need, and it would give us a chance to see how easy we have it.

First off our community is good but it could be better. We have so many activities and sports events which are not cheap. But we students do enjoy them very much. I propose that we have community service hours so that we can raise money to help pay for these sporting events and buy things like equipment or uniforms, or help us go to far away tournaments. After all it is a privilege to play these sports not a nesety. By having these hours it would help our community be able to afford these things that makes our community so great. My next reason is there are people out there who don't have the things we have they don't have the greatest education, they don't have a nice warm bed to sleep in, or maybe they don't have a home at all. So by going to a soup kitchen or donating your old stuff to a group home. What ever it may be just show these people out there who are less fortune then us that we care and we want to make a change in there lives.

Do you get where I am coming from TEACHER_NAME we are one of the best schools in the state so lets be the school that cares about its community as well and the well being of its students to make them into better and more caring people.

I think it is a good idea to make students do some community service. Some people around here need help and if we do this we could help very many families around the state. After school at least 3 times a week we can help a family or person in need.

Kids think that doing this is stupid and they shouldn't have to, but we all need to step up and help out the community. We could give away toys, clothes, and anything else we don't want, don't need, or could be helpful to someone else. Or we could send out ten people to go to every school in the county and read books to people in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade. Some of us can work in a soup kitchen whenever they are free.

Maybe sometime we can have an assembly at our school and we can hire a public speaker to tell us about how helping the community can help us and everyone else! This could be a great idea. And remember it only takes a few people to make a difference! Thank you and have a great day!

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I'm a student at your school. I understand that you are contemplating the idea of initiating community service requirements for the students to perform. In my opinion, this is a strong idea.

Community service performance is a good habit to get involved in. It can teach many life lessons such as; workmanship, hard work, taking initiative, being independent, being kind and generous and even learning different areas of help and work. Knowing these things can help anyone of any age in any area of the country with any task. community service can teach us to be better, more mature students and people. We will grow up with better life styles and we will be respected by many more. These lessons can teach us many things and with that we can apply them to our everyday lives. These skills can assist us during job interviews, school presentations, our future careers and even social events.

Community service can also help with college applications. Though we may not be old enough to be applying yet, community service can help with future applications. If we are accustomed to this idea at a young age, when we get older and are ready for that, we will have no problem completing and exceeding all necessary college application standards for community service.

Community service may not be enjoyable to everyone, but it is greatly appreciated by those around you. Many of my own friends do community service and apply that happy, kind nature to those around them. I also have friends that don't do community service and though I like them as friends, they don't like to get involved, and the ""selfish"" attitude they get when asked to head off to do something for someone else without anything in return makes community service seem more like a chore instead of fun, helpful activities. I'm not always one to jump up and say ""Hey, let's go mow someone's lawn today!"" especially not when I want to hang out with friends and hit up the mall and maybe a movie, but the good, accomplished feeling I get when I do something for someone without payment makes up for the hard work I do.

It may be a difficult decision for you to make being in the position you're in and all, but I believe whole-heartedly that each and every student, though they may not realize it, will learn a lot from this community service requirement. I think it will be a GREAT skill for all of us to have. Morals such as these will follow us through our whole lives and improve us, not only as students but as individual people.

Community service offers an opportunity to kids and adults who feel they want to do something for the community. I being a person who very much appreciate the place we live in, have decided to write this letter to tell you why community service should be required for at least 10 hours every school year. Of course some students wouldn't like that, but it would be a way of teaching them to do good not only for themselves but also for others who do appreciate and want to feel good for what they do.

Knowing that no one wants to be in a dirty or bad community, community service helps build self-control as well as self confidence. Helping out seniors in homes is a great way to help others that after so long of hard working now need a way to know they did a great job in their life and that they're being appreciate. Doing some garden help might be a big mess but it's a great way to help the community out, even at a school. Another good way of helping a student is to have them help those in need, which helps them be thankful for what they have and to not give up on their goals. I am not only saying this for the good of others, I am also saying this with experience, not only from myself but other friends of mines that have changed from the help of doing community service for their school or for another requirement.

I being a helpful person to the community and others who needs the help feel that community service is a pay-off to knowing your helpful. I believe that community service should be required because no doubt that every teacher wants a self-controlled person in their class, I am not saying that every person will be made to be caring or controlled, but they will know that doing those things do pay off when you look back and think at them. Some studies have also showed that helping out does build a self-made person with respect for themselves and others. This will also make the school look good with all the students who do help to create the community better.

I am hoping you think about my discussion and see every way that benefits the school to be better then it is. Of course you may not agree with me in some points of view, but I would really be glad if we discussed the issue, hoping we have the same views, I hope you enjoyed the letter.

I think that doing community service is a good thing and every one should do it, know i can get friends and people to help out to keep are community clean. So we don't hurt our planet, animals, and other things like our population . I think that the principle should acquire kids, teens, and adults to do so that nothing ever happens.

People all over the world should do community service because what would happen our fish die because some of us don't pick up after ourselves and the population goes down in poler bears, pelicans, and all sorts of nice loving veracious animals; because we don't make sure our rode' s, rivers, lakes, animals die so i' m saying everyone should pitch in at one time like on weekends or everyday so we don't loose a whole population because of it.

So Mr. Principle I'm saying that all people weather its student, parents, boys, girls, anybody and everyone should help pick up. know if people like bullies and rude and discourteous people don't help then they should have the right to choose or decide what they want to weather its to help or to not help, but remember if they don't or if they do they do its not our choice if they want to live in a bad or good community their the ones that want to be dirty and disgusting people not us.

So I'm saying yes you should require all students to pitch in and help keep our community clean, and who would want to live in a dirty or unclean place..... not me so Mr. Principle you should do what's right.      ",3,Community service,Independent

Our school should have a community center. The reasons why, are so students can learn what our community needs, how to make our community better place, and why is community important for students to know. Its a great to have a community center to know how we can make things better.

Students think community center takes their time away. but they have to learn what our community needs. students will participate in a group of students making a list what our community needs, therefore students will learn what our community needs! students will present their list of things our community needs! due to that students will be giving extra credit for the ones who have low grades!

Some students don't participate because their friends say its waste of time. it would not be waste of time when you get to know how our community can be a better place for us. students should know that the program is about our own lives, because if our community is bad well our lives are going to be bad. due to that students will want to participate and will want to make our community a better place for us.

some student might say why is the community important anyways, were fine nothing is wrong. but when get to know what our community is, they would want to know about and would want to participate and know why is our community important. students will receive a good grade if they participate in this community because is like an extra credit. due to that their friends would want to enjoy the program because their friend told them about it.

so principal the community center will be a great place for students to learn lots of things. so i guess this will be a good idea for our school. students will learn what our community needs, how to make our community a better place, and why is our community important!

I do not think students should be required to perform community service.

Because students should only perform in any type of community service if they litter or damage any property.

This way it will teach the students that they shouldn't litter and that it is bad, and damages a lot of our property and if they do it they will have to pay for what they have done and suffer a big punishment. For example if someone throws a drink bottle on the ground it is there responsibility and they should clean it up.

Many students think that littering is a fun thing to do. Littering is a foul habit for a lot of people, most people don't realize how bad it damages our community and pollution. Many elementary schools think that cleaning up litter is very important so they take the time to help our community when they haven't done anything. So i think whoever litters should take the punishment of performing this type of action, and clean up our community.",2,Community service,Independent

I do no think students should be required to do community service. Whether or not someone helps they community is their choice. If they feel like its a waste of time it is their opinion. It might also interfere with their schedule, some students have very packed lives. From the time they get up in the morning to the time the go to sleep at night they are go, go, go. They barely have time for themselves in a regular week, so it would be hard for them to find them time to help out in the community. As for the people who won't help because they don't feel like it or because they want to do some thing else that's their choice, granted it's not a very good choice but it is theirs. They are the ones who will have to live with the choices they made in life not you.

In addition if you make it a requirement for us to do community service it may cause problems. The students that don't feel like doing it or don't have time to do it may not do it at all, and if you made community service part of our grade and they don't do it they might start failing in school because of the grades they are not receiving due to not doing community service. The last thing we want is kids failing in school because they don't have the time to help our community. I do think you should let community service be an exploratory option like art, technology and drama though. It will give the kids who do want to help our community a chance to do so.

Why put yourself through the stress of having to deal with children rebelling against it when you can just not do it. I hope you will choose what you think is best for our school, but i also want you to take my views into consideration and choose not to make it mandatory.",3,Community service,Independent

I believe that doing community service is a great thing. The world needs our help, and would do greatly with the support. Community service is a great way to keep the world and people healthy and happy. I personally think that community services are a great way to get everyone together to do positive things that can make a great benefit towards everything and everyone.

There are many community service projects that we could start doing. We could clean the communities from all the trash and glass on the earth, we could volunteer at homeless shelters and nursing homes, we could paint houses and help civilians with simple tasks like walking their dogs, raking their leaves, mowing their lawns, simple little things like that.

Of coarse we're going to need help persuading people to do these little things. We could inform them about the benefits of having a healthy world and about the things that are happening right now because of the careless acts of others. Telling people about these things will help them get an understanding of how bad things are right now and to do simple, but hard-working things can cause a great change to the world.

I understand that some people think that community service is a waste of time. We need to help them understand that the only way things are going to change are by the acts of others. We wouldn't have a lot of things if it weren't for the kind act of other people. For example, what people are doing in Haiti is a kind act of helping. The water wells that are being built there are helping the Haitians so they can have clean drinking water and cleaning water. I am sure that the Haitians are very thankful that there are people in the world that care.

I hope we can get plenty of support out of this cause and help things become a little better than they are now. Please help me get the support of others and to help me take this writing into action. I really appreciate your help and support.

I think kids should not have to do community service. I think kids that have committed a crime should be forced to do community service. Also i think that if a kid volunteers to do community service then they can, but i do not think a kid should just be told to go pick up all the trash around the city for no apparent reason.

I think that when someone commits a crime they should be forced to do community service because it will teach them not to do whatever it is that they did again. The child should be given a task and a certain amount of hours to do this said task.

I also think that if you volunteer for community service that should be aloud. An example of this is if there was graffiti on a wall in the city i think a group of kids can volunteer and paint the wall and cover the graffiti.

Another opinion i have is that you should not force the kids. What if they have things to do such as sports or other activities. Also it takes to much time for kids they want to do other things not read to children younger kids all day. I think my opinions seem fair enough and better than forcing the children.

Some of my friends are taking some of their time out of the day to perform community service. I understand that you are thinking about making community service a requirement for all students. I do not think that you should do this. Making community service a must for students could make students mad. Community service also takes time out when we are doing homework and studying for tests and quizzes that are very important and count heavily toward our grade.

I feel that forcing kids to do community service would make students unhappy and not put as much energy towards that service that they are doing.

On the other hand, community service could make students better people. Community service could also take students away from they` re treasured video games such as Call of Duty and Halo. Getting students away from these games could make them less violent and overall better people. Also, doing community service could get them out of their tight group of friends and be more in touch with the outside world. It could make them understand the point of charities and maybe the students could help the charities out on their free time.

Over all, i think that you should not make community service a requirement for all students. In stead, you could just make community service an extra-credit assignment or something like that.",2,Community service,Independent

Do you want the children to be uneducated? I know they go to school to get knowledge. But they even need extra help at home when their parents can't help them for their homework. Imagine if children needed help with their homework and their parents were not their to help them. What would they? So if someone is there to help them then the children will not have to stress about their homework. Even if they help cleaning the litter, that would make a world a better place. Our community would look good. And what's the problem if they help clean up litter, help children, baby sit. For example if the children parents are not home, and they need someone to take care of their baby, then you will need a baby sitter to do that. And what is so wrong about that.
