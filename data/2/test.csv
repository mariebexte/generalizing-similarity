6D2C1797E400,"A argument Luke is dealing with from his point of view is how much things he has to do and if he does the commands wrong there will be horrible consequences for them.

When Luke heard about the job he was so excited about it. He heard that being a Seagoing Cowboy was a amazing job. He has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowboy because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowboys, he couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, he was so excited to start working. He worked and worked all the time. He wanted to be the best Seagoing cowboy there has ever been. Sometimes he would work more than he was soppost to. He enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. He went to alot of places. He went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as he was done with all the traveling he made nine trips all together! He made more trips than any Seagoing Cowboy!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip he served his night as a watchman. He had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making his hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. He landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped his slide, that kept him from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for him he was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, he got his ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work he managed his time to have fun on board. He played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. He played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowboy he thought of how amazing it feels to help people. He helped lots of people during his trips. So Luke had a great idea. He wanted people to help other people. He started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But most of people thought he was crazy. He told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called his job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought he was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But He didn't give up on his job though. He liked his job the way it is and he wouldn't change it for anything. He got awards for being a very helpful, admiring, and amazing person in his job.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
03F662678018,"Being a Seagoing Cowboys is a great job and you could become one too. This could be a great for you and im going to tell you a couple of reasons why I like my job and why you should join in with us.

I didnt really know much about this whole Seagoing Cowboys thing but I might as will give it a try i thought so I did and once I got into this it changed my whole live and this can be you too this can change your life too. If you love animals you will love this job as much as I do. They hired me to take care of animals like horses,young cows, and mules that were shipped oversea and this could also be you. You could take care of all these animals. I made nine trips the most of any seagoing cowboy and maybe If you joined the seagoing cowboys program You could beat my record and go up to 10 11 12 or higher. But the best thing about this is when you get to travel you get to go places you have never ever in your life dream of going. You get to go places like

Europe, China , Greece, and even Italy and have a good time . And you get to go on cattle boats for me they were unbelievable. But a good thing about this job was that you still get time for yourself and get to relax.

These were a few reasons why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure it opens the world to you. And you should join you will have a lot of fun in this program Its also will open the world to you.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
CB72F33633C1,"So this is what i think about why you should help the seagoing cowboys. Also why you should sign up.

I think you should join them because they helped people that lost everything from World War II. They would sail to Europe in cattle boats so they could give cattle, and meat to everyone that was devastated by the war. They also got to see alot. You got to sail past alot of places so you could see the great wall of china and all those tuorist attractions. They also got to help people like charity or like helping at a senior home if you are in to that stuff then you should sign up.

In the story it menchaned how they got to see so many diffrent countries. So you would have alot of fun. You could see many tourist attractions like the Great Wall Of China, and thats onlly one think of all the others. You also got to play games on the boat so you wernt always board. There was alot you could do. You also had alot of freedom.

Last but not least the goodness about it. This job would put happieness in your heart because when you bring the cattle, and food you are helping the homeless and the poor. Those people that got everything tooken away your there refuge and to me that would make me happy. So being kind putting other in front of you so they are happy is a good deed.

I think thats why you shoudl join so you can help the people that need saving, and also you get to see stuff you might never get to see again.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

I did things I didn't know I could do. I got to see amazing places and do amazing things. Even if I didn't have anything to do with the animals, me and my fellow cowboys played lot's of games and had tournaments.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy also made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs. It made me realizie that I am helping lot's of people. I am helping people have food to eat. This awareness stayed with me, this led my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Some other people think it is dangerous to be a Seagoing Cowboy. I do think that sometimes it can be dangerous. That is why there are multiple people on the ship so they can help you when you get hurt, or can take over your job so you can heal.

My days as being a Seagoing Cowboy were amazing. I had lot's of fun and helped lot's of people. I hope that lot's of other people will have the same experiance that I had.          ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
DA02B96721FB,"Splash, splash, splash what do you think of that sound every night just before you go to bed. This is what the Seagiong Cowboys hear every night. Caring for animals all day on a boyt can be very hard work, but it is alway fun and intergetic work. It is the most exciting adventure you could ever do in your life time, so just try it. When I first heard about the trip it was like th emost amazing thing ever.

Never before in my life had anything seemed so great. The trip wass fantastic, just all the scenery and things you saw. You get to meet and be with other Cowboys. You learn to trust and like to be with animals. It just so I would really advise you to at least try it and see how you like it at sea for so long.

You get pulled in right away whoever you are old or young. There are games such as table-tennis tournaments,fencing, boxing, and the cowboys also play baseball and volleyball in the stalls where there aren't any animals in. You could also read, or wittle to help pass the times when you didn't have anything to do. You aso have a lot of oppertunities to do diferent jobs aound the bout.

When I was on my second round giong along with the Seagiong Cowboys I surved as a night watchman. When you get this job you have to go around every hour and check on the animsls and see if they are all right. While diong this I slipped and fell which was a scarey thing because I wa sheaded strait for the edge of the bout. Lucky me I was caught and only had a brocken rib.

You can also become a very well know person if you do oit right. I am so thankful I went to help, as I said, "" I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" I have helped so many international students and and exchange visitors for years. This trip has made my life such a bliss since I agreed to sign up for that trip to take care of the animals while they get shipped across the ocean from place to place and to time.

As I have been telling you just try to and juust see how you like it. When I came oout of high school I was working two part- time jobs and had a best freind named Don Reist. When he came up to me and askekd me if I would do it I couldn't say no. I knew this would be my only chance in a life time. So why don't you try this, or if you don't like it tey something else.

In this story He will tell you in his point of veiw. How he feels about the program and why he would want to join. Personally I think I would join from the sounds of it. I think he loved it and the opportunity was great because he took it and you might end out just like him.

Second , I think that you should join the program because you can go on amazing adventures. And you might travel by water day and night. I bet you can even have lots of fun in europe. And by adventures I mean going through the ocean and climbing mountains. When you travel on water you will go on boats and cross oceans.""Let us say that you can go to europe to florida to england. Yeah thats how fun it is see that's why should join.

Third, another few reasons you should join is because. You might even see whales, dolphins and fish and I know some people love to eat fish with fishing poles. And you should join because you don't know you might even make new friends. I personally love to fish because you discover new fish and if you want you can eat them. So those are the reasons for you to join this program.

In conclusion, I am trying to persuade you to join. Well I did the best I could do to persuade you. I hope you deeply consider it. It's Lots of fun and you will go places you dreamed of going.

DFB662FD0C42,"The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great idea. There are a lot of reasons you should join I will give you some reasons. This really should make you want to sign up right after you read it.

You are helping innocent people who servived any war, because it was left in ruins. Anyboby who joined got to go around the world for free to help people. If you have some free time you could even go sight-seeing. You could just see the happiness on an innocent child or adult to lighten your day up. If you like animals you could be around them all day long.

Luke once said ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing Acroplis in Greece was special,"" he aslo said . "" So was taking gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke got toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal while he was on his way to China.

If you go it's not like your the only person on the boat with a whole lot of animals. You can even have some of your friends sign up with you and that is even better. Just think of it like your on a boat with a lot of every people getting ready to help people. Every one else on the boat can become your friends so it's not just you and some strangers it's you a whole lot of your friends.

Don Reist invited him to Europe on a cattle ship. Of course Luke could not say no to this offer when he knew it was an opportunnity of a life time.

Luke would also have time with other people when the animals were boarded off they would play in thier stalls with volley balls or table tennis, boxing,fencing,reading and other game that passed time by.

It is much, much more than just an adventure. It is a way to open up the world to yourself and others. I just couldn't say no, and you won't say no either! These are just a few of reasons why more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

It is an opportunity/experience of a lifetime! There are many great adventures and ways to have fun. We got to take an amazing tour of a excavated castle in Crete. We also got to see China and Europe. Also, getting to see the Acropolis in Greece was very special. We also got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. The streets in Venice, Italy are completly water!

We also have a lot of fun on the return trips, after all the animals are dropped off. We have competitions and play many games. We play games such as, baseball and volleyball in the empty animal holds. We also have many competitions such as, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, reading, whittling and much more! We have so much fun once the animals are dropped off!

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was the most amazing experience ever. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity. It opened up the world up to me! I'm grateful for the opportunity.

It was to help many countries that had been scarred by World War II.

These people helped with cattle and other animals that were shipped to Europe to help them.

People were asked to help by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, or UNRRA.

People should join the Seagoing Cowboys progam because, you get to help other countries and people, you get to see many parts of the world, and you have fun.

If you are in the Seagoing Cowboys progam, you can help other countries by giving them animals for food and work.

It makes you feel good about yourself.

The article says, "" It made me more aware other countries and their needs.""

That would make someone feel good about themselves for helping other countries.

Wouldn't that make you feel good?

In the Seagoing Cowboys program, you can see many parts of the world depending on where you are going.

You could see Italy and other countries.

The article states, ""Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China.""

That would be very exciting.

How would you like to see a bunch of different countries while working?

You wouldn't have to pay for travel

While working for this program, you would also have fun.

The people aboard the ship would play games on the way back to get more animals.

The cowboys would also play baseball and other games in empty ship holds where the animals were on the way there. Also the article even states that they played games.

Even though you are working, you will still have fun.

So, if you are in the Seagoing Cowboys program, you will have fun, you will feel good about yourself, and you will also get to tour and visit many different parts of the world.

Many people helped with the Seagoing Cowboys program.

They helped many countries in Europe.

The cowboys still got to do what they always did, help with animals.

2AEF9CECD887,"A Seagoing Cowboy's Journey

Imagine going to many sites that many people don't normally see and having mulitple adventures around the world. It is an unforrgetable experience that you don't want to miss. You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program becasue of the fun-filled games and freetime, helping the struggling individuals and families, and seeing the unquie sites.

First of all, having some freetime and playing some games onboard is simply a time to relax and enjoy the great experience. Many of you may say that the games don't matter. You just want to travel the world and save as much people as possible. Even though that may be true, I belive that the games benefit in many ways, like making new friends and just having some tine to relax. The cowboys and I have played baseball and volleyball in some empty holds where animals have been housed. Other things to do in your freetime could be reading, boxing, whittling, table-tennis, fencing, and so much more! It has helped me have a better time onboard.

Secondly, helping struggling individuals and families make you feel joyous inside. Some people may say that you don't want to help as many people and go enjoy the amazing sites and play games with fellow companions. And, helping people is really dangerous. But, I belive that if you do, it can make you a better person inside and out. And it doesn't just have to be people either; it can be animals too. Caring for the animals on the way to China kept me busy which was a good benefit because the trip to China took about a month. They had to be fed and watered two to three times a day. It helped me be more responsable and hard working. As for the struugling people, I helped people recover their food supplies, animals and more. The benefits were that same as those with the animals. The knowladge of helping someone or something is one of the best feelings in the world.

Lastly, touring the sites was the best thing for me to experience. Multiple people might say that they don't care about the sights and they just want to do something else. But, I believe that if I didn't see those wonderful sights, I wouldn't be determined or encouraged to finish my job as a Seagoing Cowboy. It was an unbeliveable opportunity for me and it will be for you. I was able to see Europe and China! Two things that were special to me were seeing the Acropolis in Greece and taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. In Italy, many of the streets are water, which made my experience to Italty even more exciting. On the way to China, I also marveled at the Panama Canal and toured an excavated castle in Crete.

In conclusion, you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because of the fun-filled games and freetime, helping the struggling individuals and families, and finally, exploring the unquie and wonderful sights around the world. I am very grateful for the amazing opportunity and it made me more aware of people and their countire's needs. You should think about participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program today!

In the text it states ""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water"".

I crodded the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice. At first i knew nothing about this program until my friend invited me and now, im glad he did because it was an adventure to never forget.

You get to go on adventures, and visit unique places such as Europe, China, sail across the Atlantic Ocean, and visit Greece. During these adventures you meet new people, see new cultures and how people live. You also help people around the world. When I help people in need I feel good inside knowing that im helping and making a difference in the world. Also we found that we could have fun on the ship, we played baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games that fullfilled our time.

Overall, I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboy club for these reasons. You feel like a better person by helping people, you see the world and different countries, you go on adventures, and have fun while doing this by playing games and doing hobbies. Why would anyone take up this once and a life time opritunity?

I have had great new adventures in this program. I think people should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it helps out others (including animals), you get to go new places with new people, and because it is a great opportunity.

My first reason on why people should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it can help out people in need.""UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."" That is one example that the program lets us help, not only just the people but also the animals too. I also found ""They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece- with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them."" That is one reason why people should join this program.

Another reason people should join this program is because you get to go new places in the world, for example I went to Greece! ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" Also another piece of evidence is ""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy; a city with streets of water."" This is another example of why new people should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

An example is because it is a great opportunity for people. You get to do so many new things with new people. "" But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger."" Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an eye opening experience for me. I also found in the text is states

These are just a couple reasons why I think people should join the Seagoing Cowboys. It can help others and animals. It is a great time you will have with people and with all the new places you can see and explore. I had fun with this program and I think a lot of otherr people can too.

UNRRA hired ""Seagoing cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.""

That give a good reason to join the UNRRA because you can help bring farm animals to places where there are no farm animals. You can help the farm animals find a home. You would be able to bond with other animals and save them from the wild and then take good care of them.

""With a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them."" This shows another reason to joins the program and help feed the farm animals over seas.

The most special parts of my trips were seeing the Acropolis in Greece, and taking a gonola ride in Venice, Italy. When you join the Seaging Cowboys, you will get to see much of the world like I did.

The last reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is it is lots of fun, especially after the animals have been unloaded.

It's not just working with animals, feeding, and watching over them. You have lots of fun playing games like baseball, volleyball, and boxing. You have lots of down time with the long trips there and back, and not having to care for animals on the way home after they are unloaded. It is a lot of fun being a Seagoing Cowboy!

The benefits of joining the Seagoing Cowboys program include helping other countries in need, a lot of free time with amazing experiences, and meeting new people that he worked with and the people that he helped recover. First, I will talk about how becoming a Seagoing Cowboy would not only benefit you but also benefit other people in countries that had been damaged from the wars.

The main reason Luke had joined the Seagoing Cowboys program was to help other people that lived in countries that had been involved in the wars. Luke joined the program to help them recover and Luke had said ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Luke had been talking about the Seagoing Cowboys program. Luke's family also hosted many international students and exchange visitors for many years. Luke learned about the current situation in other countries while on the trip while he was helping other people at the same. Secondly, I will talk about how Luke got a lot of free time and got to go to many places such as Greece.

The rides were not quick because the Seagoing Cowboys had to cross oceans. It took two weeks to a month to get to their desired destination. Luke was often kept busy with the animals to care for but when they were returning, he got a lot of time that he could spend with the other people on board or visit locations. Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece, ride a gondola in Italy, tour a castle in Crete, and visit the Panama Canal in China. Luke also often did activities with the other men on board such as play sports in the space they had after unloading the animals. Luke was grateful for the opportunity of becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. Next, I will talk about how Luke got to meet new people.

Luke had just been invited by his friend, Don Reist, to go on a cattle ship so he didn't know many people on the ship. Luke got to meet the other Seagoing Cowboys during the acitivities onboard the cattle ship. Luke also got to meet new people in the locations he visited. Luke got to travel the world and meet new people from different places. It exposed Luke to the needs of countries and that was one thing Luke learned while being a Seagoing Cowboy. Finally, I will discuss why it would be a good idea to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy had been hard work but it also had many benefits. Luke not only helped others but learned something about other people in other countries. Luke had many benefits from joining the program such as helping other people in different countries, having a fun time with other people, and meeting new people. in conclusion, becoming a Seagoing Cowboy could benefit anybody.",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Second of all do you see how much help and care your giving . In the passage Luke cared for animals during the crossing , he fed them , and cleaned after them .

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a fun experience in many ways. One way is all the places that you travel to. I have seen many landmarks, such as the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and I also have been through the Panama Canal on my way to China. Also it is a fun experience after the animals had to be unloaded, we all played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed. Also there would be table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and many more fun activities. Those were all some ways we had a fun experience during the program.

Our program also takes care of animals, but that can also be fun in many ways. One way is that it can keep you busy is when you are caring for the animals during crossing. They have to be fed and watered three times a day. What helped me prepare for hard work was when I would help on my Aunt Katie's farm as a boy. Also I would serve as a night watchmen, which meant I had to check on the animals every night. Once I almost died doing that job one rainy night. As you can see, taking care of animals can be hard but also fun here at Seagoing Cowboys program.

My favorite part was traveling to many countries and all the beautiful sights. I have gotten to see Europe and China during our journies.

0F59D84E92E6,"It's a once in a lifetime oppurtunity like I knew for people to help others and explore around the world. When you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get to take care on not just animals, but also people in need. As I said ""Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China,"" I said. Also in Venice,Italy it was ""A city with streets of water."" As you travel to theese far away places you also haft to take care of animals along the way.

Caring for theese animals willl sure keep you busy, but it is quite easy all you do is feed them, water them, and clean stalls. This experience is also good with connecting with people on the ship. I had fun on board with games such as baseball,volleyball,tabel-tennis,fenncing,boxing,reading,and other games past the time. With this journey it made me aware of people of countries and there needs. So join not only the Seagoing Cowboys for helping people, but also the exsperience.

Even though on the Seagoing Cowboys program you get to see cities and have fun, but it is also a tremendus amount of work. As you said taking animals is actually hard dependig on what animal. You need to clean,feed,and give water to animals every single day. Sure you have breaks but it is still a lot of work for one person. Not to metion this exsperince is on a boat. Most people either have sea sickness on boats as well you have a extreme chance of crashing,sinking,drowning,and also falling off board into endless ocean.

While travilling all over the word you haft to deal with climate and time change. It will take some getting use to constantly changing weather and sleep schedules. Also its very hard to even sleep on a boat with sailing on dangerous waters in the dark every night. While caring for people is a great deed to do it is aslo hard watching people suffer everyday even though your helping them you can still think of other people in that situation as well.

It was very difficult sometimes to be on a boat for about a month because you have to keep everything clean and lift hay and oats on the boats and do all of your jobs all of the time. I know this because in the text it states,""Bales of hay bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. I also know it was probaly a little difficult because the text also states,""Stalls had to be cleaned.""I could tell that was very hard by the sound of it and how I can picture it happening.

One can achive information that they did not know. We have seen and experience many sights of wonders, such as riding a gondola in Venice, Italy, we have toured a excavated city in Crete, and marveled the Panama Canal to China. These sights were amazing to see and experience. One should sign up so that they can do adventures that they may not be able to do in their area.

There are some down sides though. It takes a while to get to these resort, but it is worth it. It took us about 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean to reach China. On our ship we have many objectives to keep ourselves busy; including: feeding our animals, night guarding, and cleaning stalls. One day when we returned the animals, we played volleyball and baseball in the empty stalls.

EDB3E229D251,"MOO! There are many animals a seagoing cowboy has to care for and deliver.

I Luke Bomberger was asked by my friend Don Reist to try out the program. Being a seagoing cowboy is a lot of fun, you can do a lot of things as one. You help people in need by giving them things they need. There are many reasons to join the seagoing cowboy program.

I started out by heading to Greece, and I turned eight-teen. I was old enough to be drafted then, but when my draft board figured out I was on a cattle boat they said to keep doing it as my draft service. When I was discharged I had made nine trips. I had went to Europe and China when I was a seagoing cowboy. I had fallen once, but I didn't go overboard. During your trips you have to care for the animals, by feeding them and giving them water.

When you're not working, you can do many things, like play games, read, and even fence. You can also see some places off the boat. When I was little I used to help out on my aunt's farm. It helped prepare me for being a seagoing cowboy. I had a lot of fun being a seagoing cowboy, because there were so many things to do.

You should be a seagoing cowboy, because you will be able to care for many animals, and you can see other countries. You can also play games to pass the time between trips. Being a seagoing cowboy would be the time of your life. You could help others while having fun yourself. It is a great program that helps others.

There are many reasons to join the program, like the ones I just mentioned. You can spend your time having fun, or you can just try it out to see if you like the program. You might end up how I started, by trying it out and end up liking it. You should join the program, because it helps people in need. In the future there might be other programs like this one.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
2BE4741F0CF6,"The problem we have at hand here is whether or not we should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. My thesis is we all should join the program and help everybody ravanged by the war. It helps a ton of people get better and it also gives you a good gut feeling that everybody loves to have. In the following text I am going to give you some of the reasons why we should all join the Seagoing Cowboys program and help other people.

My first reason we should all go into the Seagoing Cowboys program is you get the wonderful oppertunity to help other people. The people you will be helping have had there homes destroyed by war and all of their personal belongings including food, water, and any gifts they might have gotten. Think about the smiles and tears of joy when you arive at these peoples' houses bearing gifts of food and animals to keep them stocked up on food.

My second reason we should all join the Seagoing Cowboy program is you get to see all of breathtaking sights as you travel the sea on a boat. These places you will be going to will have a ton of awesome sight seeing spots on the way to enjoy with all of the other Seagoing Cowboys. Also once you drop off all of the animal you can do a lot of really fun stuff with all of your buddys. For example vollyball, baseball, and a lot lot more cool activitys and games.

In the Seagoing Cowboys program it is dangorous and I will give the other side who do not want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program that. I bet if you are saying it is dangerous and it is not worth the risk that you have never tried to help a lot of people before. When you help a lot of people you get the amazing feeling that by risking your one life you probably just saved a hundred more lives just by going on a month to two month trip from the spot you are in to the spot you are going.

In conclusion you should all join the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is a great oppertunity to help other people that have lost their homes and to see a lot of breathtaking sights that you would not normally get to see. It is dangorous but you can see all of the joy and relief that you are giving to the people who have suffered great loss do to the ravanging way the war has treated them. I know that if you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys that you could be the thing that people in other countries dream of coming the next day with the gift of savour for them and their familys.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Many people know, and many people don't know about the Seagoing Cowboys.

In the ecxerpt, Luke was one of these.

Seagoing Cowboys are for anybody and everybody.

In this paper, there will be many details describing why Seagoing Cowboys are for everybody.

There are many details to describe the greatness of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

One detail is because if you are one of these people, than you get to take care of a bunch of poor animals.

A few of these animals are horses, young cows, and mules that are being shipped overseas.

You would also take care of people.

Some things that they would do are help their food suppliy animals and more.

Not just for the people, but for the countries that were left in the ruins.

Another detail is that you get to have a great time while you do it.

Luke for enstince, got to hang out with his other cowboys and have fun.

They would play base ball, vollyball games, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games.

They did these things to help pass some time.

The would also sometimes be able to go sight seeing.

Some people think that being a Seagoing Cowboy is dangerous.

Well, there not completly wrong.

Although being a Seagoing Cowboy can be fun and adventurious, it can also be dangerous.

In the ecxerpt, on Luke's second trip he had to be a watchman.

On one rainy night, he slid down the wet slippery ladder onto his back.

He shot feet first toward an opening on the ship.

Luckly, there was a small strip of metal on the edge which stopped him from ragging vigourusly into the wet and dark Atlantic Ocean!

After that he couldn't work for a couple of days because he had a few broken ribs.

Yes.

Everything in the paragrapg above is true, although, this only happens every once in a blue moon.

In the excerpt this didn't happen to any other of Luke's cowboy buddies.

So yeah it can get a little rough out there, but it only happens very rarely.

People have alot of fun joining this program and they always have a good time while they are here.

As one can see joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is for anybody and everybody.

It Is an amazing and exiting feeling once you know that your helping animals and helping people affected by World War ll.                                      ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Luke went over the Atlantic Ocean 16 times to help WW2 victims and help their community grow and rebuild their city. There are more than 1,000 victims in each world war that happens and just imagine how many animals were killed too.

One way you could join the Seagoing Cowboys would be to simply sign up for it, since Luke claims that he just signed up ,as stated in the text. You could also join the UNRRA and get the opportunity to get to choose every branch that could help victims in need. Even though Luke signed up to help the Cattle boat, he got to go sight seeing in China, Acroppolis , Venis,Italy and the Panama Canal.

Out of all of the time, Luke was on the Cattle boat , but in the text it states that he did the same things on his Aunts farm, but did not help him at sea. One day a bad storm hit and he landed by the animal pens and landed on a pice of metal , he could not work for a few days because of his broken ribs. He was happy to be alive but when the animals were shipped the crew would play lots of fun games. He had done this 9 times to and from where they were getting dropped off at. Also, he crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times.

After doing this job he helped get awareness of everything and why other people needed to join . He helped most victims with getting a new home and rebuilding their city. Luke enjoyed doing this job and loved playing with the crew after the animals were loaded. For Luke this was more than a job. After all he had to have a little adventure , right?

Are you thinking that you maight like being part of this program? Here are some other good things about being a Seagoing Cowboy.

As I said before, you can help animals that are in danger and get to know them. This gives you a good feeling of helpfulness and compassion. I love to save lives, especially if they're animals'. I also liked to be freinds with them. Even though there are many other people on the boat with you, the creatures all have their own personalities, and this makes them fun to hang out with.

Another good thing about being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you get to see the world. I have seen the Acropolis in Greece, the Panama Canal, and an excavated castle in Crete. I have been to Europe, China, and Italy. You can go to all of these places, see these sights, and more if you join their program.

Fianlly, there are so many people on the boat with you that it is impossible not to make a friend and have fun almost every day. I have made ample new companions. There are also many games played on the ship. They include baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, reading, boxing, and whittling. As you can probably tell, these are all exciting to do with your buddies.

One night Luke had watch, he got into a bad accident that left him without work for a couple days due to broken ribs. When the weather was good, and all the chores were done for the day, the men upon the ship had time to play games or travel to see things. The animals are what kept Luke busy though.

Some other reasons are that you get to sleep in a boat you don't do that very often. Finally on return trips after the animals have been unloaded you play games. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals were. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

But being one is more gratefull for me than an adventure. It opened up the whole world to me. ""I am gratefull for this oppurtunity"" I say ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

But being a Seagoing cowboy has some dangers. This is during World War Two so enemy soldiers could be roaming around. Or also when i was on the boat. I was a watchman. My job was to check on the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making my hourly report to my captain, I slid down a slippery lader on my backside of the ship. A small strip of metal along the side kept me from slidding in to the dark Atlantic. I am happy to be alive. But I couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

I hope you take this into consideration on joining the Seagoing Cowboys to help other people. Also be with your friends and have fun.       ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

To support Luke's claim, in the text it states that, ""To help these countries recover their food supplys, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relif and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of horses, yound cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.""

To conclude my essay, here is some infromation about Luke and Don's journy! For fun they played: volleyball,baseball, table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling, and games. They also played them to help pass the time. The trip also made Luke ""aware of people of other countries and their needs.

C7E183A09074,"The Seagonig Cowboys are a group of people who helped serve after World War 2. They brought horses and small cows to towns that were in ruins. To help these countrys they brought food and cattle. They went across the Pacific and Atlantic ocean to give the homeless food.

People should join this program because it help a town in need of assistance. If they didnt they could starve to death. They need to join this program not just for the people you are helping but to help yourself see the good inside yourself. Take Luke, he is a seagoing cowboy that made 9 trips. That is the longest any seagoing cowboy has ever went.

It clearly states on paragraph 5 that "" Besides helping people, I had a side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" He also says it is an oppertunity of a lifetime. He said he couldnt say no. He says it takes about 2 weeks to get across the Alantic ocean. He went over the Atlantic ocean 16 times and the Pacific ocean twice to help those affected by World War 2.

In the passage it said that fourty-four nations combine to form the UNRRA, also known as the United Nations Relief and Rehabailitation Administration. You should definately join because you are helping others even thogh it might be fun to travel its also a great feeling when you help others. Those are some reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

According to the article Don and Luke signed up to take care of the horses, young cows, and mulesthat were shipped overseas. Luke traveled many times traveling more than any other Seagoing Cowboy at 9 times. He liked traveling but he really like supporting others. For example when Europe was left in ruins as wll as many other countries the Seagoing Cowboys would help them which I can imagine was a tremendes feeling. People will appreciate you more for helping others. Thats another reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy.

In the story it said that the Seagoing Cowboys went to Greece witha cargo of 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them so that they would be healthy which also means that they help the animals too. It also said in the article that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than a adventure for Luke Bomberger, it opened up the world to him, he even said ""I'm grateful for the opportunity. This is especially a good reason because he even said that it was great which means from his prospective he appreciated the oppotunity.

Luke was thankful to help others maybe you will be too.

Moving cattle would be fun ecpecially if you grew up doing it just like Luke did. You could get smarter by doing this you would know how much of what to give a horse or a cow for feed, and you would know how to clean a stall. If you ever retired you could go into cattle from this experience.

If you did this you could have the experience of traveling and cattle but the best one would be knowing you helped all those people stay alive milk and meat from the cows meat from the goat. everyone would love you for giving them food and milk to eat and drink to keep them alive.

FE40A50DF994,"My name is Luke Bomberger, and I just got back from an amazing trip from being a Seagoing Cowboy.

I got to help animals recover from World War ll, and this trip was an amazing, and beautiful adventure. This program is hard work, and I know that some people aren't interested in helping animals, or working hard.

But, this is a really good program that I want to tell you about.

Maybe by the end of this article you will be convinced to join this program with me.

What did I have to do on this trip you ask? I had to help animals recover from World War ll.

This was a fun job, because even though this was hard work the animals are fun to play around with. If you don't take this job those animals won't have any body to take care or play around with them.

I know some of you don't really care for animals, but what's better: watching you favorite Tv show or helping poor animals recover from World War ll ?

The animals are a great part of this experience, but do you want to know what I really loved about this trip? I adored all of the tourist attractions on my way to China, and the great experience this was.

The cattle-boat trips were unbelievable for a small-town boy like me.

Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

I loved the gondola ride in Venice Italy, it was beautiful to see the streets of water.

When I toured that excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China, it was amazingly beautiful.

I was bored with my high school job, so I took this job.

I was not bored anymore.

This job is a great job for someone who loves adventures, sand a hard working job.

I sure hope that this essay has convined you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program, because my arm sure is getting tired from all this writting.

Like I said in the first paragragh, work might not be for some people, or some people might not like animals.

But I am telling you this program is worth the work, with the amazing places you see, and sailing on a boat while taking care of animals.

Hopefully, you will join the Seagoing Cowboys program with me, and if you do this program it will open up the world to you, and you will be writting the next essay to someone.  ",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
9.21E+13,"I think that you should particpate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because their are new things you could learn. Also joining the Seagoing Cowboys program changed my life.

You should join the program if you like going to new places or if you like trying new things. If you love going to new places then this is the program for you because you will get to see a lot of knew places you haven't been before. I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured excavated castles in Crete and marveled at the Panama canal on my way to China, But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. Or if you don't like exploring places you haven't been don't worry because there are plenty of other things for you to do there like for instance when we leave the animals and are on are way back we play tons of games. Also you get to meet knew people there, so you would end up makeing tons of friends. Also a lot of times when people participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program they end up tying new things they would't normally try or that they haven't tried. Also joining the program helps build you into a better person because you're helping out with the animals. Another thing is that the cattle trips were amazing for a small-town boy like me. When you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you will learn to take care of animals. If you're a bit affraid of animals don't worry they won't bite, well they might bite, but only if you make them really mad. It takes alot to make them mad though, so you will be okay and you won't need to worry about anything.

Some people might just say it is a useless way to spend your time, but I disagree because a lot of good things could come from it. Like you could make a lot of new friends there or you and your friends could join the program together to spend more time with each other. who wouldn't want to spend time with there friends playing games like table-tennis tournaments, fencing, and boxing. Or you could just read to pass time if you really wanted to. If you joined the Seagoing Cowboys program I think you would have a lot of fun. If you can't sleep or you like sleeping late you could be the nightwatcher. A nightwatcher is a person who watches over the animals.

I'm greatful that I had the opportunity to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it changed my life for the better, if my friend Don hadn't invited me to go with him to Europe on a cattle boat then I wouldn't had signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. I am so grateful that he took me with him to Europe.

If you get the opportunity to join the Seagoing Cowboys, I think that you should join the program. It really is a oppotunity of a lifetime, so you should say yes and step out of your comfort zone if you don't like things like that. You know it is good to try new things. If you do decide to join the Seagoing Cowboys program I hope you have a good time.

2D21E920F1B0,"I entered a program before called the seagoing cowboys how it all started though was because of my friend don reist. I was working two part time jobs at a grocery store and a bank and when my friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

I got to travel a lot to. So here is why I am asking you to join the program just like I did.

I know you probaby won't do it but I am just going to try my best to convince you so the first reason is since the (UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the horses,youngcows,and mules that were shipped overseas.) That means you would get to help out other countries and their disasters. Another reason you should join is because you get to travel all kinds of places in the world ( Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the acroplis in Greece was special"". he says)which he is actually me. One more reason why is because (luke/I also found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty hold where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass time.)

So there are 3 reasons that I wrote out of why you should be a seagoing cowboy and if your a girl I suppose you could be a seagoing cowgirl. Now I am not forcing you to but just convincing you and I hope that convinced you because all of it is really true.

I suggest u people too come out and help us out with the people who lost all of there resourses from World War ll. So if everyone come out to help us with these people we cn change there lives and our lives by helping them. Also I wouldnt be doing this with out Don he got me into all this and i just couldnt say no, and we have been doing this for a couple of months and we love it!

We can all help out by being a Seagoing Cowboy and when we are done with these events we have alot of extra time so we can visit places around where evever we are! For an example I toured an excavated castle in Crete and i view at the panama Canal on my way to China! So not all of what we do is boring we do alot of worthy things and fun things.

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece that means he could of maybe joined military. Luke said it took about 2 weeks to travel across the Atlantic Ocean. It took a month to travel to china from united states. There lucky because they had 335 horses on the cargo ship with enough food and hay.

Luke had to take care of all the horses it was his job. It was no big deal though when he was a little kid his aunt made him work on her farm to be prepared. Just in case he did work in a farm in future and look he is taking care of animals. On Luke's second trip he was a night watchman. All he had to do was check on the animals every single hour.

Luke loved being a Seagoing cowboy it was more than he ever wanted. He had some scary moments but you have to face some fear.
