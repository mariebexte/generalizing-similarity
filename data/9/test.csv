Hi, this is one of a student from the SCHOOL_NAME. I am writing this letter to talk about the policies our school is having. The policy that i will be talking about is the cell phone policy.

I think our school should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, but as long as the phones are turned off during class time. Because we have busy students, their parents will be calling them to inform them on what they should do. I agree, sometimes students do get carried of with their phones. But some students don't have phones, so don't think to hard about this. Students do want to text with their friends, and they can because sometimes school gets boring, but I think that instead of focusing on what to do with the phones, you should focus on what to do with the classes. The reason students text during class is because the class isn't interesting enough. What I noticed is that more people text in the ""boring"" classes then in the ""fun"" classes. You don't need to confiscate the phones, let the students keep them, but if the classes are better, then the rate of students using phones will decrease. Also if the work is to hard, students might text some answers to each other, so don't make the work to hard either. I'm just saying, its your decision. I also use phones, and I love to text, but sometimes play games or text other people when i get bored and sometimes I get texts from my friends asking me what the answers are to a problem or something like that.

Sincerely,

The SCHOOL_NAME

P.S. I don't mind if you do confiscate the phones but barley anyone has a phones. We don't talk in phones anymore, we text so its quieter.      ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent

Students should be allowed to bring their phones at school and use them during free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. Some students need to have their phones at school with them. If you allow students to use phones during free times they won't try to sneak to use their phones during class. Phones are sometimes a necessity. They can be used in school responsibly and turned off in classes.

Many students participate in after school activities. Sometimes these practices or club meetings can be cancelled or delayed. Students may be stuck waiting for hours with no one to call if cell phones are not allowed at school. Students need cell phones at school for extracurricular activities.

If you don't allow students to use cell phones they will just use them behind your back. They will hide them and use them during class. If you allow them to use cell phones during free times they will use them then and not during class.

Some of these people need a phone for emergencies and taking them away could have a negative affect on these students. Students can be trusted to turn off their phone during classes. Although teachers should be allowed to take these phones away if they see them or hear them during class. Some of these students will be driving in a couple of years but you can't trust them with a cell phone.

Taking away phones could do horrible things to your school. Cell phones are a necessity in some students life. You need to trust your students with cell phones. Consider allowing students to use their phones during free periods.

C97AF423A6AA,"Policy 2,

Students like using their phones, but usually don't know when to turn them off during class. There are many times when their caught using the phones during class or other free time. While in school you may see students walking the halls and maybe some have a phone. Should you not allow anyone to use the phones or should they?

When in a class most students are talking to others by texting them from another class. It's harder for the student to do any work and also to bring their grade up if their failing. It's easier if you wouldn't allow them to use the phones during the class time in fact not allow them to use them at all. Even if they had free time they should finish their book or their homework.

Try watching them more often to make shore they don't turn them on they should be aloud to bring them in but not aloud to use them at all. If you see someone use the phone take it from them and give it back at the end of the day. If they continue then take it and tell them if they don't stop they'll never get it back again. If the teacher can't stop it or if you can't tell the parent about it and talk to them. Tell them everything that has happened each day their child has used their phone. If their not satisfied they might take away the phone from their child and only allow them to use it when they are in need of help.

Talk to the students in the school about using phone safety they maybe talking to a friend or someone that claims to be there friend, a student that may not like them. If none of this helps then ban phones from the school and only allow them to use the office phone if a student needs to call someone.

Should you allow them to use the phones? Well no, it may not be so bad a first but once they start getting out of control it'll be harder to pull them away. They should be banned and not allowed, even I don't bring my phone and never need to use it. They should get used to not using them in awhile.            ",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

If the principal is considering a new cell phone policy there are a lot of things she should know. If she has a policy where students can use their phones during lunch and nution' but during class would be great. Many kids would enjoy coming to school because they can talk with their friends but when class time came they would have to turn off their phones. If the other police that phones ant be used at all wouldn't be good.

With no phones kids would text during class when the teacher isn't looking. They would be loosing there education and the teacher would be planning a great assignment and no one would be listen. They would be unaware of what was going on in class. If the teacher tells them you have a test this day they wouldn't know when to study because they were so interested in their phones.

If they had the police that phones could be used during nutrition and lunch a lot more kids would like that. They'd like it because they can socialize with friends while they get an education. That way they can just reply to their friends when class is over or if the class is having free time they can talk to their friends. Many students say they are going to the library to get a book when they get any book they put the phone in the book and do whatever. That is wasting their time and someone who actually wants to read the book. They think the book is being used for good things when its not.

If the school is trying to change the police they should think of the good things and bad things that would happen.      ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
1F150143FE89,"School policy

I think that we should be allowed to use are cell phones during lunch period do to it being are free time to talk to each other during lunch. If we are far away from each other or to speak with parents at school incase we need to tell them something important, like if I had a test coming up or something was on the counter and I needed mom or dad to grab it for me, or if I left something for them at the house and they did not notice it yet. I believe we should be able to use are cell phones in school lunch period but turn it off after lunch so we are not able to text are friends who are in class and do not disturb there work in progress. These are some reasons why I think we should be able to use phones at lunch, There for I will go with policy 1. Other times during school we should also be able to use cell phones for that time but when the free time is over then we will turn are cell phones off and go on with are normal day. I hope that you agree with the terms listed.

2514C0AD2026,"To our principal,

I fully support ""Policy 1"" on cell phone usage and completely against ""Policy 2"".

I believe that students have a right to bring along a cell phone and carry it on themselves as long as it is not a distraction or disturbance to the learning environment. They should be allowed to use them during instances allowing them.

If they are seen with their cell phones out while a teacher is in the middle of an important lecture, unless he or she has gotten permission from the teacher it shall be confiscated immediately. When there are times allowing cell phones to be used, if a student is caught giving answers to a test or talking to someone in class, their phone should be taken up. One thing that bothers me is students cheat using paper all the time but teachers only get upset when it is done over cell phone. I think it's the same information, just being transferred a different way. There is no telling what students say to each other, using notes or cell phones. It could easily be on both. If a student's phone is taken up for them talking to someone, why do teachers not take up paper notes being passed? They are doing the same action, only on a different device.

I also believe that cell phones are a good way to contact someone outside of school. Let's use someone left their lunch at home for example. It would be easier to let your teacher know and to have them allow to contact their parent via cell phone in class than to have to get permission to go down to the front office, ask permission to use the phone, and then call. Also, some people use their electronic contact book and don't memorize numbers. The school may have your house number on file but they don't have your parent's work number or cell phone number. It would be better to contact them using a number they can recognise. Some people don't answer to numbers they don't know, even with the exception of caller ID.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
DD71BE46AFE9,"I believe that students at any school should but should not have the right to use their phones during any free time that they have and should not allow them to be seen during school at anytime. Phones cause can cause a lot of disruption and problems while using them at school. But, they could also be good for emergencies.

Some reasons how phone the can cause disruption is by going off in class during any kind of important event. They also can cause problems if something bad was going on like a lock down or something it would make noise and that might cause someone to get hurt. Phones would keep the students off task and keep them something focused on the phones instead of what is being said or what is suppose to be happing.

Now I'm not saying that it would all be bad because phone could be a good use of resource sometimes. They would be needed for if something was wrong like if the school was on fire and you didn't have any thing to use you would need your phone. Even like if your mom or someone important was calling you at school to tell you something important it would be needed.

Phones can still be bad for school because if there was a problem or fight is about to happen the student(s) could call others up there and that up cause a huge problem and put everyone in danger.

Now, as you can see this is why I wouldn't or would allow phones to be used during school.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
DFD700856850,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that the policy should be policy 1: ""Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time."" I think that because then students would not be as tempted to sneak there phones in class and text. It would allow them to say what they need to, to who ever they are talking to at the time they are allowed to have their phones out. Then they would not wont to take their phones out during class to text that person as much.

Plus, what if there is an emergency at school? The students could get their phones out at the right time they need to, to call there parents or gardens. This would make it easer for the staff at the school so they wouldn't have to call all the kid's parents or gardens. You never now when there might be an emergency at the school and you would have to call the parents. So the students having cell phone would be able to get a hold of their parents easer.

Those are some of the reasons I think you should change the policy to policy 1: ""Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time."" So that students wont be as tempted to take their phones out in class and incase there is an emergency at the school an you need to get a hole of the parents of that child easer.

Cell phones are not necessary although they are being depended upon too much in today's society. I believe students should not be able to use their phones during the school day. I think you should stay with policy 2 because cell phones cause fighting, not everybody owns a cell phone, and these devices are distracting.

When you wanted to tell your best friend a secret, didn't it annoy you when you had to wait until nobody is around? Well now with cell phones people can just text the secret to their friend so nobody gets hurt right? Wrong. Most people realize when their friends are talking behind their back. If they find out you said something horrible about them they'll probably be as mad as bull that was just let out of his cage. Now your best friend won't talk to you or even be around you long enough to explain what really happened. If she finds out what you sent and it was either something you were told as a confidant or something bad about her then it may even get physical resulting in one or both of you being suspended. All of this could have been avoided if you never sent that text message during lunch.

It's hard to believe but not everybody can afford a phone payment. When a poor student sees everybody on their cell phone it makes them feel left out. Studies show, 67% of fighting is caused by jealousy. Nobody likes being made fun of because they don't have the latest ""in"" clothes and definitely nobody likes being teased of for their lack of a phone. Even if you have a phone it may feel disintegrating when people have the brand new iPhone 4 and you're stuck with your moms ten year old flip phone.

Although the rule is no cell phones during class, students still text and look at their phones while their teacher is teaching. Typically, there are students who don't want to be at school and they think since they don't want to be there nobody else does; but they're wrong. Learning is hard when you hear the buzz of someone's cell phone going off every five seconds. When you hear the noise you can't help but wonder who they're texting and what they're talking about which distracts you from the lesson you are trying to learn. Facts prove, when cell phones are not in the classroom the students averages increase dramatically opposed to those who have cell phones ringing all the time.

All in all, I hope you enforce policy 2. Banning cell phones from being used during school will decrease the amount of fights between friends, eliminate pupils from being looked down on for their lack of a cell phone, and help students focus better during school. No one will die if they are unable to text for a couple of hours. Weakening the dependency on cell phones will make this world a better place.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent

The policy you have are very nice. i agree with both policy but if i have 2 chose it will be policy # 1. all though cells phone distract students from the work in class room and many other reason i would really perfume we do have our cells phone in school. and i am not just saying this b. cause i am a teenage and i am a student in SCHOOL_NAME

i am saying this b. cause we have all day with our phone. while we are in our classes they will be off like policy # 1 said in the first sentence ""Allow students to bring phones to school"". in the 2 sentences ""as long as the phones are turned off during class"". i know for a fact kids may disobey this rule but it dose not hurt 2 TRY. but if the student phone continues 2 turn on and off there is a possibility the phone will get messed up by turning on and off . if there was an other policy i would have 2 say put our phones on lock or sleep or when we attend our class we put them in a box and when class is over we will get them back. but like i said i agree with both policy. A lot or students may agree with this policy just b. cause it have has 2 involve cells phones and we just want 2 use them cells phone are good in some ways 2 bring them 2 school and in other ways they are not every body has there own opinion.

4FFE43F4135B,"Dear Principal,

I think both policies are phenomenal but, I most likely agree with policy number 1.

I agree with policy number 1 because I think students do have a right to have some time on the phone, but only on their free periods. Hence, what if something happen at home or something happens to any of your family members and your mom or dad calls you? This will count as an emergency call because, you have been called to get a dreadful news. What if something bad happened to you and you have to call your guardian saying that you have to go home because you don't feel good? Anything can happen in the moment you don't expect it. These can be some reasons to why

I think you should bring phones to school.

This are some reasons to why you could bring phones to school, just as long you have them turn off during class time. Only on lunch periods or free times you could use your phones because, you might want to spend some free period on your phone. I agree that you should turn your phones off during class because, that might be a distraction for you and your classmates, but on free periods or lunch time you might as well use your phone. With this statement that I'm trying to state, I wish you understand me, and I hope you would let us bring our phones to school just as long we have them turn off during class time, but turned on during lunch period or free time.

C0635735705B,"Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are going to change the cell phone policy at school. You have provided two options: allow students to use them during lunch and free time, but not during class, and not allow students to bring phones to school at all. Out of these two policies, i believe that policy 1 is a better idea. I can list tons of reasons, but here are just a few.

First off, policy 2 is a bit harsh. If students aren't allowed to bring cell phones to school, what happens if they're in an emergency. Also, phones are a way to communicate with friends and family, about how their day is going, or sometimes you're bored and you want to play a game, well, cell phones have that. I agree that you shouldn't be able to use them in class because they can be very disruptive, but taking them away entirely is just not right.

Secondly, I completely agree with policy 1. If students are allowed to bring them to school, and not use them, then I don't understand what the point of it is. But, when they pull out their new cell phone to show off to their friends in the middle of class, that could be a problem. One, it's distracting to people around them. It can make them look at the phone instead of their work, and then fall behind or get in trouble from the teacher. Also, the phones could ring in the middle of class, and that's a problem. The noise can be loud and disruptive, or the ring tone or whatever they have as their ringer could have inappropriate language. Who knows what's floating around these days. And finally, they can use it to ask for things. What if someone forgot their lunch that day. They could call up their family and ask if they could bring it to school. But, only during those lunch periods and free times.

My last reason is that during those lunch periods and free times, it can get a little boring. Especially if there is no recess because of the weather or some special thing that is going on. With the cell phones, you can do numerous things with your friends during those boring times. You can talk to each other. Also, on some phones, you can take pictures, or record videos and then laugh about it later. There are also games that you can buy and play on certain phones that can entertain a crowd. Aside from those things, sometimes if you get internet access, you can watch videos on certain sites that made you laugh, or had some good music in it with a cool video.

So, between policy 1 and policy 2, I would choose policy 1 all the way. It's better than policy 2 in so many ways and just has good ideas. whether it's calling up your parents to tell them to have a good day or ask for your forgotten lunch, or just talking to friends about what's going on, cell phones are a good thing. So, principal, it's your choice to make, but I hope you make the right decision on this dispute. Thank you for your time.

4ADD9D52FC2E,"Cell phone policies are always an issue in schools around the U.S. In my opinion schools should ban cell phones. Me being a student myself I know exactly what students would do. Students would have the temptation of bringing their phones to classes which don't allow kids to have their phones, they would be a cause of distraction, and detract from a child's educational time.

Kids spend more time on their phones than studying. If phones were allowed in the school during free periods kids would be more likely to bring their phones to classes that aren't free periods. This would cause more kids to face consequences with the administration. If kids traded their phones for books kids would be more educated.

Phones are distracting and everyone knows that. If you were to allow students to have phones during the day it would cause more distractions within a day that don't occur already. Phones are always an issue and will always be an issue. As a student I need to practice what I preach because I am one of those kids who need to trade my phone for a book.

Besides being distracting the phones would also detract from someone's learning. Instead of concentrating on school work kids would be focused on when they would get to use their phones. It would most likely lower kids' grade point averages. It would be an even bigger issue for the country then. So why not stop it now.

Although it would be nice to have the privilege of having your phone during the day, I am against having your phone during the school. Many kids would object to my response but phones are tempting, distracting, and detracting.            ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
B16710F91588,"Principal,

I believe that you should not allow kids to have pones in school because students will get distracted in school.

Even though students will only be allowed to use their phones in their free time in school, I believe that they still will use them when they are not supposed to.

I also believe students will say that they are done with their work just so they can use their phones to text and communicate with their friends.

If their phones are in their lockers turned off then they cant use them and will not be able to get distracted by other students with their cell phones and will not be tempted to text their friends.

Students may also have games on their phones so if they have them in their pockets then they will have them in class and most students are not guaranteed to have their phones turned off so they will most likely play games and not focus on work.

These are some of the reasons why I believe students should not be able to use their phones in their free time at school.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
87A974F87B12,"To the principal of SCHOOL_NAME;

Of the new policy of cell phone, students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school, and to be also used only on free time periods like lunch.

The reason why students should bring their cell phones is because students can use them for emergencies and other uses like calling their parents to pick them up after school. If phones are used in class, they may get a warning or be taken away by the teacher. When taken by the teacher, they may receive their phone after the class period.

When an emergency happens, Students can call their parents or call for help when they are instructed to do so.

Calling their parents can let them know that they are all safe from a natural disaster. Either it is a flood, earthquake, tornado, etc. Students letting their parents know that they are fine shows the responsibility they carry.

Calling parents after school can let them know what time their child gets out of school. When not having a cell phone, certain students have to use the phones in class and/or the ones in the office. If so, they may or may not be able to get out of school on time. Parents always have to make sure they leave on time to know what happens at school and after school.

Having parents to know that their child is doing good in school means that their parents are happy that their child had a grea

The last reason why phones should be brought to school is because that students should enjoy a nice school year. Having a great school year for students means that they can memorize all the times they had for the year. Letting them know they had fun is that it leaves them with a happy day. It can make kids happy for themselves and the people around them. Also it makes friends closer with one another when they talk about their day.

This is why the policy of having phones ay school for emergencies, parent pick-ups, and the excitement for students.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
C17FBC33DB34,"Cell phones are an important part of the 21st century. Many people don't leave their house without one. Over the years, cell phones have evolved so now people can not only call someone from almost anywhere in the world, they can text message them, play games, use the internet, listen to music, and even watch television. But cell phones still have one main purpose: communication. Sometimes, that communication comes in handy or could even save your life.

As for in school, there are situations when using a cell phone would be inappropriate, of course, but there are so many more when it could be necessary. What if a student's bus broke down on their way home from school, and they had no way of reaching their parents? The parents would be very worried when their child didn't come home at their usual time. With a cell phone, they could be informed of the delay immediately and arrange for a pick-up or make appropriate considerations for the time delay.

Or what if the child were to be in danger? Going to school, while in school, or coming home from school, anything could happen. Contacting a parent or the police could save lives. Or on a more simple level, if a teacher needed to contact a child's parent or other adult, chances are the child has all the necessary contact information on their phone. Addresses, phone numbers, schedules, nearly anything can be accessed from that little device.

Cell phones are also important for scheduling after-school activities. Many times, at the last minute, a friend has invited me over after school, and I've had about 2 minutes to get permission and make a decision. Calling my mother took only a few seconds. If I hadn't brought my cell phone to school those days, I would have missed out on many fun times. Also, while on the bus, sometimes I get separated from my friends, and have no one to talk to. My phone is my entertainment for the 15 minute ride.

And while students are in school? Cell phones generally aren't a problem. If a child knows the phone may be confiscated if they have it out during class, they won't take the chance. Those phones will be off and away. However, cell phones can encourage communication between students during times like lunch and other free time. What harm could a mere cell phone do in between classes or during down time? Minimal. They could do much more good than bad, including contacting parents for forgotten papers or just for keeping them updated in their child's life.

In conclusion, banning cell phones from school would do more harm than good. Cell phones are so useful in a number of situations including on the bus, during down time, or after school. Students need their cell phones.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent

I heard that you were changing the Cell phone policy at school and that you haven't picked witch new policy yet. In my opinion i don't think that cell phones should be allowed at school because they can get stolen and are a distraction.

My first example is how a cell phone can get stolen. Most kids bring there cell phones to school and take them around with them, like my friend RELATIVE_NAME. RELATIVE_NAME did not have a P.E. locker last year; So she shared one with her friend. One day she had put her phone and ipod into the locker and left it there over the weekend. Sadly her friend had forgotten to put the lock back onto her locker. The next Monday RELATIVE_NAME came back to get her Phone and ipod. Both had been stolen. RELATIVE_NAME was devastated, Also like most teenagers she was obsessed with her cell phone. Her parents weren't very happy Also.

There was another girl that i knew when i was in sixth grade. At my other school we did not get lockers at all, We all had to carry around back packs.

One day her phone drooped out of her pocket in P.E. and she had no clew where it had gone. All her friends helped her search for it for days. Luckily for her a student found it and turned it in.

My Next Example of why we should not be able to have cell phones at school is because they are a distraction. Last year There was a class that i was in where the teacher let the kids text or listen to music while they worked. The only bad part was that none of the kids worked. And the kids like me who were trying to work kept getting distracted by all the talking, clicking, and the blasting rap music coming from there phones. It gave me a headache. I couldn't stand how much noise was going on and so i did not get much work done and i almost failed the class. One of the student in my class also got enjoyed and told the guidance councilor what was happing. The rest of the year i was able to work in peace because the assistant principal kept coming in to make shore that there was no moor craziness.

To sum it all up, i think that cell phones should not be allowed at school because they are very distracting and can get stolen at school.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

Have you ever, when you were a teen, owed lunch money, and you need to call a parent to drop you off money? This example leads me to believe that policy one is the better choice because teens, and children should be allowed to have their cell phones out at free times such as study hall, lunch and after school hours.

What if, the school policy was that you couldn't have cell phones out at all! How would you be able to eat lunch if you owed money and you couldn't eat because of it?

Also what if you had an emergency and you needed to call your parent immediately and you were not allowed to have a cell phone out at all (policy two )! I believe that students should be allowed to have their cell phones with them as long as they are off in their bag or pocket.

But, this does NOT mean that they should have it out texting, only if an emergency approaches and it is strictly needed. This is why policy one is the superior choice for the school.

I believe that this is a problem because it distracts students through out the day. Even though this is a problem students should still be aloud to a cell phones for safety reasons. If there was something to go wrong at school, you should be able to call a parent or guardian . If you consider this, there should be some rules set into play. The major rule would be to keep your cell phone in your book bag at all times in less there is an emergency.

You should also tell all the teachers that if they catch any student messing on a cell phone for no reason that the cell phone will be confiscated until a parent or guardian comes and gets it. I have thought hard over this policy and i hope you will to. I also hoping to will consider my opinion.

EB1E061F404D,"Cell phones cause lots of rouble during school hours.

They can cause disturbances during class time when a student is called, the lack of social interaction when a student is constantly texting with a friend and lots of the time a loss of focus in his or her studies when a friend calls to inform that their is something better to be doing during a study session.

Students often text or have phone conversations during school hours.

Because of this many students can not work as efficiently as students that do not have these distractions.

In the end cell phones also can get students in trouble when another student calls them during the middle of a seminar.

These distractions can greatly affect a students studies and the ability to communicate in public.

In the end, students who text or have to many calls during class are a disruption and can greatly effect the way other student have to work to stop the distraction.

I also understand that we will not be allowed to them in class and that is fine. Almost all of the students in our school use their phones for personal reasons.

A student who could be allowed to use their phone for their personal reasons would be a relaxed student. They can play games, call a friend who is away, or call their parents for something they forgot. It may also stop the them from being disruptive in class by texting. With this personal time though, some one may decide to spread some rumors. So, students should try to control themselves before they take it too far and lose this privilege. There may be a situation where something bad happens at school.

Once in a while an emergency happens at school, but what if the power goes out and the phone lines are down? Students could use their phones to call someone to pick them up. Everything would be organized and everybody would get out safe and sound. Some people may freak out, but I'm sure we're mature enough to handle it. Students tend not to study for a test.

Being allowed to use your free time should include studying right? So student should be allowed to type in formation on their phones for a test coming up. This would help pic up test scores and grades in classes, so teachers couldn't complain. If a student needs a",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

As i student i feel that, we the students should be able to use our cell phones during our free time. I bealive in this because , its not harming anything or anyone , most kids have them and use them during school hours anyway , and its modern day so there should be rules that are considering our wants. I also feel that if we got to use our cell phones during free time, cell phones would be less of a distraction in class . Simply because we've already got to use them at some point of the day.

I feel that the rule , ""we can't use cell phones during school hours"" is sometimes reasonable . But at other times its not because i always see teachers using their phones. So why can't we? Its not fair even though we came to school to learn we also have the rights to socialize. I think that's one of the most important things you can learn now. Social skills is very important in , job interviews , college interviews, and in meeting new people .

Maybe if we had more interesting subjects we would be less worried our phones or less tempted to use them. I know that's a big part of why i use my phone during school hours, because our subjects aren't fun enough . Even though we're becoming young adults i still bealive that we should stay young as long as possible . And what better way to that then having fun in school because that's like our second home.

We should all work together as one . The school system should work with the students and the students should work with the school system . Lets start by allowing cell phones and having funnier subjects . And return we ""the students"" will pay more attention in class and become more involved .",3,Cell phones at school,Independent

I know that cell phones cause problems in schools because kids use them in class. Sometimes they have to text their parents if they are sick or something but sometimes it's just for the fun of it. I do think it is a problem and it causes a lot of distraction, not only for the person using it, but the people around them and the teacher also. I just don't think you should make a rule saying we can't have them.

One reason is because if a child is picked up every day and they need to know who is picking them up, they would have no way of knowing at the time. Also, if you are a bus rider, your parents might want to know if you are on the bus and made it home. Those reasons concern parents too, not just the students. Another reason i think cell phones shouldn't be banned is because if you say a student can't have it, some people take it the wrong way and they just want to go against it. Some of the kids i know would just bring it to school anyways just to do what they said not to. There are really a lot of kids like that. I personally don't use my phone at school because i don't want it to get taken up. I just use it after school because I'm a car rider, but i still don't want a no cell phone policy.

I don't think it would make things any better, and students would probably just be offended by it. If phones were allowed to be used on our off periods and at lunchtime, i think it would make students less likely to use them all day long. You see, if we get some privileges, i think it would be good enough and we could hold out on breaking the rules. There would most likely be a lot less kids using phones in class if we could use them some time of the day. So i say you should go with the first policy! These are all plenty of reasons why i think the first policy would be better. I'm not just saying this to get my way or anyone else's for that matter, but because i honestly think it would solve the cell phone problem better than policy two, the no cell phone policy would. I really hope you think it over and take my suggestion as some extra help. Thank you for reading!",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
AA7F9D6FABE3,"Yes i believe students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school. most students need to talk to there parents some time threw out the day while there at school because most play sports and need to see if they have a ride. I also believe that they should let students because if they say you are allowed then they probably will not get it out as often because they wouldn't be as tempting. It may even help with the problems they have to try to work out with the teacher about finding a ride or wonting to ride home with some one else such as a friend. iv often had problems were i didn't know who to ride home with or what to do and it forced me to sneak out my phone and text my parents because 98 percent out of the time the teacher teals you to wait till your next class but that teacher says the same thing. It really isn't that big of a problem at our school, not many of the students have phones or cant afford. Another reason is because when you are on break or at lunch you have a lot of free time and usually nothing to do, but with that rule changed they could play games on there phones or show other students pictures they have taken, I also see why the rule is no phones. im sure there will be some students try to say there phone got stolen or they lost it or some one broke it and stuff but that stuff doesn't happen often if you are acting mature.

F3C4A0CF4AC8,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I would like to discuss with you the new cell phone policy you are thinking of making for this school. I think you should let us use our phones during lunch and free time because we could then get in touch with our parents if we had to. Another reason is that if we needed the homework for something we could then contact a friend. The last reason is because this would give us something to do during x-block or lunch if we don't have anything to do. I would like you to please read my letter to consider the idea.

Cell phones should be allowed at lunch and free times because if our parents needed to contact us for an important reason then we would be able to. For example if one of our family members got injured and we couldn't use our phones then how would we know that. Or if your parents couldn't be home for you after school and you had to go to a neighbor's house you wouldn't know. Having phones available to be used during lunch and free times could definitely benefit communication with our family's for important reasons.

Just say you forget your homework for Spanish and you know a friend in another home room has the same teacher as you, instead of getting up and walking their you could text him an ask for the homework. I think that this could improve the percentage of completed homework assignments. I know that I sometimes forget to write down my home work in my planner so if I could text someone to find out what it was I could get it done. I know that your probably thinking you can do that after school, but if you have many activities like me you will be really busy, and might forget to ask.

My final reason is that sometimes you have no home work and just sit around during x-block and talk. Some teachers don't like when you talk and get mad. If we could use our phones then we could talk to each other, but it would be quiet, so the teachers can't hear any noise. I'm not saying it would be one hundred percent quiet, but it would definitely make a difference. Having phones at x-block could definitely keep kids busy and maybe even out of trouble.

I conclusion having phones could really impact our school in many ways. It could keep family's closer if they are needed and maybe even help kids get homework if they forget it. This could maybe help bring up the percentage of homework assignments completed. This could also keep kids busy if they have nothing to do at x-block. Keeping kids busy at x-block could even lead to less kids getting in trouble. Thank you for reading this and I hope you considered my reason.

I am writing this letter to support mine, and others' choices to allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them whenever free time is available. Such as lunch time, you don't have to work on anything, or pay attention, it's your own free time. I think it is the perfect opportunity to use your cell phone.

Another great opportunity to use your phone would be between class periods. Let's say, that your mother is coming to pick you up early from school, but doesn't know where the front office is or where to sign you out. That is when you would call or text your mother and tell her where the front office is and where to sign you out.

Finally, a great opportunity to use your cell phone would be when you have advisory. Every single day in advisory, all we do is read or do worksheets, but what about when we are done with those books or worksheets. That would be the perfect time to use your cell phone. If you have an emergency, if you feel sick, if you have a broken bone, anything. Even though the nurse is there, sometimes she doesn't let you go home. Therefore, as a backup plan you could use your cell phone to contact your parent or guardian. I hope you take into consideration, my choice to allow students to use their cell phones during time that is available. Thank you for your time.

40AB9AF60E36,"Dear mrs. Principal,

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME and I am writing on behalf of the cell-phone policy. I think cell phones during passing periods would be great because if a student needs to talk to someone on the other side of campus while walking to class, a cell phone would be a perfect device for such a problem. I also agree that they be turned off during class. Not only a great idea, but a way to keep students interested in school.

Having only 45 minutes of class and 8 periods a day with 3 minute intervals is plenty of time for someone to get where they need and enough time to talk to someone quickly on their cell phones, or during lunch. If a student's mother needed to talk to him/her they could easily call during lunch time. Or any relative or friends. They could inform the student about family troubles or if they were coming to pick them up later on, for a doctor's appointment. I think that only 8th grade and up should be allowed this perk because 7th grade and below wouldn't pay attention where they are walking or pay attention to someone administrative walking into them by accident. Then the cell-phone policy would become too strict and if someone needed to call their mother about a family emergency they would not be able to. just because some isn't walking in the right way could harm the whole grades chances of being able to get this treat.

If someone were to spoil the chances of this treat for everyone else then i think there should be single punishments for offenses from certain students. If a student has a repeat offense then they should be punished by themselves. If someone were to mess up for the first time then they shouldn't be punished unless it was serious, but also speaking, what if administrators were to run into a student, they should be punished, by a $15 fine just as well as anyone else, including students. I think that cell-phone usage at passing periods and lunch time would improve student morality about school.

I am writing this letter because of the new cell phone police decisions. First off i want to say each choice is very different from the other. To not allow cell phones at school is pretty harsh and we students have a right to have them as long as they don't disrupt class. So i am asking you to please consider ruling in favor of policy one. First it would allow student to contact parents about important information that they learned during school so they don't forget. Second there would be less temptation during to use them during class. Thirdly when there is less disruption we will be better able to study when are temptation for cell phones is gone.

You may be think well that's good and all but i could just ban cell phones and all those problems would go away. Well if you did there would be mass anger towards you and there would be more and more breaking of the rules more detentions and there would be even more using of cell phones when in class.

So in the conclusion of my letter i thank you for taking your time to read it and i know you will make the right decision for all of us.

Because it would be nice to chat to anther friends that go to a deferent school, and it would be cool to chat to other friends on the web from your phone.

First we should be aloud time to use our sell phones to chat to friends at another school because who doesn't like to talk/ text there best friend! I know that i would love to talk to my friend that goes to a different school.

The other reason it would be nice to be able to use our sell phones is that it would be cool if we could use our phones and the time given to use them to do research.

we could have homework that requires us to do research on the computer but if we have a phone that has the internet, why wait till your home to get it done?

I think we should be aloud to use cell phones during free periods. Technology is part of the future and we will use it when we are older. It will help us become adults. We can also keep up with our friends and our parents can call to tell us if there is a problem. Kids already use them.

But the cell phones should be shut off during class to stop distractions. We all need to face it we will all be using technology in the future. Most of our jobs will require a computer or cell phone. Why not let us express our freedom. If you tell them they cant use there cell phones they will want to use them and if you tell them they can they will think your cool and wont argue with you as much.

Another reason cell phones should be shut off during class is because the kids could text each other the answers. Let us express our freedom. If teachers can use them let us so we our all equal, and we don't look down on each other. I agree There has to be rules but we also should be aloud freedom. If we couldn't have phones at school how are we supposed to call our parents to come and pick us up. Or if school gets canceled how are we supposed to call them.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
F0B2E946A04C,"I understand that there is an issue with cell phone during school hours. But I believe this issue is never going to go away unless we work our way around it. We are now in the twentieth century, technology is a big thing, especially to us teenagers. I believe that is a great idea to allow students to bring their cell phones to school and use them during our lunch periods and other free times, as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time.

I can understand why you wouldn't want to have cell phones during school hours. Some people might say it's a distraction, having students using their phones in class or their cell phones to go off during a lecture. Or some people just don't want students to have cell phones at all. But I say we should but the cell phones to good use.

Almost everybody has a cell phone, is one of the biggest technology used everyday. But I think we can do better then just using cell phones during free time and during lunch. I believe that we should use them in class. If we use projectors, computers, and other technical devices why not cell phones? Most cell phones have calculators, let you take notes, and much more. A student always have their cell phone with them, so they could study more frequently. You can't carry a notebook around all the time like you do a cell phone. You could also record a lesson and watch it or listen to it when you don't understand, sometimes just reading and going over notes isn't enough. Less people would be getting in trouble if cell phones weren't an issue. Of course there are going to be times when a child is caught not following the rules, but everyone messes up were only human. Teenagers are always going to be tempted to break the rules. If you tell them they can't use their cell phones, they are going to be tempted to do it, and some people will.

Not allowing students to have cell phones would very much upset them. Most schools make the students put their cell phones in their locker. But most of them won't, if they put their cell phone in their locker they are most likely going to forget it and leave it at school. Which would lead to more problems. Most people are very dependent to their cell phones. So telling them that can't have it will not work. Students will always have their cells phones so why not work around it and maybe use them?

But if you can't use them during class perhaps just allowing students to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times is a wonderful idea. it's nice to just have fun at school every once in awhile, especially if your cramped up in a classroom for several hours. We are young adults I believe we can handle it. I hope you take what I said into deep consideration and allow us to use our cell phones.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
D248655EAA45,"Riiiiing! Riiiiing! Like a teacher's cell phone has never gone off in class! I think that if teachers are allowed to have cell phones in school, students should be able to too. Eliminating the nuisance by having a no cell phones in school policy would just cause a bigger problem. Parents might get angry because they do not have the ability to reach their children after school since they couldn't take their cell phones to school. Also, more students would get in trouble because they brought their cellular devices to school and since its not allowed, got it confiscated. Students would get themselves landed in detention , so clearly, there's just going to be a bigger problem when kids can't bring their cell phones to school.

If students can bring their cell phones to school, but not use them in class, it's their fault if they get in trouble. Cell phones should be allowed in school to avoid a lot of controversy.

In TV shows, the teachers always hate doing detention don't they? They have to base it off of something, so wouldn't that be based off of real life? Taking cell phones away would just make more kids go to detention. Instead of only having to do it one or two times a week, it would be everyday. That would also make parents angry because maybe they told their students that they needed to take their cell phone because they had to have a way to be contacted after school. But, some mean teachers don't take excuses from parents or kids which can make people outraged.

If the principle went with Policy 2, I'm almost positive that there would be a court case about it. You can't just not listen to the parents, they are the ones that pay for the school. Shouldn't they make the decisions here? Parents would be mad because not only do they buy their kids cell phones for safety, but now that their kids would not have them, they're A students would be getting in trouble a lot more often and the teachers aren't going to listen to the parents that it's their fault. It's important for students to have cell phones at least at lunch and other free times than not at all.

Cell phone usage in school is a great idea, i think that you should only allow us to use our cell phones in certain areas such as the hallways, bathrooms, lunch, and free periods. Giving us the ability to use our cell phones in school gives us the freedom that we deserve as a teenager, and it is also a good start for us to learn how to do things on our own, and learning the consequences of different things because without the usage of freedom we feel as if we don't have the ability to do anything at all, and by using our phone in class will teach us to ignore the phone and pay more attention to the teacher. And the point of a cell phone is to have the chance to be able to talk to friends and stay in touch with our family members an also if there is an emergency as well. Say if we had a lockdown in our school because there was a robber in the school and our parents didn't know what is going on they would want us to call them or at least text them to tell them that we are okay and we are safe in a room.

The usages of cell phones in classes however would not be good. because kids can use them to cheat on tests with each other, text during class and not being able to pay attention to what is being taught. Overall i think that students should only be allowed to use cell phones during free periods and not academic classes because in certain classes we are there to learn and not to fool around and use our cell phones. Certain times during the day it should be okay to use a cell phone but some parts you also have to buckle down and do what you have to do in order to succeed in life!!

When kids think of using there cell phones in school and that they have the ability to use cell phones, everybody doesn't think of what could happen to them. They could get lost or break, Damaged, or even taken away. If i had the ability to use my cell phone in school i would be so happy and excited because now i am able to do anything with it without getting caught and having it taken away from me. But then again i would also have to think about all the risks of taking my cell phone to school as well. And i also have to watch where and what time i take it out because during my main classes i would either put it on vibrate or silent because i would want to have the ability to learn something and not be on my cell phone all the time like all the other kids would be doing .

I know that you have considered two policies regarding the cell phones and the students. And I know it must be a tough decision considering the emergency's that happen in the everyday life. It will either let the students have their cell phones during school and turned off or not bringing one at all. Well I think that the best policy will be letting us bring a cell phone and turning it off during class but letting us use it during lunch hours or other free times.

Now i know you must be thinking that this is a terrible idea but if you really think about it, it all makes a lot of sense. Just imagine that all of a sudden there's a big lockdown and none of the teachers have access a phone but luckily, a student has a cell phone and is able to contact the police. Wouldn't that be a life saver?

Cell phones are very useful in a lot of scenarios.

Now i know you thinking 'What about during class? Would students secretly want to use their cell phones to text their other classmates?' Of course some students will try to do this but that is why teachers need to be very attentive to their students and what they are doing. If a student gets caught using a cell phone, the teacher takes it away and a parent has to come pick it up. If the parent doesn't come, then there will be a phone call home explaining why the cell phone was taken away from the student. I hope you do consider my request about the cell phones and why we should keep them in school I think it will be very useful in most occasions for everyone.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
4141D61871DE,"I think policy 1 should be allowed because they can us there phones but during class everyone is fine without texting or whatever there doing. If we didn't have phones at our school there would be nothing else to do at lunch or when you have free time to do what you want to do. But if they get caught with it out during class then they would have to play a fee to get it back. Also if we could use it all day no one would pay attention in class they would be on there phone all day but we should be able to use them most of the day. An plus if we did have our phones out all day people would be cheating on test an texting friends in other classes an distracting them from what there doing, but that's why we shouldn't have them out all the time just sometimes like lunch and in the hallways, but if like someone's mom calls we should be able to awnser it in case if its an emergency.

I think that policy 2 is kind of over board because now days people cant stand not being without there phones so its like our baby's to us. if we didn't have them today our technology wouldn't be like it is today, but as i was saying we should be able to have our phones because its all us kids do is play on our phones an we have nothing else to do.

Some of the students here believe that we, the school, should be able to use our cell phones in our free time. But, other students oppose, they feel they do not need to use their cell phones at all. I for one hold the belief that cell phones should only be used during break, lunch, after school, etc. People should be able to use the phones during these time and these times alone.

For example if someone had taken a fall and broken their arm, leg, etc. and nobody was around to help them, if the schools policy was that they must not have their phone during school then they would have no contact to anyone that may be able to help them. The phones are sometimes a must have. Since the phones are to be off during class time the people who feel the need of having no interruption whatsoever may have their quiet, and everyone is happy. the people who want their quiet and the people who feel the need to socialize.

Now, the teachers will also be happy too. the Students have already socialized enough at break, so they should probably be more silent. The teachers can finally teach in peace the end result is a win for everyone. No one feels their expectation for quiet or socialization unmet.

Many kids can get distracted by cell phones. The phones sometimes go off in class because a student does not turn the phone off or they forget to turn the phone off and the class gets disrupted. The cells phones will also cause students to get distracted from what they were suppose to do and then will get in trouble. The students will suffer consequences that could have been avoided if the cell phones were not allowed. Cell phones should not be allowed in school for these reasons.

Sometimes students will have their phones in their backpacks when it suddenly goes off. This disrupts the class because they will lose their attention to the teacher and look back to the student who owns the phone. It also might cause the teacher to forget what they were teaching because of the sudden disruption. The other students will get disrupted and not pay attention to the teacher and then they will not know what the teacher said. This would cause the student consequences and may get in trouble or not know some answers on a test.

Not only do cell phones disrupt class and students, but they also distract students from what they are doing. The students might be sent on an errand by a teacher and might start trying to text. The student might forget what they were suppose to do and get in trouble. If a student needed to quickly study last minute for a test and they receive texts then the student will get distracted. This might cause the student to not study and then get a bad grade or not do as well as they could have on the test.

Schools should not allow cell phones because the phones disrupt and distract kids. Students sometimes forget to turn the phone off when it goes off in class and the class will be disrupted. Other times students may need to do some quick last minute things when they get texts and then do not do what they needed to do. These reasons are why some students may get in more trouble because of their or someone else's phone. Cells should not be in school to avoid some consequences that the students might face for disrupting a class or getting distracted by their phone.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

I think that we should be able to use cell phones during lunch and free time because of emergency situations.

If a student forgets something like homework or other school related things they should be able to use there own phone to call and let their parents know that they forgot something and need them to bring it into school for them.

Another reason is if they are in any kind of after school activity and times or plans change or they need a ride home they can use their phone during a free period to let them know what is going on.

If they do that they do not have to waste class time worrying if their parents know and using the school phone.

Also, if there is a family emergency then the student's parents can get a hold of them faster to let them know what is going on.

This could be faster than calling the school.

This is also a good idea if a student has health issues they can let their parents know what is wrong with them and if they should be sent home by the nurse.

Plus, the nurse may not know what to do in a certain situation so they could talk to the parents on the student's cell phone.

My last reason is communication if we do not communicate with our fellow students then we don't know what is going on in other classes.

We may have a test that is hard and we can remind others to study.

That is why we should be able to use cell phones during lunch and free time.

If these reasons are not good enough you should still give the students a change.

Make it clear that they should have them off before entering a class where they should not be on.

Give punishments and rules of what they can and cannot do with the phones.

It think you should allow policy number one. It think you should allow policy one, because students get bored in recess, they use it to have a social life in school, and they can use it on their free time just in case there is an emergency. Some students like to use their phones in recess, so they will stay out of trouble and be calm. Also a phone is used to be socialized in school, to the drama, fights, and other stuff updated. The phone is used also in case of emergency's, like if you where to ripe your pants or something like that would you like to walk all the way to the office just to call home.

See this is why i think you should let policy one happen. at other school's students have no problem with this policy as long as students use it for accurate things. I know you don't want to bring this policy back, because sometimes students use them during their learning time, to record fights in classrooms, and to text their friends when there like right next to each other. If you can trust us this one time we promise you that we will won't take advantage of this privilege.

D150E09CBC2E,"Policy number two

I believe that kids should not be able to use cell phones at school at all. Which would be policy two stating this. Policy two states that kids aren't allowed to have there cell phones at school at all.

The kids can use their cell phone after school but not anytime during the school hours . Policy one states that kids cant use their phones in class but can use them during lunch hours. Still i don't go with policy one because kids can easily text answers back and forth. Its as easy as the kids remembering the test or quiz questions and asking him or her about it and then going back in class and getting it right. That is no fair, that is just cheating.

Also, i believe policy number one is wrong because maybe there is some kids at school who don't have phones. Then the people with phones will make fun of the kids without phones. This is just bullying. Policy number one can lead into violence and many types of bullying. Some things or examples of things that could happen during policy one would be like a kids taking pictures and sending them all over the school and just making kids feel bad.

Policy number one is definitely wrong. I believe that policy number two is good because all the nonsense kids do on their cell phones can happen after school. It doesn't need to be around the school environment. Policy two i think will make many students mad, yes. But is it always happy times? No, school inst suppose to be for fun. It for learning or the education that matters. The cell phones being allowed is going to bring down the learning instead of helping it out and making it better.

Another way policy two is better is kid cud easily tell someone to come pick them up and take them home so they can miss out on a quiz or a test or even just school work. This is just wrong. Kids should not be able to do this.

Kids these days i see them always texting . Texting is there life it really is i walk my dogs around outside sometimes and you see kids hanging with there friends TEXTING. All the time i see kid texting It wrong, i bet those kids who were texting and having a good time have a ton of homework that not even close to being finished and instead of that they are out hanging and having fun. That's what kids like to do and is FUN.

The reason i bet that policy number one was even mentioned was probably because kids love their phone so much they want to bring them to school and have fun. Well to those kids they can go home and have fun but when they go to school its time to be serious and get the work done.

I strongly suggest that policy number two is done. Its best for everyone and the school. Kids don't need cell phones in school. Its just not good, its wrong. Kids need be responsible and grow up and learn that cell phones are not the whole world.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
E0536CFB1530,"I think the principal should go with policy 2. I guess it's okay to have them during free time or lunch periods, but eventually, it'll be their main priority. It'll probably start off okay, but when your texting someone, you tend to make the conversation longer. Let's say one of your best friends was telling you a secret about someone else. They'd text and text, and it be almost impossible to stop because you have so much you want to cover. Then they might sneak it under a table or hide it in a book as if they're reading. Well instead of listening to your teacher the whole time and not studying, you've been texting, which could affect your grades for all the time you've lost. Staying focus and putting your mind to what really matters gets you far in life, not texting.

People may use some excuses like if they're was an emergency. The school does have a phone, doesn't it? Why not use those instead. They become so obsessed with them sometimes that they become idols and we forget what's really important. If texting gets out of hand instead of working, people could fail high school, or their grades will keep them from getting into the college that they want to go to. Just save all the texting for the end of the day so that you can get done was has to get done. Procrastinating will put you in a big whole, and you'll look back and see where you messed up, maybe hoping that you had put your priorities first. By then, it'll be too late.

793800C02EE3,"Dear Principal,

I think that Policy 1 is very suitable for our school. There are many reasons why you should go with policy 1 instead of policy 2. I will give you three prime examples why. One reason you should go with policy 1 is, letting us do this will show our responsibility. Another reason is, it shows that you trust us. Lastly, this shows that you are willing to give us some freedom.

As i have stated previously, Policy 1 lets students show how responsible they can be. As students show responsibility it encourages maturity. Maturity is key for any student as they age. Being mature helps students think that they are getting older and can do more. This may lead to a decrease in student related school conflicts.

Showing students that you trust them is key in staff-student relationships. Trusting students also shows that you are willing to help them and get to know them. As students begin to feel trusted they grow to like their staff more. The more they like their staff the less likely they are to get into an argument with them. Students also trust someone more when they know they are being trusted.

Lastly, giving us some freedom will greatly help students with social interactions. School is supposed to be a place where students have time to grow and be free from pressure that they may have at home. Giving a student freedom (to an extent)

will show how the staff cares about them. It's key to give students a little freedom to show that you trust them. Students like me think that school is just another form of prison that its filled with more people to unfairly boss you around. Giving them freedom will show that this is a place for them to enjoy learning.

As you can see there are many reasons for you to go with policy one instead of policy 2. Whether it be to show responsibility. Or possibly to show trust. Maybe to show the students you want them to have some freedom. Policy 1 is obviously the better choice.

Your student",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
B528C5E19433,"To Whom it May Concern:

I was just notified that our school principal is reconsidering the cell phone policy.

Policy one is that students can use their cell phones during lunch period and during free times, policy 2 is no cell phones at all. She needs to know which policy is going to be within her best interest.

I personally think that we should go with policy 1. I think that policy one is a better choice because a lot of students like to text during class, and they like to text or use their cell phones on a regular basis. On their regular basis they basically text whenever they hear or feel their phones vibrate or ring. So while the teacher turns their back the students might be texting. I also know that if the principal chose the policy one then the students would do their work and pay attention so they can have free time and text their friends. But also if the principal just does policy 1, then the students wont have to talk or text on their phone when the teacher turns their back and they can get a lot of their work done.

I remember when i was in seventh grade, which was last year i had a teacher named TEACHER_NAME. TEACHER_NAME

didn't care what you did whether it was texting or doing homework. She didn't have any structure to where you would know that you had to get all of your work done before you could text. So that is why so many kids passed her class even though they didn't do the work because she would let you sit there and accomplish nothing. She couldn't fail you if she barely ever gave you work. So then when she actually decided to put her foot down nobody listened at first. But then she made up the rule that if you were passing and you did all of your work for that day then you could do whatever you wanted and that lit up a light bulb in my head to start doing my work.

Another thing that our school would have is better attendance. Some parents don't care whether their child goes to school or not. So some students would have to stand in the gap if their parent wont. But if a student actually wants to go to school then maybe that will influence their parents that they need to change. But if a child wants to go to school because they know that if they do then they can do whatever and more then they were going to do at home. So if the principal chose policy 1 then they would have better attendance.

So i think if our school principal decided to go with policy 1 then we would have a lot of structured kids, a better grade point average, and we would have a lot of more kids that actually want to go to school. That is why i want our principal to choice policy and why.      ",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
6D50C3075ED7,"Dear principle, work, work, work, you say you want us to try our best on projects but it is had without phones. There are clubs and plenty of other things to do after school. Without a phone if a club meeting is canceled we can still get a ride home. I think it would be sensible to let us bring phones to school.

A lot of kids are in clubs, if the club meeting is canceled then how are we going to get a ride home; the solution to that is to let us bring phones to school. If we can't bring phones to school then a lot of parents wouldn't let kids join after school clubs. You say that you don't want kids on the street, so if we have a phone we can join after school clubs, and not be on the street.

So without phones we can't join after school clubs. I learned that phones can be a problem, but can also help us out a lot to. So that is why phones should be aloud. So I believe that it would be in the best interest of us to let us have phones at school.

95619672F4CB,"Dear Principal,

I believe that changing the schools cell phone policy so we can have our phones out during lunch and other free periods is a very smart and wise idea. The reason why i believe so strongly in this reason is because students all ready use their phones during class, lunch, hallways, and other areas around the school. But if you instil this change of policy the chances are there would be less students texting or using there phones in class because they all ready have a time in the day to use their phones without getting in trouble. But if you do pass the policy in which we are not aloud to phones in the school building, the chances are that students will still bring them, still play with them, and will still definitely text with them in class. However if you pass the policy where we are aloud to bring them and use them in our free time then there will be a lot less students getting in trouble for texting on their phones. Phones can be distracting but they aren't going to go away and with time they are going to become more and more popular. So i feel it's better to embrace it rather then just to push it away and pretend that, that rectangle in our pocket isn't our phones because i can ensure you that it probably is.

F8CDAD03758D,"Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I feel that we the students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school. Some students need cell phones because their parents need to know when they get out of school. Parents pick up their children from school when they leave. Suppose that a student has to suddenly stay late for basketball practice. If the student doesn't have a cell phone, when the parent comes when they usually do, the student won't be there to be picked up. Thus, resulting in the student not having a ride home.

Students should be able to use their phones during free time. Now with all the social network sites like Facebook and Twitter, students want to be able to be updated on what's going on. Also students like to surf the web and go on Youtube and do other enjoyable things. The students would get a chance to text or email other friends that may not be at the same school. I feel that it will give the students, like myself , a sense of independence being able to use phones.

Now I know why you may want students to not use phones. Students can cheat on tests by looking online or texting. Also you don't want students to text during class and other times when they shouldn't. That's why after lunch and free times you should do a cell phone check to see if the students turn off their phones. If you were to find at least 50 phones on, then you can take cell phone days away for a week. To me that sounds like a fair exchange.

All in all I hope you decide to go with policy 1. It is a better and more fair choice for the student body. Please take this letter in consideration. Thank you.

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME

I'm writing you this letter to let you know that I and other students believe that policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, should be the new rule or at least try it for a week or two and see how well it works. If it doesn't work that well then don't make it a permanent rule, but if it does go well then you should make it a permanent rule.

I think that being able to use your phone during lunch periods or other free time would be great, because it is so boring for students when all they could do when they are done with everything is sit there. We already have problems with students texting in class, I'm sure if you made policy 1 a rule we would have an outrageous amount of problems lowered.

I am a student at you school and I have had some concerns on the phone policy. I have some ideas and suggestions on things that can be added or changed to the policy.

I think that all students should be able to carry their phones, but only in lunch, study halls, ands in hall ways. I think that if any student is caught with their phones in class they should get their phones taken away for the rest of the day. The students should get their phones back at the end of the day. Another thing is if they are caught three time the student should get a detention. I think that if you enforce those rules there will be less texting in class, less cheating, and it may raise grades because of the increase attention in class.

There are many reasons why the students need their phones. some of the students have their parents working and can not communicate with anyone in case of emergency , others have after school activity, others also have to call their parents to pick them up.

Many people will suggest to have the students go to the office to call their parents. That will only lead to packed offices. There may also be emergency that restrict people of getting out of the office.

There are lots of reasons why you may want the students not to have their phones but my opinion is that the reasons why they should have their phones out way the other reasons.

""Ring, Ring, Ring""

The teachers looks at the student. The student goes and takes her phone out of her bag and starts texting in her class. i believe the students should not be allowed to use their phones in free time. If they use their phones they will disturb their class mates, they will not focus on their work and they will not pass to the other grade.

To begin with, i believe that students should not have phones on campus because they will disturb everybody that wants to learn. What if the phone ringed in the middle of your class and the girl or boy goes and picks up the phone. When he or she douse that the student will start talking really loud and giggling. It will cause the other students to not concentrate and fail their test. The sad thing about it is that the teacher cant do everything because he or she has done the test and has nothing to do.

Together with disturbing the class there is also that the student will not focus on their work. They will be to busy texting on their phones that they will not get to focus on the school work. They will not do their home work and will not pass the FCAT at the end of the school year. The teacher will give them work to do but they will not learn how to do it because they did not pay attention. They will have bad grades in all their classes and even drop out of the school they are in.

Last but not least the student will not be able to pass to the other grade level. With no work done and with little learning they will not pass the big test the FCAT.

""Hey STUDENT_NAME I'm texting STUDENT_NAME. Anyway what are we learning about?"" Many students would text during class and not pay attention to their teachers or in class. I believe that most students will not be able to control themselves with this much freedom. I believe that students shouldn't be allowed to bring cell phones to school.

Many kids in school with text in class and not pay attention. So man kids would be want to text in class and they will. Then when the teachers asks them to answer a question they wouldn't know the answer since they weren't paying attention. These kids were too busy texting their friend across the room or where every their friend is. Another reason is that some kids never payed attention that they start failing their classes for not passing their tests or for not participating in class. Their grades will start going down and it affects them dearly such as going to summer school or even repeating the grade. Not only that but these kids would distract other kids from their education. For instance, one kid may text to another kid, and that kid might start texting back to who ever text him. Next thing you know, is that those two kids just lost one day of their education and is now having trouble with that subject the rest of the year. Cell phones in school is a distraction for kids.

I truly believe that students wouldn't have any control what so ever if they have cell phones in school. They would get distractive and distract other kids from their education.

When all that happens the first thing they will do is run to the administration or to the principals. Then parents will get involved.

When you are in class in your phone is on and one of your friends text you , you are going to stop what you are doing just to look at that text message you are taking your mind off of the lesson in class. Phones can also be a detraction to others, if you forgot to put your phone on vibrate and the ringer go off in class the teacher would have to stop the class and take up your phone and the students will be looking at you. Phones can get you in a lot of trouble like taking a serious test and if you get caught with it you can fail or be retained in that same grade, phones should be banned or taking up for the school hours. Most students be to concern about their phone that they'll fail , and phones can also start a lot of trouble you can start a rumor at school about someone just by sending a text message to one of your friends.

I have heard that you're reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. This maybe my opinion but I think many other children agree. I think you should accept policy number one. Cell phones are a very important part of the new world that we live in today. Cell phones should be allowed because they can be used to call for emergencies, parents feel more secure if they can contact their children anytime, and because not everyone has friends that are particularly in the school that they're in.

To start off, cell phones are one of the most important things to have if you're in an emergency. It's very uncommon to be in an emergency at school ,but I would prefer to have my cell phone just incase. We can have bus accidents, be in a fight , leave your house keys at home, need new clothes if you uhh... have an accident. There are all sorts of reasons! Expect the unexpected is what they might say. Emergencies are a very common reason; I know. The reason why it's usually repeated is because it's important! As principal, you must always think of the children's safety.

Continuing, parents feel a lot more secure if they can talk to their children anytime. If you have a daughter or son, you should know the feeling. Parents always ask their children to bring their cell phones with them when they're out with friends, at a relative's house, or even at home! They want to know that you're safe everywhere you go. It's a parent thing, I suppose. Also, cell phones have a contact book that saves everyone's phone number that's registered. You can't believe how many people I know that don't even know their parent's or house number! I read in a book that there has been an accident in South America that made parents uproar about cell phones in school. Now that wouldn't be pleasant, now would it?

Finally, not everyone has friends that they can see in school. They can even be in different periods than them. As a teenager, we always worry about our social life as well as academics. I have often heard from kids that they love going to school just for their friends. Some people aren't part of the 'in crowd'. The people who are, however , can talk all they want if it's during free time. I don't see any harm in that.

The policy that I think is better for the cell phones is the first because we could use the phone to ask question like in my case I forget thing and i could ask one of my friend to help me with the homework and if there a problem i could call the police and during class is good idea to turn them off because at some point phones are going to distract students from learning the subject or to study for a test and if you don't have a computer you could use your phone like for an example my phone I have the iphone 4g I don't have computer but i could go on the internet and search what my question is a video to show me how to do my projects. Maybe you left your lunch home grab your phone call your parents if they can they could bring your lunch.

the first policy i believe is better because many students like phone and want to call to have a little freedom to call someone a friend and i now that they could get distracted in calling everyone but that could be good way of communication to help out, to be in touch with your study group. maybe they had an accident in the school and no one has your parents number and your the only one.

I think that if you kids use there phones in school the will more then likely cheat on a quiz or a test. I have herd of kids from different schools who have been able to bring there phones to class. Of course they over used it and cheated on homework and the where getting on the internet and looking up bad things and more kids were becoming bad. The teachers were just done dealing with all the kids who were cheating on test and texting in class. I also think that if we could bring our phones to class that it would be good for some kids because then we could text our parents and tell them we need lunch money, homework, backpacks, and anything we left at home. Today i know kids in our school that text and call people during school hours, i' m not going to say any names but kids do it all the time and personally, knowing all the kids i know, they will completely over abuse this if we allow it at SCHOOL_NAME.

I am still going to go with Policy 1 because I use my cell phone in the hall or at my locker sometimes. My cell phone is always in my pocket turned off i call my mom or dad to ask if they can bring me up my lunch money or homework. If you let kids bring there phones to school, and they promise to use them in a needing time. I have fear that some one will break in to the school and/or the school will catch on fire so I always keep my phone in my pocket and i have the police on my quick dial on my phone. I would hate for someone to break in and no one is able to call 911 so i think they should allow kids to bring there phones to school.

But what makes me really mad is when teachers say ""Ok kids put your phones away and spit out your gum and no drinks in class."" and they are sitting in the front of the room texting and drink diet soda and chomping on some bubble gum. That is just one thing that grinds my gears. they are so hypocritical sometimes.

7E365E9933BA,"I have two different opinions on cell phones during school. To preface them, I want to begin with saying that cell phone usage, as a whole, is of little importance. Teachers seem to be reluctant to enforce the current policies we have, as cell phones do not distract most students, especially if set to vibrate and not ring. And most students have enough control to not use them during a time of importance, like when taking a test. And no student will ever give up their usage of cell phones during class, so long there is a way to use them during class, even if it's against rules.

Both policies have their merit, but I believe Policy 1 would provoke less outrage from students. Not all students have free time at the same time as others. For example, when I'm in my lunch period, which is period 5, somebody else may be in their math class. This matters because I can possibly interrupt his thought during an assignment. Also, students will not turn their phones off unless punishment is severe, and teachers are actively looking out for students using cell phones. Policy 2 would also be fine, with the exception that students will probably be annoyed with the principal, or the Board of Education, or whoever promotes and declares this new policy. To work, Policy 2 would also have to be enforced well. However, students would likely resent Policy 2 more. It's restricting, especially when it pops into place so suddenly. Sudden, harsh change isn't favored by anybody. Even parents may be involved with making Policy 2 controversial within the town, as some feel the need to keep in touch with their child during school, especially after certain security issues happening at them, such as pipe bombs, smoke bombs, and guns being brought and used at some schools throughout the country.

Policy 1 is the better policy, but in the greater picture, a problem posed by something so miniscule as a cell phone doesn't matter. Thus, I'm indifferent to anything regarding cell phones. I do admit to using mine sometimes during class, but I have enough self control to not turn it into a problem. However, if one is to go about changing the policy on cell phones, it'd have to be enforced well to work. This is where the boundaries of teaching and babysitting students blend. If cell phones are that much of a problem to the staff, then teachers likely aren't teaching because they're being told by their superiors to make cell phones a priority. When a teacher is actively looking for people that are using their cell phones during class, chewing gum, not wearing a school ID, etc., they ultimately aren't doing their job, and that is what truly matters.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent

Cell phones in school can also be a good thing also known as a pro. With cell phones allowed in school as long as they are turned off during class time isn't bad, but with the students able too have them they are more than certain to take advantage & use them during class time anyway.

Cell phones in school are a huge distraction. Students would be so into their texts messages or their cell phone calls in the middle of an important lesson instead of listening & taking down notes for their next test. If cell phones are allowed in school, it would be a waist of useful learning time & knowledge being given away. If you are learning how too read, write, or use arithmetic then maybe you could use that knowledge too teach someone else. I believe that it is more important for all eyes & ears too be listening too the teacher, actively participating in class, & working hard to achieve something big then too be texting or on the phone in class or school time period. Most people think that you have too text in class & it is necessary. Well not really because cell phone use in class can lead too lack of knowledge, disrespect too students & teachers, & you being off task and unfocused.

""Oh my your phone is trash, that cheap twenty dollar phone? PLEASEEE! Mines is a 100% better."" Students may argue & bicker about their phones being better than someone else's phone. I can guarantee that if phones were left home & not on school grounds or property then that would decrease the problem of trying to be better then the next person. Cell phones in school can cause many fights & cause terrible violence. But to stop or avoid that cell phones in school should be banned & a legislative state law.

All in all cell phones are a NO! So I am going too say I STRONGLY agree with Policy 2. Cell phones on school period can cause fighting, violence            ",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

Dear Principal,

I am thinking about the policies for using cell phones at school. Since many students are using phones, they will of course want to use it at school. I surely know that all of the students would want Policy One, since it enables them to use their cell phones at break time. That will mean there will be a less amount of phones being taken away during class, because they spent the time using their phones at break. Of course, the students cannot use their phones during class. I would agree with Policy One.

Using cell phones at break would decrease the amount of students using cell phones in class, since they used their break time to use it. That will lead to a decreasing number phones being taken away, and also a decreasing number of referrals and detention.

Letting the students using their cell phone during break and lunch time will lower the chance of fights. It also could make the voice level go down, which will be a relief to the yard duties and other teachers.

I know Policy One will work for the students and staff, because if you don't let the students use their phone, they will try any single way, and use any spare time during classes. That would end up in disaster. All of the students in this school will enjoy the time you will enable them to use their phones, and the school will be a happier place.

7C7D34EB1627,"What i think is better is to have the phones off in class because if it rings or vibrates your going to be distracted and your not going to focus on your work and your going to end up calling your friend and laughing loud and he/she is not going to listen on what the homework assignment is or what they have to do for the class work this is why you have to keep your cell phones off in class. then later this wont happen to you and always be focus in school and focus on your friends later school goes first for you could get a good job. and if they want to decide if they want to have their cell phones on in class is not going to be better for the teachers because they cant help the students learn and what is going on in life and what do they have to do as their assignment. they want to be texting in class and be distracted.

Only one person will always make a difference in life if they do something wrong the other person needs to come in and say that they didn't do that, they didn't text in class he/she was paying attention then later the teacher asks them a question and they don't know the answer to the question and thats when they catch them that they were texting or talking so is better off keeping the phones off or on silent for it won't make any noise and you will be focus in school more and you will get your grades up higher and will never be distracted until you go home and then you could do all the texting you want to do and never have u grades because of the texting if you have it on vibrate ignore it and continue working on your class work or homework .

Since the school's cell phone policy is being reconsidered, i believe students shouldn't be allowed to have phones out while at school.

Many teenagers would disagree with my opinion, but I have many good reasons.

Students wouldn't get as much exercise.

After lunch they would be more focused on texting than interacting with there student body that is face to face with them.

Since we have the privilege of getting to go outside after lunch and talk or play football, basketball etc. many students would be more worried about their phones than getting rid of all there energy that has built up all morning while sitting in a classroom.

I think a lot of students would also take advantage of the privilege by using them during class while a teacher wasn't looking.

Many students do it anyway and phones have to be turned off.

Also i think this would lead to a lot more drama and children getting into trouble.

Someone could text their friend and say something mean about another person but that person would find out they had been talked about at school so the problem would have to be handled at school and not at home.

There would be more verbal abuse that could lead to physical fighting.

From my point of view students would be more interested in checking their phones than going to class or remembering to go by their locker and grab their homework for their next class.

This would lower many grades and may cause students to fail a class or even a grade.

Many students might make it a habit to be tardy or skip class because of this new policy as well.

The school's cell phone policy should not be changed because along with this change their would be many problems that would also occur.

Students can use their cell phones on their own time out of school.

Please consider my reasoning before the policy is finally changed.

I am writing this letter to tell u that kids should bring there phones to school because u never know when there's going to be a emergency. but they shouldn't because it is going to be a distraction to them when they are in class. I don't really have a opinion to it because in both cases there is a good thing about it and a problem to it.

For example what happens if a kid parent had a problem at work and he cant pick him up when school is over how is the dad going to tell his son that he has a problem and that he is not going to pick him up. or maybe that the boy had to stay after school for a program or serve detention how is he going to tell his father that he is going to stay and the father is going to get mad at him because he didn't inform him about what was going to happen after school.

On the other hand having it is going to be a distraction as i said before because many other kids are not going to pay attention. They are going to be on the phone while the teacher was giving the lesson for that day. Not all the kids do that they may find a excuse so that they could message while they where out of class and the teacher thinking that he/she went to the restroom or to pick up something from another class.

As u see there is going to be a problem picking witch one is ok for the school and many are going to agree or disagree. i couldn't pick one as u see but i gave u two reasons why it is good and why it's bad for us students. i know it is going to be a tough desition but your going to be ok with it.

I believe that students should be able to bring their cell phones to school because of many different reasons. Such as if their parent needs to tell them something and the school line is busy, what would they do then. What if a Child Molester were to steal a kid off the playground they would have their phone to call for help, or text for help.

Now, I know these things are a little far fetched but would you risk a student like that. One of the students relatives could have died or is in the hospital and the student needs to go to a friends house after school because the parents are at the hospital that is in another town. Texting the student would be much easier that calling the school and keeping the kid from class for 10-20 minutes wouldn't it.

Now, this whole Child Molester thing most likely will not happen but i mean just in case right. It would be better if the student had there phone on them just in case something happened. Another case would be students running off to were a teacher could not see them. Jr. High, High School, Elementary it doesn't matter kids are rebellious by nature. These kids that ran off, one of them gets hurts no time to run to a teacher and run all the way back. So, what do you do you pull out your cell phone and call the school or a friend that you know will answer. Then a teacher comes and helps you and you get in trouble for not being where you were supposed to be doing. But everybody is ok, why because you let them bring their phone to school.

These things most likely will not happen but you have to think outside the box because anything can happen in this crazy mixed up world.

I am writing this letter to you about the new school policies on cell phones. Each policy has their pros and cons, and I want to give you my opinion on which will benefit the teachers and we the students. I hope you take this letter into consideration.

I will first talk about Policy 1. Policy 1 benefits the students greatly, we would be able to call and text our friends when we couldn't be together. Some phones even have internet, so we could surf the web on our own free time. Other types of phones have fun games too.

Some of the problems of this policy are some students might lose or someone may steal it. That student may blame the school, which would put some pressure on you to change the policy on cell phones. Students could also not turn their phone off and bring it to class. They would text their friends and not pay attention to important topics in class. People that have internet on their phone could look up answers and cheat. I think this policy is good, but could have some problems in the future.

Now on to Policy 2. Policy 2 is good for teachers and is ok for students. Teachers wouldn't have to worry about kids bringing their cell phones to class. Students wouldn't get distracted by their phones at times when they don't need them. They wouldn't have to worry about losing them or someone stealing their phone, and have to waste money on a new one. The cons of this policy is that some students still may sneak their phones and use the features of their phone when the teacher is looking. Some students need to call their parents after school, and without a phone, they don't know where there ride home is. This policy is also good, but no matter which policy, there could be a problem.

Out of the two policies, I think Policy 1 is the best. I need my phone everyday so i can call my parents to pick me up after my sports activities. Good students will be thankful that you chose this policy and obey the rules, turning off their cell phones during class time. If a student does break the rules and bring a phone to class, you should confiscate it for a certain period of time. If a student's phone gets stolen or he/she loses it, its their own fault and the school can't be blamed for it. This is my opinion, and i hopes it's yours too, if this policy fails the school, then by all means, try Policy 2.

Sincerely, Your Student",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

I think that Policy 1 is the best choice for our school. it seems like there is a lot of time throughout the day that there is free time. and instead of sitting around in your class doing nothing. why not be on your phone? also at lunch it seems very acceptable to be able to use your phone. lunch is your personal time to eat and socialize with your friends. it should also be aloud that you should use your phone.

Now, kids still use there phones they just have to try to hide it from there teacher. and the teacher has to spend class time taking phones and giving lectures to the person that was caught with the phone. I think that if policy 1 was chosen the amount of kids using there phones in class would greatly decrease. Because if kids knew that they could get on there phones during times like passing period and lunch. then they would not have a reason to have to be on there phones during class time, and in turn, kids would focus better in class.

It wouldn't be taking up class time, if kids could use there phones during there free time. there would be no harm in allowing students to use there cell phones during time that is already meant to be the students personal time. In a workplace, cellphones are not banned. and since school is basically a students workplace. then the same rules and freedoms should apply. Even most teachers check there phones throughout class. i think that if the teacher can have time to take away from teaching there students, because they need to get on there phones. the student should be able to use there phones during time that would not affect anyone else, because it is there personal time.

Most students use there phones to communicate with there parents during school. if there something the parent needs to tell there kid. for example, that they need to ride the bus because the parent wont be able to pick them up. a cell phone would help a lot in a situation like that.

I don't think there is any reason that kids should not be able to use there cellphones during free time. i think that if its free time it should be the kids choice what they want to do with it.

there are also a lot of days throughout the school year. that they are purely fun days. well during those days where we are watching movies just to kill time. i don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to use our phones. rather then watch a animated movie because the teacher had nothing planned.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
A585AF7C6630,"Dear Principle,

I have heard you are dealing with some issues concerning cell phone policies. I personally have seen how much time teenagers spend on their cell phones. I, being an intelligent young teenager, do not have a phone and do not want one until I drive for safety issues. When my friends and I are talking they are always on their phones texting and I am left there to do nothing but stare at the wall which makes me mad but also forms my opinion. My opinion on the matter is that teenagers can bring their phones to school and immediately turn them off during school hours. I would not allow them to use their phones during lunch periods or free time. You might think I'm being cruel but think, if kids use them during free periods they can get on the internet and look up answers and anything else the internet has to offer, which is not always good stuff. Now once free period or lunch is over most kids will forget to turn them off and you will have ring tones going off which not only interrupts the class but also the students.

Also, teenagers tend to get jealous over which phone other teens have. They say I don't have just a phone, I have The Evo 4G which will lead to disagreement over phones. What will happen when some people have phones and then they make fun of the people who don't, allowing phones will just add to bullying in your school. I also think that the young adults will steal each other's phones because of how nice they are, leading to argument and hate. The students will probably even look to you to see what has happened to your phone and what could you do about it, nothing. I think phones at school during hours is a bad idea because they are on their phones 24/7, so allowing them to use them during school just adds to that amount of media they have in their lives. With phones getting advancing so quickly, I think you should ban phones during school hours. This is my opinion on the matter. Thank you for your time.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

Everyone needs cell phones right? Many students at various schools have their cell phones with them all the time. Many students even try to text during class, even if it means getting poor academic grades. The two new policies that you have proposed, seem to bring a solution. Even though, with all due respect, one policy seems to not be a good idea. I think that policy number 2 is an excellent idea.

I think that policy number 2 is the better choice because it allows students to be more concentrated in their homework, their school work, and their personal school achievements. If a cell phone is allowed to be used during free-time or during lunch, the students may get distracted on what they are supposed to be learning from their teachers during class. If cell phones are to be not allowed in school, the students have a very good chance of not getting distracted while they are in class. This will allow them to be concentrated on their studies, than rather their social life, while in class.

I think that policy number 1 is a very bad idea because students may take this chance to text and take pictures during class while using their cell phones. This may cause a very big distraction towards their learning environment and academic grades as well as their concentration towards the material being taught to them by their teachers. Teachers may also take as a very bad situation because the students in their class would not learn any of the required academic material.

This would also implicate the students getting poor academic grades. The students who would be using their cell phones while in class would get grades such as C, D, or even F. Students may not be able to culminate or graduate because of these scores and grades. These grades would also implicate the results of their CST scores as being very low. This would bring the school's reputation as well as the CST scores to a less appropriate stance towards the LAUSD records.

These are my reasons for choosing policy 1. I think that these reasons are well enough qualified to change your mind about policy 2. I hope you take my opinion into consideration.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

TEACHER_NAME, I think you should consider policy one for lots of different reasons.

Students should be allowed to use their phones during lunch periods and free times. Sometimes we have to call home and being able to have our phones out is a privilege that would help us and if we have our phone out in class that privilege can be taken. Sometimes I has those days where I leave something at home and it would be nice if i have times during the day when I can home. You have some kids that may not follow the class part and that's where where you got to be stricter in the classroom but it would help with teaching responsibility. Not to have our phones at all is just torture we sometimes have to let our parents know things and we cant do that's my opinion with this matter as long as it doesn't begin to interfere with education we should at least be able to have them after school.

Many people in our school probably think that cell phones use should always be aloud. For me it's different , I think that cell phone use should only be aloud when students have a free period or a lunch period. This should be aloud because students may need to use there's cell phones for important things like , if there is a intruder in the school students might want to call there parents and let them know.

Students should not be able to use cell phones during school because they can be distracting & disturbing.

Cell phones are very addictive. Students may use there cell phones all day when they are at home. School is a place for learning not using your cell phones. Teachers get very annoyed when students phones go off. During school hours I think cell phones use should be limited at the time you can use them . For example, lets say we are sitting in English class & a students phone goes off. To you , the students who are also trying to do there work and the teacher it can get very annoying & very disruptive.

Students should be aloud to use there cell phones during free

& lunch periods because they aren't disrupting anyone when there cell phone goes off. Many students text their parents during school & other kids in their lunch period. Students may need to text their parents during class but they just have to wait until they get a free period .

In conclusion, in my mind students should be able to use their cell phones during free periods or lunch. Other students may think they should be able to use there cell phones during all school hours. Why do other people think that ? People can get hurt by the people who are texting in the halls & not paying attention. That is why i think students should not b e able to use cell phones during class time",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
2CD20ADA226B,"Policy one

I agree with policy one, policy one stated "" Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class."" If i was a principal i would the students have a cellular device because I would want my child to have a cell phone to contact me .

Many parents would have there sent to school with a cell phone not just because to show friends but to contact them incase of an emergency or if they need something at a particular time. A cell phone can be used for entertainment for business or for personal reasons. Cell phones are meant to be used for communication but not to be used in class. School is more important than an cellular device school will help you achieve your personal goal so you can afford you own cell phone.

Spending time on your cell phone at lunch or outside will be find with me because your not in class disturbing nobody your with your friends and having fun. I would allow my students to explore on there cell phones when any free time is giving . The rules would be the same in the class no cell phones out when teaching in class. when students caught with the cell phone I will keep it until schools out then they come pick the phone up after school.

Another reason why children should have cell phones is Parents, teacher, principals and other staff members all have cell phones . sometime you might see your teacher her phone but when the student is on there cell phone they have to get there cell phone taken up which is not fair. The rules should inflict on the teachers as well as the students in the class room. If the teacher gives the students free time then there able to be on the phones.

A student having a cell phone out in class will cause consequences but when giving free time they will have the opportunity to be the cell phone. Cell phones are use for personal reasons and for contacting parents. This letter agrees with policy one un the passage .",3,Cell phones at school,Independent

I understand that cell phones can be a distraction during school and that you are trying to decide on a policy. I think that it would be a good idea to allow students to use their cell phones during lunch and free times. We should allow students to use their cell phones because it would give them time to text their friends so that they wouldn't have to do it during class and become a distraction, they would be less tempted to use it during class if they knew that could have it out right as class was over, and need their cell phones to call people in case of an emergency.

If students had time to use their cell phones during free times, they wouldn't have to have to sneak in text while walking through the halls, and it gives them time to get one last phone call in, or one last text in so that they wouldn't need to text during class. And turning your phone off when you get in class really isn't that hard at all. Students like to socialize with cell phones so I think it is good for them to be able to socialize a bit more.

They would be a lot less tempted to use it during class if they had the opportunity to use it during lunch or while walking through the halls. It wouldn't be such an essential to text your really good friend during class because you could just use it before or after you get to class. This could also help with tarties, students wouldn't have to go all the way to the other side to the school to find their friend and be late to class, they could just text them or call them telling them what they wanted to tell them on their way to class making tarties less of an issue.

Emergencies can happen at any time of the day and students need to have their cell phones to call someone to come get them or call the police. Cell phones can be very helpful in any emergency. If a fire happens they can just call their parents to come pick them up rather than waiting for a long time for the school to call all the kid's parents that don't have cell phones. Also if you have a cell phone and your friend doesn't they can just use yours instead of waiting like all the other students, and it can help out the school by creating less people to have to use the schools phone and it will be less of a hassle for the school.

Cell phones can be a great use for everyone and teenagers like to have their cell phones with them. Having a cell phone and being able to use it during lunch and free time would make students not need it as much during class time. It would make students not be tarty as often. In emergencies a cell phone can be very useful. Giving students the opportunity to have cell phones during free time and lunch would also teach the students responsibility and it would make them much happier.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent
4E4FAB530872,"I agree with policy 1 because student should get to bring their cell phones to school. Some reasons why students should be allowed to bring them to school are, students might need to have them for family emergencies, students might need them for contacting there parents to transport them home from after school activities, students can use the calculator on there phones for math, students can take pictures with there friends, students might need to use the internet, and students can text other students to see what's up. All of these reasons can help students have a better and much easier life personally and educationally. If students weren't allowed to bring them at all there lives would be so much harder. Students could also listen to music with there cell phones. Music helps relieve stress and calm peoples nerves. It also helps people relax. The only thing bad is students could bring them to class and secretly text or some other thing and it could possibly bring there grades down. But teachers get to bring there cell phones to school and use them anytime they want so why shouldn't students? Students should have the same rights as teachers or any adults.

C2636186175F,"Policy One

I believe that students are responsible of having phones in school, but remembering to use them at the appropriate time. I feel students should actually get a chance to take on that challenge instead of letting them choose for us. We as students know that it is a reason that we shouldn't have, but teachers need to recognize to that we do need them in school for certain purposes. For example, I ride the bus home at least three times a week. Sometimes I need to call my mother to ask her questions about the transportation problem. I do realize that we do have school phone that I can use for that situation, however the system is not quick enough when you can just get it done right there.

My problem about this rule is why doesn't the rule involve everyone such as teacher, superintendents, and advisors. Why do they text and talk to people on their phone, taking personal calls when they shouldn't be allowed that. They don't have consequences for that action, but students like me do. We get it taken away and if they see it again, possibility that you wont get it until the end of that school year. Us as students know that we can get consequences for cell phones, we also know how to prevent from letting the cell phone actually for being seen. I'm not saying if they allow students to use cell phones on school hours at specific times they would use them in the right ways they need to be used. Basically we need a chance of proving ourselves wrong or could we actually be right. Policy One clearly states to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time and I think students are mature enough to handle this policy very well.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
E63B119399A4,"Dear Principal,

I think the better policy of those two offered is the first policy. For one reason, students already text during class, so if you give them the opportunity to do it in between class periods and during free times, there will be no need for them to text during class.

Another reason to let us have cell phones during free times is that if we need to fix our plans, we could call our parents and tell them what we are going to do. An example of this would be that if your after school activities were cancelled, you could call your parents and arrange for a ride.

A third reason that I like this policy is that if I wanted to go to a friends house, I could just get out my phone in between classes and call my parents and ask them if it was alright if I went. I wouldn't have to go to the office in between classes and I would already have the number programmed into my phone.

If you are afraid of students texting during class even with this policy, then you should design and give them a contract to sign. What I mean by this is that you should make and print out one contract per student. It wouldn't have to be a very fancy or official contract, just make it state that if they do text in class, they lose their privileges. It should also say that if they get caught doing it again, then they would start earning themselves detention.

If you choose the first policy, many students would be happy with your choice. I also suggest that you use some of my ideas to help.

I feel that the first cell phone policy is the superior choice. While cell phones are a distraction in the class room, not giving students the right to use them in off-periods and time not in class would encourage student to use them in class, which is distracting, the issue we are trying to avoid in the first place.

While a strict ""no phone in school"" policy does seem like the right choice at first, lets consider the cons of this policy.

1. It is practically impossible to watch every student in the classroom for discrete texting, but other students may still be distracted by it.

2. If students get no time to use their cell phones, they will still want to use them at school, and therefore use them at inconvenient times, such as during class.

3. It would take precious time out of class to correct a student every time that student is caught with his or her phone out. This would not only be distracting to other students, but take away time that teacher could be helping another student.

Now lets look at the pros of the first policy, shall we?

1. Students will be able to connect with there friends via mobile device during appropriate times, therefore reducing the urge to use them during class or other inappropriate times.

2. Students will feel as if they are being given more freedom a school, therefore raising morale among students.

3. I feel the main reason that phones are banned in class is because they represent a significant and obvious distraction and disrupted learning environment; but during lunch and off periods, there is no learning environment to disturb.

4. Not being able to connect with their friends would also urge students to talk during class more, creating an even more obvious distraction for students.

As you can see, there is only good things to be said about the second policy. And while a strict ""no phone in school"" would seen to be the more obvious choice, as one looks closer, it truly isn't.

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter, I hope you make the right choice, and abolish the ""no phone in school"" policy. Only good things with come of allowing students to use their phones in school.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent

I think students should be able to bring there cell phones to school and use them on free times cause suppose it is a emergency from your parents and they want to get in contact with you at least they know you have a cell phone the reason i agree with policy one is because in case of an emergency , you just want to listen to music on your free time or you just want to have your phone with you.

In case of an emergency you will have a phone to contact your parent or guardian or your parent or guardian can contact you suppose the school was on fire you would want to let your parents no about it so you can just call them on your cell phone or any other minor injuries you can just aware them about it.

On free time most students will want to listen to music if there bored and some teachers may not understand but music helps a lot of teenagers now a days to concentrate and it can also help you focus but its not that bad you can listen to your music on free time.

Music is one of the things most of teenagers like to listen to so i think we should have cell phones allowed at our school

Most teenagers just like to have there phone with them at all times so they can show everyone or just for them to have like if you want to know the time and the television is off in the classroom you can just look on your phone and if your parents are trying to text you something like saying don't ride the bus today it can be very helpful to have your phone .

A lot of teenagers love having there cell phones so i think policy 1 is really good because of emergencies or any sort of injures or anything you can have your phone with you at all times to call up your parents or who ever you call you so i hope everyone else would agree on policy 1            ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
6B4CE12D92B5,"Dear Principal,

Nowadays most kids carry around cell phones for emergencies or just to be able to connect with each other. I strongly believe kids should be able to bring their phones to school incase of family emergencies or because of a medical problem. Even though many kids use them to mostly socialize they can be very useful in a life or death situation. For example, If a student was having a medical problem during lunch and they couldn't reach the clinic in time they could take out their cell phone and ask their parents to pick them up immediately. I strongly recommend policy as opposed to not being able to have immediate help.

Another reason kids should be able to have cell phones on campus is that they can call for help when they are seriously injured and there's no one around to help them. Like say that someone had fallen down a flight of stairs and had shattered their arm and there's no one around to hear them call for help, they could whip out their phone and dial for help. As for not having them on in class, I completely agree because they shouldn't be on at all time on campus.

All In all I think students should be able to carry around a phone incase of impending danger and or a medical problem. I hope you agree with my statement and have good judgement.

I think policy 1 would be best solution which is; students are allowed to have a cell phone not during class but only when its free time or lunch periods because there can be a problem In their house or somewhere else and they need to know as soon as possible.

They can only use It when Its free time And That's It. All Phones Should Be Turned Off While They Are In A Class.

If a student breaks the rule and gets caught with a cell phone then minis well pick policy 2 which Is; Students are not allowed to bring cell phones at all what so ever. Students can try if you give them a chance to try. students need their cell everywhere they go because anything can happen such as; there could be a fire in the school, or anything else that is tragic.

If we bring our phones why would that be a problem? That would have nothing to do with the teachers. Teenagers need their phones in case of emergencies. I need my phone because my mom and dad need to know what's going on with me. I have track practice after school and I go to tutoring for math and science because my grades are my number one priority. I have to get into a good college. If we turn our phones off during classes it wouldn't be a distraction and we couldn't do anything with them and if the student doesn't turn their phone off their phone should be taken away until their parents come and get it.

FBC7DC3C27C0,"To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this letter regarding your policy on cell phones during school hours. In my opinion, I believe Policy 1 is the better choice for our school. If cell phones are allowed to be used during free times and lunch, it would have a better effect on the students. As school goes on, the curriculum becomes more difficult which encourages students to study harder and focus more on getting higher grades. While their grades are very important, this may create stress on some students which may even lead them to get lower grades.

Permitting the use of students' cell phones during school could possibly reduce the stress they have from being the studious children that they are. Having less stress and pressure on them may result in higher marks and eventually an exemplary school. This could benefit the school district greatly and this policy can be spread to other schools so that all of our campuses can be exemplary.

Another reason why this cell phone policy could result in a positive outcome for our school is it could maybe even save lives. For example, if there is a fatal emergency in the cafeteria that involves choking, a student could simply dial 911 to get an ambulance there as soon as possible.

There may be some issues when first putting the policy in order, but once students get used to the idea that they are allowed to use their phones during free time only, they won't bother with sneaking any texts during class. To prevent cell phone usage during class, students should be allowed to go to their lockers after lunch to put them away while under the supervision of an administrator. This keeps them from cheating on tests, contacting anyone outside school, and being distracted in class.

I really believe this change in your school's regulation could help your students develop into a fully grade A campus and be even better than before. I am hoping for your kind consideration.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
CB97EA7E4FB7,"Your principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. she is allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as the phone are turned off during class time my possion is that its a not a good idea to use phones while in free time and lunch periods because people will give out maybe test answers, make drama out of something and call people who are in different schools that don't have the same rules ass use.

Additionally people maybe well give out answers to a big test. by this i mean the answers might be wrong and people are copying what the person text them. the teacher might of change each test for each period. People are going to get mad at the person who give the answers to them. for example my sister friend text her the math quiz answers and she got caught and fail the test she told me "" never let someone bring you down with them its a big deal.""

People would make drama over something little. to help my answer what i mean is people would get there phones stolen. People would say someone did it and get them suspended and it may not be them.

they probably would fight over a phone that looks better then there. there's this one time my friend RELATIVE_NAME that got into a big problem over a phone she said "" i would never use my phone in school property again"".

Furthermore people who text other people from other schools might get there phone taken always. all schools don't have the same rules. they would get mad at the person for making a mistake like that. People just don't get the point that they need to pay attention to class and worry about school. school is only 9 hours and that's it you could have the rest of the time to text. i used to get in trouble a lot and get my phone taken always. till this one day my mom said ""you have all day to text get your grades up.""

Looking back one can see that your principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. she is allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as the phone are turned off during class time wether its people will give out maybe test answers, make drama out of something or call people who are in different schools that don't have the same rules ass use. now if you excuse me i have to listen to my teacher and get a good grade in my test.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

Dear Whom It May Concern,

Not allowing kids to have phones out at school it the best option.

Not having the phones would mean that they could focus more in class and not be distracted so much.

Kids would be involved with more drama if phones were allowed at school.

Inappropriate text messages and pictures could be sent while at the school, via cell phone, and most parents would not like their children to be involved with this.

One reason phones should not be allowed at school is distractions.

Kids already get distracted very easily and don't pay attention in class.

With the phones, they wouldn't pay attention any more than they already did.

They would be too busy texting or on the phone with someone than to be studying for a test, or finishing homework.

Another reason phones should not be allowed is more drama would be started.

Rumors start drama, and no one likes drama.

Rumors are mainly started by texting, and with phones kids would have the opportunity to text and spread rumors more than they do without them.

Drama can cause conflicts between teachers and students, students and parents, parents and teachers, and students and students.

The last reason phones should not be allowed is they are not necessary.

Now kids aren't allowed to have phones and some choose to not obey the rules.

If caught, they are punished for not obeying the school rules.

Kids can fully function without their phone in their hands the whole time.

Obviously since phones aren't allowed now and children can talk to each other and carry on their social lives, there is no point in having them at school.

No phones at school is the best decision there is.

Although some kids may need music to study or work to their fullest extent, they can do that home.

Phones can cause so many problems between people, and no one wants to bring that into the school. The policy on no phones allowed at school should stay the way it is.

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I agree on policy two, that there should be no cell phones allowed in school.

I think that if we would choose policy one, students wouldn't obey the policy. Even though Students would enjoy using their cell phones at lunch and other free-times, they would most likely sneak their phones and text during a lesson in class. Also, if the school allowed cell phones, students might forget to turn their phone off, and it would ring. The ringing cell phone would be a distraction to other students, disabling learning. I don't think students need to be using their cell phones at lunch and other free time because most of their friends that they would text or call would be in the same room.

If we chose policy two, there wouldn't be any distractions because there wouldn't be any cell phones at all.

What is more important? Having students not be able to use their cell phones during free time, or students not being able to learn because of cell phone distractions? Students not being able to learn is more important, and that is why I choose policy two, to have no cell phones in school at all.

I think that you should not allow phones to be used at all in school.

If you allow phones to be used at certain times in school students will soon get to comfortable with the idea and want to use them all the time. If you allow students to use phones in lunch there could be sexing or cyber bulling going on in your school.

Many phones will be lost and stolen if this is allowed.

This idea of have phones allowed to be used at certain times in the day is not a good idea at all and should never be put through.

Policy two is the way to go.

If phones are allowed in lunch and free periods kids will get comfortable with the idea of having phones on them at all times.

If students have their phones out for lunch they may keep them on and with them for the rest of the day. You get so used to having that little square in your pocket you might forget to take it out and put it in your locker after lunch.

This can lead to phones going off during class and distraction from class because students are texting under the tables.

Phones are useful and can be good but they can also be used for bad.

In school if this is allowed the number of cyber bulling and sexing will go up trumendouly.

There are all sorts of problems and fights that go on in school but if you give them a loaded gun they will only use it for bad.

There would be many more detention and guidance visits from the students if this is allowed.

This will make your staff stress out and angry.

Children these days are clumsy and forgetful. If you let them take there phones out of their pockets every minute to answer a text they will most likely lose it somewhere.

If someone have that brand new cool phone there will be people who will steal it.

That will cause fights and just many more problems.

This will lead to more fights and a lost and found full of phones.

This idea is just not good for anyone.

It will cause distractions and poor grades.

It will cause more sexing, cyber bulling, and will lead to stressed out angry staff members.

This proposition will also lead to a full lost and found and fights.

Policy two needs to be brought to action and policy one should never be passes.

Do not allow phones to be used at school at all!

E392A61F0E02,"I think Policy number 1 is better because you need to have your phone in case of emergency. Another example is that you should turn it off in classes but on your free time you can have it on.

You need to bring your phone to school in case of emergency. Because what if your parent or someone your close to got hurt and your mom or dad is trying to reach you in school and you don't have your phone with you. Another reason is say if your stuck in school and you need your parent to pick you up from school, and if you don't have your phone and your parents are looking for you. They might think you got lost or kidnapped or you just ran away from home.

You should bring your phone to school but you should have it turned off in class.

Because if you take a test it should be off and if you have it on and your teacher finds it on they can say you are cheating on a test. Another example is when it is free time you can have it out because it is free time you should be able to do what you want on your free time.

65286FBCAD2D,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think students should not be allowed to use our cell phones during lunch and free period.

I think this because of cheating, bullying, and disturbance in class.

Because cell phones are an easy way to communicate students will take it for granted on tests, essays or homework.

Students will be able to give an answer or even the questions on the test with ha click of a button.

This is not fair to other students who studied hard or did their homework when they were suppose to.

teachers will notice a dramatic change in grades from period one to period seven.

Even though students would only be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and free period, answers still travel quick. Because of cell phone use answers to tests, essays or homework will be spread to the whole school.

Isn't school suppose to be a friendly and safe environment? I know that with cell phones the bullies have more sneaky ways and techniques to bully a peer. When sending a text message it is received by the person instantly.

Therefore more horrific comments will be spread all over during lunch and free period.

With cell phones these nasty comments will not be caught.

Chances are no will no but the two bullies texting and receiving the messages.

When bullies know that they are not going to get caught they will keep bullying.

Then the bullying trend will come an even more popular style.

You might think that all students are going to listen and turn off their cell phones during class but they wont.

They will take advantage!

During class students come to learn and expand their knowledge.

With the disturbance of constant ringing and vibrating their learning experience will be interrupted.

I know that teachers want to have a learning environment but when they hear a cell phone they will lecture on about how that is not acceptable.

That too will take away from the students learning time. Cell phones are suppose to be helpful but not disruptive.

Students might love the idea having usage of cell phones allowed, but it would not be a good choice.

Cell phone usage during lunch and free period will have students chatting on tests, essays, and homework.

cell phones also will increase bullying and will be a huge distraction during school.

School is a safe environment and cell phones will interfere with your students learning experience.

1D6257F878C4,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have been informed that you are thinking about adjusting the school polices for cell phones. Well, I must confess, I do not have a cell phone, so I may not be the best person to ask in this issue. However, I feel you should be a bit less lenient with cell phone use in school, and here's why.

First up, the most obvious reason: they are a distraction. How can any student concentrate on school if they hear a constant buzzing noise, or if they hear their obnoxious ring tone going off every few minutes? You may wonder why this would be a problem in the classroom if students are only aloud to use them in the hallways or in between classes, but for convenience purposes, to save a trip the locker every time we would want to use it, we'd keep it in our pockets. If we ""accidentally"" leave them on, they'd disrupt the class. Plus, if one class is working while another class is changing classes, I'd bet RELATIVE_NAME talking loudly to his girlfriend in California is a bit more interesting than Bohr models, so that would naturally throw the class off a bit.

Second of all, cell phones can really cause stress. My elder brother has a cell phone, and I can tell without even asking him that he just received a text that had bad news. In the class room, that can cause a bit of trouble. For sake of example, let's say RELATIVE_NAME just got a break-up text. Yep, she sure is going to focus on the Battle of Trenton in history for sure next class!

Lastly, let's say RELATIVE_NAME's family is really struggling money-wise right now. They can't afford the cheapest pay phone in the book right now, so naturally, he can't have one. Meanwhile, RELATIVE_NAME has the latest and greatest Droid on the planet, and she's always showing it off. ...What's this? Did she leave her locker open just a little? RELATIVE_NAME is really tempted (really, really tempted) to just reach in there and...

Which brings me to my final reason: if cell phones are constantly receiving attention in school, therefore, encouraging crime. After all, I know a big, shiny Droid is pretty hard to pass up, no matter what the means of getting it.

So, for these reasons, I believe cell phones should be banned from school.

To whom it may concern,

I believe that cellular devices or cell phones should be not allowed during free periods and lunch.

I Believe this because sometimes you need to contact family members, For example when there is an emergency going on with your family; someone is hospitalized, somebody has passed away , but that is not always the case.

I also see them as a distraction if being used for different reasons but, when these rules are made some people would like to be allowed to have them on campus, but the choices the district make are for our benefit in learning and succeeding in the real world.

In reality you cannot sit in your office and text the whole time you are there, so why start the bad habits now?

These devices are not bad but i believe it is not helping you to have them with either.

I understand some of the reasons other people would like to have the privilege to carry a cell phone but the way i see it most people do not follow the rules and take it out hiding it, and secretly texting or calling people.

Do not get me wrong i love having my cell phone but not being in contact with your family and friends for six hours will not kill anybody.

I know there will be many students now and to come that will disagree, but if you want to do well in school texting in class will not help you keep an ""A"" in any class.

Even having the temptation could be a distraction to your self and will not keep you focused.

Texting not only distracts you from the teacher some of the others around you can be distracted by it also.

So in conclusion I hope you see that this will not only benefit us but our grades because kids will have no choice but to pay attention.

I'm writing this letter to inform you that Cell phone at lunch should be okay and all of the free times that we have. While school is going on. Texting in class will keep the children's and teen's from learning on what the teachers are trying to teach them. And if i was the teacher i would have done made the rule of teacher letting the students text friend's during school as in lunch, or free times between classes. when there in the hall's. For the thought that if your in class then your not lurning much of anything but putting text messages in your head. On the other side of why it's not a good ideal of student's having phones in school is because most people are nothing but drama. As in they will start conflicts and always' need to go and see you.

Most students that have cell phones all they are doing on them is starting drama because when one person gets a text message then theirs going to be another student getting the drama shown on there phone so for and so on. Cell phone's travel as in the text message one person and can tell you something very sad and you don't want anyone else knowing but your friend. Then if you and your friend get into a fight then there's going to be Drama with in you and your old friend you all will get into a big fight. All texting in ways is drama because people are childish in all kinds of ways harassment, bulling.

Then theirs way's that I can see why teacher and you don't want the students to have there cell phones out any place at school is because of the internet students get on facebook, or anything that can get people starting in with drama. The facebook can lead to harassment, and bulling just as the text messages can. In lots of way's I do see where the teachers are getting at that cell phones are not safe for the school regulation. Because students can and will get hurt if the drama on cell phones is stated then the kids and teen's parents might contact the school and yell and most teachers around don't want that happening.

That's why cell phone should not be in classes but during lunch and free space of time yes they should be allowed.

You should allow students to bring their cell phones to school.

One reason is, they can call their parents.

Also, they can keep then off when they are in classes.

Last, the students can have them out during free time, and when they are at lunch.

Students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school so they can contact their parents.

First, if they stay after school, they can let their parents know they need picked up.

They could stay after for a sport and they needed their cell phones to let their parents know they needed picked up when they were done with practice.

Next, they could ask their parents to bring their gym clothes or something else they forgot.

If they forgot a project or some homework at home they can let their parents know they forgot it and see if they can bring it to school for them.

Second, the students could keep their phones off during the classes.

If they keep their phones off then they won't be bothering them while they are in classes.

If they have them on in a class and it goes off it could disrupt some ones concentration if they are taking a test.

Also, they won't have their phones on in the middle of class so that they won't be tempted to take it out of their pocket and text or call someone.

Last, If they keep them off in classes the kids won't have out their phones texting each other answers to a test if they are taking one.

Last, the students could have their phones on during free time and lunch time.

If they needed to borrow some ones notes because they needed to get caught up on them they can ask the person to meet them by a place so they can borrow the notes.

Next, they can keep their phones on during free time to let someone know that they are done using the notes, or to help them on something that they are stuck on.

Finally, they could let someone borrow their phone because they don't have on or just forgot it at their house.

In conclusion, you should let the students have their cell phones in school.

They could keep them off in the class but then have them out during free time.

Also, they could call their parents to remind them to pick them up or to bring them something.

C8E30EE22644,"The best policy, in my opinion, would be the first policy, or policy one.

That is the best policy to choose because the students will bring their cell phones to school anyways even if you choose policy two.

The students will not be using them as often if the first policy is chosen, because most people at our school work differently.

They are told they can bring cell phones, they won't bring them.

When they are told they can't bring cell phones, they will bring cell phones and won't care if it is taken up in class because they are texting when phones aren't allowed at all.

They will try to text in the bathroom and call their parents or their friends when they are in the bathroom, but this could be avoided if the bathrooms had speakers in them where the office could hear everything that is going on, so they could also hear about fights and then they would be able to break it up and know exactly who started it.

The students would be able to use their phones during their lunch period and during other breaks, and they would be happy with that.

They would be texting their parents during the lunch period to tell them if they feel sick or texting their friends, asking them what they are doing after school.

This would especially help the kids in high school, who go out partying with their friends after school, so they can ask their friends what they are doing after school and if they want to go party at the usual place they can go partying at.

When they can use their cell phones during their lunch period, they will ask their girlfriend or just their regular friends what they are doing after school and if they wanted to go for a walk, go eat in various places, or if they wanted to go see a movie.

If they said that they did want to go somewhere, they can decide through texting rather than going to sit across the room just to ask them one thing and deciding where to go, which could take the whole time.

If the policy is changed, there would need to be a couple of changes made, such as speakers in the bathrooms, so the office could hear what was going on, whether it is someone texting their parents, calling their parents, calling their friends, or texting their friends, which would possibly get them in trouble if their cell phone was on vibrate or they had their volume set anywhere from one through seven, which the usual volume is seven on anyone's phone, even if they are in school and know that they can get in trouble.

This can happen anytime during the day except at lunch period, which is everyone's favorite time to use a cell phone.

There are also exceptions to when they can bring their cell phone to school.

For example, they shouldn't be allowed to bring their cell phone to school during MCT testing time.

There are ways to make sure that they don't have one during this test.

You can make a phone call that goes out to every student in the classroom, and if a phone rings you can take it up and give it back to them after the test is over.

Then the student will know that they are not allowed to bring their cell phone to school during MCT testing time.

There are also ways to make sure that a student doesn't have their cell phone on during class time.

You can make periodic calls that go out to every student in the building, and if their cell phone rings they can be informed that they must turn it off.

The periodic checks can be made every 30 minutes.

When a student's cell phone rings more than once, then their phone must be taken up, and they should get a referral from the office for in-school detention, or, possibly however many times it rang, out-of-school detention.

When this happens, they must be informed that only their parent can pick up the cell phone, and only during a certain time of the day.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

I think that students should not have their phones at school at all because not all students will listen to the rules.

One reason I choose policy 2 is because some kids would use them during class and then they would get in trouble.

They would be used to cheat on tests, text friends, and get on the internet.

Many kids would use them to look up answers for papers, tests, homework, or any other projects.

Some might even use them to get on chat rooms or any other website, like facebook and myspace.

Some students would then forget to turn them off, if they were allowed to have them on during free times.

Then they would become a interruption to the educational process.

Teachers would have to stop class and have to tell the student to turn it off or even some teachers would take the phones.

Many kids would have to pick up the phones at the end of the day so they didn't get in trouble again.

More kids would get their phones out after they finish something in class, like homework or a project even if they weren't allowed.

Many students would get in trouble with their phones then without them.

Some students could even use the cameras on their phones to take mean pictures or inappropriate pictures.

There would be more bullying going on with classmates and friends.

Mean stuff could be sent around the school about other kids.

Some kids would even send out rumors causing someone to get hurt.

There would be more causes of kids getting bullied if students were allowed their phones.

Many students would use them so much during lunch that they would get into their conversations with others that they would not eat their lunch.

That would have more students wasting their lunches.

Sometimes there would even be a ton of leftovers that the cooks made and then you would eat the leftovers the next day for lunch.

Students having their phones could cause some major damage to friendships and grades.

That is why I think you should not allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, even if they are turned off during class time.      ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent

I think we should have cell phones for that if we forget a number and you need it you can get it. Because of the fact that we forget parents number to is a reason for having a cell phone.

That is best for us students. we need cell phones to help us not forget numbers. instead of caring a sheet of paper. you can just get your phone out and go to the contacts.

we should be able to use them when in gym,lunch,and outside. And that teachers keep there phones out and can text call or anything like that we need the same thing.

i understand that some students will get careless and just text and class. that is when it need to be taken up. because you are in class to learn not to text. but we don't learn nothing in lunch or outside. but we learn in health but not in gym playing basketball all the time.

all you do in our gym class is do your exercise and then play basketball or football.

i know it help you learn these sport but that just a class to text or call in. you should not text or talk in a library. because a library is a place of quiet and noise from your cell phone is not tolerated. why you are walking it is not good because you bump into people who might get mad at you. you should not be able to text during crct because you may run out of time and fail the test.

because without the crct you will have to retake and then if you fail you are retained.

All I'm trying to say is that students should be able to use cell phones only in places where is not learning nothing. you know what to do let us use only in none learning places.

I am writing this letter to let you know that you should let your students bring phones to school. Some principals don't let their students bring phones to school at all. I think phones should be brought to school and should be used during lunch time or any other free time, not during class time. Many students get their phones taken away everyday for either texting in class, or using when they are not suppose to. Teachers use their phones at school also, so students should too. Honestly I bring my phone to school, but I only use during free time just like when you are suppose to use it. The only other time should be able to use their phone is if an emergency happens the teacher can't contact the office. Lunch time is a real good time to use their phone because it is a free time and class isn't taking place. Some students usually have to show their friends a picture, or a text, etc. The schools that don't let their students bring cell phones to school should. I think bringing cell phones to school is a great idea and lot other students think it is a good idea also. Now it is time for you to choose whether to let students bring cell phones to school or not.

Your Student,

934980B8A79A,"In my opinion I think Policy 1 would be the best. Using cell phones in are free time would be better than not using them at all. They should also be off when they are in classes or taking test. Some people like to talk to there friends about what happen over the phone last night and want to show them the text messages. Plus teenagers love to talk to people so when there friend is in another room they can text them what happened in there class.

Not having phones at all in school wouldn't be to good. Some people might have something important to tell there parents. Like if they were staying after just send a quick text or call them, rater than having to wait in the office to just say ""I am staying after."" There could also be an emergency like a family member died or things like that.

People could also just need to talk to people in school. Like asking them if they can have a ride home. They also could be talking to someone very important. Like a cousin from another state or someone from a different school.

I agree with Policy 1. Text in free time, lunch, and at their lockers. A lot of people would love to text people during class. I don't think they should call in class because they could be texting answers to there friends who wasn't in that class yet. That's why there should be off when they are in class. After school would also work to like when they are walking to there bus or to there car. I agree with policy 1.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
