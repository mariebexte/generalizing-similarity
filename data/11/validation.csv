F3FD0BC0028C,"""When in dought ask for help."" We all have different opinions and sometimes we want to know what others think about it. I think asking more than one person for there thoughts or opinions can be very helpful because, sometimes I dont know what to choose and when I ask my friends if they can help me choose between something because I cant, they all choose different things with there own opinions and explanations. Sometimes if Im not sure with what I am doing I ask my friends or family members for there opinions. Some of my friends and family members think its okay and the rest dont.

Choosing something for me can be difficult at times. I like to ask my friends on what they think or what there opinions are. I once was not sure on what shoes to buy at the time. I could of either bought Nike or Vans. It was really hard because I wanted both but at the time I could only get one. So I asked my friends on what shoes they like the most and why. One of my friends told me I should get Vans because they were pretty. My other friends told me I should get the Nike because they make you taller and there more comfortable. And I agreed with them so I ended up getting Nike. My mom and I love to go shopping. One time I was only allowed to get one item from the store. I really wanted to get two shirts but I couldnt. I sent my friends a picture and asked them ""which one do you think is prettier?"" They all choose the same shirt so I told my mom I was going to get that one, but my mom liked the other one because it covered up more. I explained to her that for me it wouldnt show as much. And I got the the shirt. My parents are very adventurous they love going places. This summer that is coming up I can either go to Guatemala for two weeks or I can go to Florida for two weeks. I have already been to those places and I really like them both. There both really pretty places. I asked my friends what they they would choose. Half of them told me I should go to Guatemala so I can see some of my family. the other half said there would be less money spent if I went to Florida. It was a very hard decision but they convinced me in going to Guatemala so I can see some of my family.

We have all had a time where we didnt know if we should or shouldnt do something. And when thats happens to me I always ask my friends or family members what they think. Last fall me and my best friend went to

Generic_Name for the Halloween fest. I got really scared at night, we were going to go into a haunted house but I wasnt sure if still wanted to go. I was scared when I told my friend that I wasnt sure if I still wanted to do that. She told me, ""Well you dont have to but just remember we already payed for this and we are doing it together."" I decided to ask my brother what he thinks he told me ""Its okay I dont care anyway"" I knew my friend was right so I went in the haunted house with her holding on as hard as I could because I was really scared. At the end of the day I was glad I told her because I had a blast that night. One time I was invited to a party my mom said I could go but I had to be safe. I wasnt sure if i should go because I knew the people at that party did stuff they shouldnt. I thought of it the whole week and I decided to ask my friend what she thought about sh said ""if you want to go you can go I dont care."" I still wasnt sure with that so I asked my other friend and she told me ""I dont think you should go to the party if you know whats going to happen. Your my best friend and I know you can decide too but I think its better if you dont go and you stay home where its safe."" After she told me that I knew for sure I wasnt going to the party. This year someone I liked asked me out. My friends were telling me that I should say yes. That day I decided to tell my mom. She told me ""I dont think its a good idea for you to start dating right know, I dont want that getting in the way of your studies you are still very young and you will find someone if the future."" I decided to take her advice and say no. My friends were upset with me that I didnt say yes. I didnt really care because I knew it was the right decision for me.

I think asking more than one person for there opinions is a good idea because, sometimes I dont know what to choose and I ask my friends if they can help me choose. Other times if Im not sure if Im doing the right thing

EB6C2AF20BFE,"People sometimes have a different opinion than others and that is fine. For example, my brother and I have a different opinion on what the best sport is.

258F5D734299,"Why do people ask for advise from more then one person?

When people are seeking advise, they will sometimes ask more than one person. Why do people do this? Usually, that person wants more than one perspective, they may want to understand different opinions. Think of it as a serve, your eating at a restaurant and the waitress gives you a slip of paper asking ""

how'd we do?""

The restaurant wants to understand what they can do to make dinning there better.

There are many other ways that explain why people ask for advise from more than one person. In order to find the best reason to understand why people ask more than one person for advise maybe to do it your self. Some examples maybe to ask some friends, ""

whats' your favorite color ""

or

"" what did you think about the big game last night.""

Simple questions can have simple answers, but have a great impacted on what your looking for. Eventually, you find what your looking for and you would know what your favorite colors and things to eat are.

Asking multiple people the same question could provide many outcomes too. For example, say you were thinking about getting the newest game console, but you also want to get the latest phone, and you have enough money only to get one. You could ask people what they think that you should get first if cannot make a decision. If I were debating on getting a new console, or the latest phone I would use tally marks to keep tract of all the votes. That way you won't forget about all the vote of the people you asked. You got the new console, and the next thing you know you here about the latest phone catching on fire. Talk about a good outcome!

If still don't get why a person may ask different people the same question then just think of it like voting. You maybe thinking voting is a totally different organization, not quite. In theory, voting has a lot to do with the prompt: why do people ask for advise from more then one person. Its literally in the name, voting is like asking people what'd they think, and the outcome is who or what wins the vote. As you can see the previous votes have not had a such good outcome. ""Donald Trump.""

In conclusion, when people ask for advise, yes, they will sometimes talk to more than one person, because maybe the best advise isn't the first thing you hear. Thats why people do it. To find a difference. To find the best difference. Finally, multiple opinions from multiple people can come into role and help someone make better choices.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
C5EF5C407C10,"Do you know some of the main reasons people seek out different opinions to make a better choice? if you want to know the answer to that question, please feel free to read on.

The first reason why people seek out multiple opinions to make a better choice is for wisdom . With wisdom you can get life experience from other people. They might have dealt with it so you can ask what they did to help or solve the situation. You can ask them what they would've done better or different to resolve the conflict.

Another reason people seek out multiple opinions to help make a better choice is different point of views and opinions . They do this because you can get different people's perspective. You can also see how they would feel about the situation. You can see what they would do and how they would react in the situation.

Finally, that last and final reasons people would get multiple opinions to make a better decision is so they can have options . Having options means you can get new ideas on how to take the task head on. You can also get ideas on how to approach the problem and solve it. You can see what other people would have done with the problem, get estimates on what the end result would have been if they would have done it that way, and choose the options that is best for you and the situation. You can also have more options to choose from on how to do and resolve the task at hand.

I believe the getting wisdom from others, having options, and having different opinions or, point of views is why people seek out multiple opinions to make a better choice.  ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
27D3919AEAE2,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This seems rather odd to us to ask someone else rather than ourselves what choice to chose, but asking some one else for advice is actually very important and effective. Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because some people are wise, you have many different opinions from other people to choose from, and you might not like the choice you thought of.

To begin with, seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because some people are wise. They may have been in a same or similar situation you may be in, they learned what they saw and is telling it to others along the way, they have greater wisdom about the world, having strong and thoughtful advice as well as being trustworthy people who would not try to steer others in the wrong direction, and they can pull or convince you to go into the right way to being a better person, in fact, some books and movies actually teach this lesson to the audience so they can learn it. All in all, you should get advice from people who are wise and are not on the bad side of life.

Next, you have many different opinions from other people to choose from. People from all the countries in the world see one thing or action different from how another person thinks, some have good outcomes while others have unhelpful outcomes, others might not understand what you are telling them so they might guess and give the wrong answer to you, singling out some of the advice given will make the chances of having a good outcome even greater, and people who known what their talking about, are often correct and suggest better pickings. To sum up, it is very good to have multiple opinions from others to see if one of their advice is better than the other.

Finally, you might not like the choice you thought of. It could end in an unpleasant outcome with bad consequences, your opinion could make you fall in with the wrong crowd of people, there is a high chance that stress will come to anyone who struggle with coming up with something to do, this may also cause you to have little confidence when you can not come up with advice for yourself, even though, it is okay to not know something and it is also fine to ask or talk to someone who dose know it, and do not try to come up with advice to something you can not do or know very little about. To warp it all up, if you come up with advice that dose not sound very wise, please ask another person so they can teach you the right way so you can be safe.

In conclusion, s eeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because some people are wise, you have many different opinions from other people to choose from, and you might not like the choice you thought of. You should care about this because many young kids and adults often do not ask others for advice because they do not know any better or refuse to ask another person they do not known to ask them for advice to do or not to do something, end up doing it that might get them in trouble or even get hurt. So that is why advice giving by people is so important because it steers those into the right path and get them up on their feet. So if you plan to hear or give advice to another person, tell them something wise a easy to understand so they could possibly pass it on to others. If you do this, then you will feel very confident in yourself and give advice where ever you go. If you do not do this, then you will not know what is right or wrong from another persons advice and you will likely not live a great life where you give advice but instead deny advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

By: Generic_Name

Have you ever gotten into a situation and you are not sure what to do? Well, for most people the first thing they do is ask for others opinions. They ask for this hoping that the other peoples opinions can help provide them a solution to their issue or conflict. However, some people say asking for the opinion of other is useless and unneeded, but that not true. Asking multiple people what they think can be very beneficial due to them helping you gain different perspectives, view something differently, and avoiding previous mistakes. All these thing can help improve your decision making and hears why.

Solving an issue or conflict by yourself can be challenging. However, one thing most people tend to forget is to look at an opposing force from a different view point. Now, for some people, looking form another perspective is challenging. Although, that's why asking for peoples opinion can be useful. When you ask a multitude of people for advice you gain fresh insight on an issue that can help aid you into seeing it form another eyes. For example, a detective or officer asking multiple eye witnesses to to recount an event. They do this in order to gain perspective on a matter from multiple standpoints, this help them find clues for their investigation. Now, listening to other peoples perspectives can improve your decision making, but what else can?

Everyone hold their own opinions. Whether it's simple not liking a certain food ,or being that one person to like school, that's all someones opinion. However, even though it is your opinion their are a multitude of things that can change it. One of those things is someones else opinion. Asking people for their opinion can possibly change or alter how you view something. An example of this is, theirs a person that doesn't enjoy reading, but they ask some of their friends why they do. Due to their responses they decide to pick up a book and read it, and before they know it they enjoy reading. Being able to change how you view and observer something can greatly benefit your decision making, but is their anything else?

Everyone makes mistakes in their life, whether their big or small. However, one thing people tend to do in order to prevent mistakes is to ask for advise. When you ask multiple people for their opinion on a matter their answer can help you avoid commonly made mistakes. Another reason to ask for peoples opinion is due to most peoples opinions being formed off their own experiences. Due to this you can learn from their experiences without having to go through them yourself. This can help you avoid hardship and past mistakes in your decision making.

Asking for the opinion of others has a multitude of benefits on your decision making. Firstly, it can help you gain multiple perspectives on an issue or conflict. Another benefit of asking for multiple opinions is due to it helping you view something differently. Lastly, asking for peoples opinions can help you prevent mistakes that have already been made before.

A814BD710140,"""LET ME GO!"" Generic_Name shouted. Generic_Name was struggling to escape the breath taking choke hold she was in. Her mind flooded with horrendous thoughts. Generic_Name's date was trying to kidnap her. While she was fighting for her life,all she could think about was how she regretted meeting up with this dangerous,strange man. In hope to find a partner, Generic_Name downloaded a dating app. She was aware of the risks of chatting with and meeting strangers, but she was not bothered by it. Generic_Name was going to seek opinions from her close friends, but she knew they would not approve. Generic_Name felt that since she was an adult, it was her duty make her own decisions, and deal with the consequences without the validation of others. She soon found out that her decision was a bad idea. Generic_Name should have asked for her friends' opinions in making the decision to meet up with a stranger from a dating app. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by introducing their mind to different points of views, seeing how options weigh out, and gaining wisdom from others.

Introducing a person's mind to different points of views can help the person make a better choice. While making a decision, it is important to seek advice from others. Being introduced to how different people would handle a situation or make a choice, can help a person make a more beneficial choice. For example, if Generic_Name would have asked three of her friends how they felt about the dating app, the scary situation in the beginning possibly could have been prevented. One friend could have told her to be careful and bring protection just in case, the other may have suggested to meet up in a public area with a numerous amount of people, and the other friend could have listed all the dangers about meeting with strangers. A couple of her friends could have mentioned to her how they would meet up with someone safely, and the other friend could have opened her mind to scary perspectives of meeting with a man online. Generic_Name would have made a better choice if she would have considered the different points of views. Be aware of who you take advice from. Always make sure the person that is introducing you to different point of views is someone you can put your trust into.

Seeing how options weigh out can help some make a better choice too. To further explain,when you weigh out options you are determining how one decision or choice you make can be more beneficial than the other choice or decision. If Generic_Name would have went to a trusting adult or relative, they could have informed her about the pros and cons of dating apps. They could have informed her about the number of kidnaps or deaths that relate to dating apps,or the low number of striving relationships. With that knowledge, Generic_Name could have weighed out her options. She could have used that knowledge to make a better choice. For example, Generic_Name's options were to be single and discontinue the use of the dating app, or meet a stranger and possibly start a risky relationship. If the cons seemed worse on the ''meet a stranger and possibly start a risky relationship'' side, than she would have weighed out her options, and chosen to be single. When you weigh out your options, make sure you have full knowledge on all possible choices.

Finally, gaining wisdom from others is another way for someone to make a better choice. When someone shares their wisdom with you, it can alter the way you think or perceive things. All it takes is a wise individual to share their thoughts and advice with you, for you to make a better choice. Generic_Name could have possibly talked to her mother, or a wise person in her life and asked them for their intake or thoughts about her dating app situation. Gaining advice from someone who is wiser than you can make you deeply consider your choices. If a wise person in Generic_Name's life would have told her not to force relationships or just wait on your true love to appear, she would have deleted the app and been patient. When you look up to someone, especially if their wise, you take what they say into a deeper understanding. When gaining wisdom from others,take it into deep consideration.

Sparkling lights filled the room while blush colored flowers made a trail down the isle. The room had a peachy aroma. People slowly entered the church and the murmurs of voices were filling the air.

If she would have went on that date, she would have never met her soon to be husband. Generic_Name was in love and happier than she had ever been. She was so glad she listened to the opinions and advice from her friends and family. Introducing someones mind to different points of views, seeing how options weigh out, and gaining wisdom from others are all ways seeking multiple opinions can help a person make a better choice.",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
BF619ADE9BF4,"One morning, Generic_Name the Pterodactyl hopped outside of his old nest. The nest has been in his family for generations but had started to wear down. The twigs were falling out left and right and they would poke him while he slept. Not to mention that it was located in a dangerous neighborhood. Generic_Name decided it was time to sell the old nest and move into a new one. He asked his pterodactyl friends where to move in. Generic_Name the Pterodactyl said, ""you should move in with me and we could be roommates!"" Generic_Name thought about it, but politely declined his friend's offer for Generic_Name was a messy house keeper and only played video games. He then asked Generic_Name the Pterodactyl who answered with, ""I know a great realtor by the name of Generic_Name the Velociraptor."" Later that day Generic_Name looked up Generic_Name on Boggle, the search engine for dinosaurs, and found that Generic_Name was a pretty sketchy realtor. Finally he asked his good friend Generic_Name the Pterodactyl for advice. Generic_Name was not only a good house keeper, but also knew the Jurassic Area pretty well. He told Generic_Name, ""Make sure to look for nests that are in good neighborhoods and are in good condition."" Generic_Name was a great help, and after many hours of research, Generic_Name was finally able to call another nest home.

Some people often ask for advice from multiple people (or pterodactyls in Generic_Name's case). Seeking multiple opinions on something can help give you clearer and better feedback, and can even help you decide for yourself.

The more trials you have in an experiment, the more accurate your results will be. Let's use Generic_Name for an example. If Generic_Name had only listened to Generic_Name, then he would be up to his ankles in empty potato chip bags and energy drinks. It was because he asked multiple pterodactyls, that he was able to get the right advice. This doesn't mean that Generic_Name was planning on being messy or that Generic_Name was trying to scam Generic_Name. They were just trying to be good friends. From a scientific perspective, when planning a science experiment, you would want to have at least three trials. This is because something out of the ordinary could happen in your first trial and that it usually takes at least three trials to recognize a pattern in the experiment.

If you are asking for advice - don't pick your favorite person. When I say this I mean people like your parents, your boss, etc. Although they could have good opinions, you might listen to them more than the other people who are trying to give you real feedback. Not only that but you don't want to have a person to lie to you and say that there was nothing wrong with your outfit or that your story didn't have confusing plot lines, when they both do. But on the other side of the feedback spectrum, don't pick someone who is going to crush your spirits. I once had a teacher in 6th grade that inspired me to learn more about the world's history and pushed me to learn. I even considered being a historian when I was older. Then, in 7th grade, I got a 72 year-old teacher who instead of having us learn about the Spanish-American War - stopped the whole class to look at pictures of his grandson. Don't get me wrong, I love looking at adorable picture of babies. But during the year, I lost my love for history and never thought about being a historian since. So what I'm trying to say is that you should pick someone you trust and that you respect and know that they will do the same for you.

Although seeking multiple opinions can be helpful, you should also go with your gut on things. Facts101. com says that your gut is right 85% of the time. I've been in the scenario multiple times where I circled an answer on a quiz, but convinced myself that I was wrong and circle another answer. So I turned in my paper when I was done and my teacher graded them. She gave them back and it turned out that I was right the first time! Whenever I need help deciding something I try flipping a coin in the air. Before it lands, I most likely all ready know what I want because I'm hopping for it to land on heads so I can go out with my friends instead of getting a early start on my chemistry project. If you ever need help deciding something try using this trick.

To sum up, seeking advice from multiple pterodactyls - I mean people, can give you better and more honest feedback, and can help you decide for yourself. So don't be afraid to ask for opinions because in the end it might just help you soar .

Lets say you're confused on what to do when doing something, some people may try to figure out what to do by their self, some may also seek advice from others. When asking for an opinion, you're asking other people what they think. After you have gotten your advice, your set! You got an opinion that could possibly help you out. But one isn't always enough, there are loads of people that have different opinions too, one is good, but more is better.

One opinion is a door that has opportunity, but when you ask more people for opinions, it opens more doors with more opportunity. Asking for more than one opinion can be good becuase it can help you with the task at hands. With more than one opinion you can think about how they are helpful and if they are worth paying attention to. Now that you have multiple opinions, you think of which one will help you the most, you will have a bigger idea on things involving the situation. When listening to an opinion, there are details that help support their idea, and sometimes these details are worth paying attention to. What people add along with their opinion can make the room expand giving you more things to explore.

In conclusion, when having trouble with something, asking for someones advice can open up an opportunity. But when you ask for more advice from more people, there are more opportunities to explore and think about. Asking for more opinions will give you a bigger understanding on how or what to do. Opinions are helpful in about every way possible, because they add details that help you with the task at hand.

It is already struggling and old, and putting it down would be better than to have it suffer. It is a sad decision, but you've probably helped it by putting it down, otherwise its last few moments would have been miserable. Seeking your friends advice in that situation helped you make a better decision, and it was the right thing to do.

Imagine you are walking down a hallway in school, and you see a group of kids standing in a circle, shouting. You walk over to see what is happening, and you see your friend beating up the kid who used to bully you. You think to yourself, ""I should go help my friend,"" but then a bystander tells you, ""Hey, maybe you should not beat up the bully. Although he used to hurt you every day, it is not the right thing to do. Instead, you should stop the fight, and help the bully up off the ground."" You say ""That is a ridiculous idea"", but then realize, even though he did use to hurt you, everyone deserves a second chance. You help the bully up, and he asks, ""Why did you help me?"" You say, ""Even though you hurt me, everyone deserves a second chance."" By showing kindness to the bully, you helped him change his ways, and he stopped bullying. Even though you did not ask for the bystander's advice, he helped you make a better decision, and you even helped the bully.

Seeking other people's advice can be helpful. It can help us make better decisions in life, and as we get older, having a trusted friend or two to look to for advice when things get bad, is always a good idea.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
41BFE4156488,"It is important to talk to more then one person. Sometimes people talk to more than one person is because, they might feel the need to want more ideas for what they need help on. My first reason is because,I know that when someone is seeking for help they would go to multiple people, because everyone might have different thoughts on one thing. My second reason is because to find out the solution to your problem is to think but also listen to what other people have to say, the reason is say that is because what they say might be important. sometimes people's advice can really help, but you can't believe everything people say.

One good example for this could be that I asked my friends how I should ask my mom to go to the movies with them, even if I know I'm grounded. All of my friends would give me a good why and idea's to ask, but there was one that didn't really make since. One of them said "" you could just leave the house, it's kind of like sneaking out."" But I didnt really want to do that, because that idea wasn't the best for me, so I decided just ask, and everything went smooth. It's just that simple.

Something a student said that ""sometimes people need advice or help that they are seeking for, people might be ignoring that person. Thats why people do bad things."" The reason that I am bringing this up is because, this is true. Sometimes people actually help, some things can be difficult, and even if you dont think that you need help, you will. Even if it's the littlest amount of it,everyone needs help.

When you feel like you need help, don't be scared to ask some one for a little help every once in a while. Its not hard at all, maybe you would feel a little embarrassed, but don't,everyone makes mistakes and needs help sometimes, its normal. Also it's great to help other people, because they might need help as well, and when you do good things for other people you got good things in return. To ask for some advice, its simple. All you have to do is just to go up to someone you trust and just ask for help, or ask for some ideas.

Sometimes it's better to just go with your gut. Making choices can be hard sometimes, and they can be good or bad choices. thats why you ask, so you dont do something that you will regret, or something that will effect your life. I think that it is better to ask for help then to just go and do something that you know is not good or something that is to hard to do. It might be hard but you can push through that challenge, keep going forward and ask for help as you do that. Don't let others stop you from overcoming that goal or that challenge.

I recommend that you always ask for help, even in at the hardest times. Also make sure that you ask everyone that you can, because everyone is different, and everyone has a different kind of mind set. Thats why it is a good thing, because you can get all of the advice that you need in life. you can keep pushing as you take others advice and use it in the real world. people can sometimes just give up because they that no one to give them some help,and that not good for them.

In conclusion, you just need to ask for a little advice, because you never know what your going to go up against in life, and when you get stuck, just go up to an adult you trust and say "" hey can you help me, i'm little stuck."" That is perfectly fine because, they will help you and give you some great advice, to help you succeed. There is nothing to be scared about. Your going to thank that person for helping you. Your also going to thank yourself for asking for help.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
51E6646E0733,"Why is asking people for their opinions a good thing and how does it sometimes help you make better choices?

Well because sometimes asking people for their opinions is a good thing because you can see who's good for you and who's bad for you,but you can also hear from different opinions. Each person thinks differently and they each have different advice. Some people might think good things are bad and bad things are good. Also sometimes you have friends that try to make you choose the bad choice and some make you choose the right choice. Some people give you good advice and some don't. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because each person gives you different advice, you can see who's good and who's bad, and we each have different opinions.

One reason why seeking different opinions from different people is because when you ask people for their opinion and right away when they give you their opinion you can tell if their bad or good. By the advice that people give you,you can tell if their their giving you good advice or bad advice . I know we all have friends that are good and some that are bad. But your good friends don't always give you good advice. If you ask someone for their opinion and they tell you to do something wrong/bad,then that probably means that their bad and by bad I mean like they don't make the right choice or they make bad decisions.

A second reason why seeking different opinions from different people is because each person gives you different advice. You can go ask someone for their advice and then go ask someone else and they won't say the same thing. For example you can ask your friend what shirt they like better if they like the pink one or the blue one and she says the pink one, but then, you go ask your other friend and she says she likes the blue one. That's what I mean by giving you different advice/ opinion on which one they like better or which one would look good on you. Also asking different people for advice can lead you to making the right choices or making bad decisions.

One last reason why seeking different opinions from different people is because we each have different opinions. Let's say your friends want you to do something bad with them and you don't know if you should do it or not. You go ask your mom and she tells you that in her opinion you shouldn't do it because thats not the right choice,but then, you go ask one of your friends and they tell you that you should go join. That's giving different opinions because your mom's opinion is different from your friends. Everyone's opinion sometimes helps you on what to do or what choices to make.

These three reasons explain how seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices. Each person gives you different advice, we all have different opinions, and you can see who's good and who's bad. This is why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices.       ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
B3541C7B8380,"People ask for advise all the time, but have you ever thought about getting a second opinion?

Not everyone does, and thats something that needs to change.

When I was about ten I fell off my bike and broke my wrist (or so we thought) we went to the doctor and my dad decided to get a 2nd opinion.

The second doctor stated that I had two minor fractures and that I would need a full arm cast not a hand splint. Seeking multiple opinions is a great way to help you make better choices that could affect you emotionally and physically.

A person can have an opinion, but what really is an opinion.

An opinion is a non factual statement that people use in arguments to every day life.

Everyone has their own opinion but when it comes to medical and physical issues the result could be very bad if three people have different opinions.

Thats why most people get 2nd or even 3rd opinions if none of them match up.

You can not only get second opinions in the medical field you can also get them in the emotional field.

When I was in 7th grade a student asked me if he should commit suicide I said no and referred him to the school counselor.

He later thanked me and went to therapy and currently has an A honor roll.

Seeking multiple opinions can be beneficial to your health and others.

The police force has a negotiator who attempts to persuade a suicidal person or a person robbing a bank not to do what they are doing.

This person goes out onto the front line just to give someone their opinion that could save others lives.

The best way to prove someone wrong is to use factual information but when religion or politics come up most facts go down the drain more so in religion.

But you can prove someone wrong just using opinions.

I was recently engaged in an argument about religion with a fellow lunch mate.

He asked me if I believe in an afterlife I promptly said no and then we then went back and forth.

I was contradicting almost every opinion he had with a fact that I either new or had looked up on my phone.

I ended that lunch feeling quite pleased with myself for fact had beat opinion.

Facts can beat opinions but you can not change what someone believes in if they really do believe in it.

That same student approached one of my colleges they have the same opinion that I do and the student is now contradicting what he so desperately needs to believe.

Although seeking multiple opinions is a good thing to do your opinion almost always comes out on top no matter the consequences.

When seeking multiple opinions be sure your checking with someone with experience in the field you want help with.

Getting multiple opinions can be beneficial to you in a physical and emotional way.

If your emotions get in the way of your safety and others seek a first or 2nd opinion.                     ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
C7535D12B057,"There are many different reasons people ask more than one person for advise, one reason is that the person might have a different opinion than the other, the second reason is. You didn`t really trust the person you asked their advise for.

Its always a good thing to have different opinions because,then you can have many options to choose from, with more opinions, the easier it gets, to choose the opinion you think will help you the most. Another reason is that you might not like the advise they gave you because it can`t help with what you`r trying to do. Or it could be bad advise there are giving you, you can tell that their not giving you good advise if you don`t like their opinion or it just sounds like a bad opinion to use. So always make sure you are choosing the advise you think is best for you.

Whenever you go and ask people for their advise make sure you trust the person your asking, if you dont then you could get it trouble, if you follow what they said, for example if someone said to cheat on the test, and then the teacher caches you, then you will be in big trouble. Another reason you should always ask people who you trust, if you ask the people who you trust, it could help you in the future like when your trying to get a job and many other things. The final reason is so that you won`t be in danger when you ask the people you trust, because if you don`t you could get hurt or worse. So always ask the people you trust so you wont be in any danger or get harmed.

So always think about which advise you choose, and who you got the advise from, so you can have the best advise, so it can help you in the long run, and to be safe so you wont get hurt or get into big trouble by your teacher,parents, boss, etc.        ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
B2F7B08EA688,"''When people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more than one person."" I think that the reason why people don't ask only one person for advice is that it gives you a chance picking more than one advice.

The thing I learned is sometimes whne people give you advice some people say it for their own good or either for their own bad. They say it for their own good because that person wants you to make good choices in life. The other people say it for their own bad so they can see you makke bad choices in life and see you not doing well. It's always going to be that good or bad advice to choice from. To make good choices you have to pick the good advice that the person gave you because they said it for their own good.

Not all the time people got the same opinion on things sometimes they have different opinions on the advice. You'll ask different people on advice and you will get either a bad one or a good opinion on the advice. Good opinons for the advice will always end up making you make good chocies in life or the road your walking in. The good opinions is for them to see you doing good things. The good opinions are always the good ones for you to choice from.

The other one is when you ask someone their are always people that got to say something about you. You never know what somebody got to say about the advice your asking for. They might judge you for asking for some type of advice. Some people always got good or bad opinions of you. People would judge for seeing you doing better because you went for a good advice.

A good reason why you should ask a couple people for advice is that you will always end up picking good choices. The more good choices you pick it would cause you walk in a good road. That's why you should ask more than one person to give you great advice. For example, say that you ask one person to give you advice and say that the advice they gave you wasn't great and you can't do noting about it , that's why it is important asking couple people for advice because asking only one person won't be great. That's why people always end up asking more than one person for advice for their own good.\

Lastly people asking for advice they would be expecting a good advice. For example, say that I ask a couple of friends for advice about soccer, I would be expecting a good advice not a bad one. As humans we always expect something great not bad. The people you should be asking for advice would be the ones who already expeirment it while going through it. You can ask someone who didn't went through but they might give you advice but it won't be great one.

In conclusion, it is always a good idea asking more than one person for advice. That would be for your own good and cause you make good choices.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
1135CD7FBE4F,"Have you ever tried to make a decision on whether or not you should do something? Did you ask for others opinions? In most cases of this people don't ask for others opinions because it makes them think that they are very wrong and are afraid of what will happen if they get different views. This could be true but it would also be better to ask for different views because it can sway you away from doing something bad that could change your life forever. This is why more than one view can help you make the right decision, you open your mind to more than one point of view, it can help you ask for others opinions more, and it can help you with your work later in life.

Opening your mind to more than one point of view can help you make the right decision in a few ways, such as being able to hear the consequences of what will happen if you do it. Another way it helps to make the right decision, is that it helps you to see if that is something that you would or if it something someone that you wish you were would do. This means that logically and for your own protection it would benefit you to get more than one point of view.

By getting more than one point of view it can help you to see that asking for peoples' opinions is better. This can help you in many ways, because it can help you to see making decisions by yourself may not always be the logistical thing to do. Another way it helps you, is you see that others have experiences with these things and you can learn from others and the way they see, hear, and interpret things they hear and know. That is why asking for others opinions help you to make better decisions throughout your whole life.

Another reason that having more than one point of view can help, is later in life for work you must be able to hear others opinions and be able to process them to be more successful. With this you must be able to be a good listener which helps when you start off by already being used to hearing other peoples' ideas. It will also help you with work because you will be able to have more experiences when other people ask for your opinion on a topic. Lastly, it helps you be more open to new ideas for your work and other things that will be in your everyday life. This is how it will help in your work later in life.

This is why more than one view can help you make the right decision, you open your mind to more than one point of view, it can help you ask for others opinions more, and it can help you with your work later in life.

F5A0BD46D3AF,"When someone is having a hard time making a decision they might reach out to other people. Those people might have different opinions on your question which can be a very helpful thing to any person. Seeking advice or opinions from multiple people can be helpful because they can be more wise than you, people might have been in your shoes before and asked the same question, and you will be more confident in your decision from being informed by other people's opinions. This can be very beneficial for when you don't know what the better decision is best for you.

My first reason on why this is a good method is people can be wiser than you. People older than you can be very wise and more mature than you. With them being very wise their opinions can lead to you making the right decision. Their advice can also teach you life lessons that will stick with you. They can also reflect off of things that have happened in their past which can also give you advice as well. Wise people might be your parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. People that are wise are a good source for people to ask advice from.

My second reason why seeking multiple opinions is helpful is that some people might have been in the same shoes as you and wanted the same type of advice. These people may also give good advice because they asked for the same type of advice. They could tell you what is true and what is not and could tell you their opinion from the experience he or she went through after their decision. This can also narrow down your decision quickly from knowing the person's experience. People who asked for the same type of advice and opinions can give you good advice from how their own experience.

My final reason is that you will be more confident in your decision from seeking multiple opinions from other people. Using just your own advice to make a decision might not make you feel very confident. You could start second guessing yourself about it or get nervous because you think you made the wrong decision. By talking to other people and getting their opinion makes you feel more confident because multiple people have given you advice that supports your decision. You wanna be confident in your decision because you don't want to feel down about it and think so negatively when you could talk to other people and get advice.

In conclusion seeking multiple opinions can help make a better decision because people can be wiser than you and are more mature, some people might have asked for the same advice and give advice from their experience, and you feel more confident in your answer with multiple people giving you advice that supports your choice. These are reasons can help people make better decisions for them and the people around them. Using other people can helps you in either telling you what is the right decision to make or support you on how you chose the right decision. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
3A83E8B7AB1B,"When you have a problem or ordeal that you cannot deal with by yourself, asking even just one person's opinion is a brave and brilliant thing to do. Oftentimes people tend to keep things to themselves, even if it's affecting them in a horrible way. I think it's important that people remember, well being doesn't just lay on the physical side, but the mental side of things as well. Even just venting in a diary or a journal is a great way to relive yourself of stress and anxiety. My point is that in these situations, talking to others or venting can prove to be quite a serendipitous time.

Now, If you are going to talk to people, it is very important to ask more than one person for their advice on the matter. I think the reason why a lot of people ask around, is because they are unsure of their own opinion on something, and want support and help from others. If you are ever in a situation where you don't agree with someone, reassure yourself by asking other people. If you are ever on the opposite end of this matter make sure to take the person's problem seriously. If your peer or friend feels confident enough to talk to you, you should never crush that confidence or act as though their problems are minuscule and unworthy of your help. It is important to take whatever they say in a non-judgmental way.

Seeking help from not only friends, but adults, is something you should always do. You may feel more comfortable talking to your friends, but unfortunately oftentimes they are not equipped with the right experiences to help you. if you don't feel comfortable talking to your parents or a teacher about your problems, some adults you could talk to could be a counselor or, if you can afford it, a therapist.

Make sure to listen to advice given. I know you may feel that everyone is wrong and that you are right, but if a lot of people are saying the same thing, think about it. Think about why you asked for advice in the first place, oftentimes it because you were unsure about your own opinion, of many other opinions contradict your own there is obviously some room for improvement.

Even though listening to others is important, in the end having your own opinion or decision is even better. Stick to your gut feeling. You'll know when something is right or wrong. You know certain details about your problem that others may not, so in the end you know best. Do whats good for you, if you think you're in a toxic environment, you're probably right. Listen to yourself and develop your own opinion on the matter. Think about what happened, what you are feeling, what will make you feel better. In the end it is most important to take care of and love yourself.

The thing that matters most in this predicament, is that you got help in anyway you could. Even if that help wasn't seeking advice, but venting to yourself, an object, or even animal. The most important thing is that you took care of yourself. Mental health will forever and always be important. Keep in mind that even if something feels really horrible and like it will never get better, it most definitely will. Keep a positive attitude towards things and have faith. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
25C5C068B05E,"People ask for advice for many things that they might struggle with most people are able to help by just giving them their opinions. Some people ask for advice and opinions in topics such as school, work, and sports. It is important and completely healthy to ask for advice or help.

When should you ask people for advice or their opinions? You can ask whenever you might need it or want it. For example in sports, work, and school. you can ask anyone if they ever need advice. With something or someone, and you can help them by just listening or talking to them about it. And mainly try and understand what they're saying or what they mean about it. It can also make them feel more confident and better than they did before. And asking multiple people is also good so that you get more opinions that could help you.

Writing and essay in school can be very stressful and difficult. But you can help someone in school by giving them advice on a essay that they're stressed about or maybe just need some help. Another is taking a test, taking a test is very nerve racking and scary but all you might need to do is just relax take a deep breath and talk to someone and just stay positive. Games in school are fun but someone may need help with a question to get the answer right. If anyone might need help maybe just go over it with them and re-read it so that maybe they can understand and get it quicker, and get the answer right

In work talking to your boss for any reason is very difficult or scary. One because you never know what they might say to you it could be good news or bad news which is always hard. A good topic is getting promoted or something very special at work that could boost your confidence into wanting to keep improving or doing better. Getting a big part at work is also very exciting and you might want to talk to someone about that just if you need a confidence talk on what might be going on in the future at work or who might be there to help guide you through everything that's going on.

In sports learning new things or skills is very hard or maybe it might be easy for you and make you want to keep improving. Pep talks are also a very good way to figure out what coming that your coaches might be preparing you for in the future or before a game or your about to preform. Being nervous is a huge part of playing sports because you never know what might happen or what could happen so all you need to do is stay positive and ready to improve.

Overall it is very important and very good to ask people for advice or opinions so that they have an idea about whats happening and it overall just makes them not as stressed and nervous.

2446D9BE78B8,"Some people do not see the need to spend the effort in questioning multiple people to gather information and opinions, but it is a crucial step in research. They see it as only an extra step that can be skipped over without thought, but in reality, only seeking information from one person leads to incorrect, biased information. Though it takes time, seeking advice from multiple sources allows for more information and different viewpoints, leading to a better outcome.

Different people have different viewpoints and opinions. If you only seek advice from one person, you only see one side of what could happen, rather when you ask multiple sources, you're given a greater sense of what to do and how to go about it. According to the New York Research Center for Populations and Society, on a societal level, nothing but basic morals are agreed on and considered to be universally accepted. What is accepted in the United States may not be considered normal in India, or the other way around. On a smaller scale, this may be less evident, but the research still applies to a great extent. If only one source is questioned, what they see as okay may not be seen the same way by another source. For this reason, it is hard for most people to switch societal views and morals. A study conducted by Generic_Name shows that when people are shown a different viewpoint, they tend to stick with it after being presented a new one later. When you do not get more than one perspective on a matter, you have the tendency to use whatever you were taught to make choices, and not accept changing to a more reliable choice.

Another key reason to gather information from multiple sources is that you do not know the accuracy of the information gathered when only from one person. They may have learned the information incorrectly, which can lead to bad advice. As an example, lets say a new mother was seeking advice on how to raise their child safely. According to the Family and Consumer Science program, 68% of people under the age of 25 do not have antiquate information on how to perform childcare duties. If that mother were to ask one of her unqualified friends, she could be presented with false information. That friend may of thought they were qualified to give information. A second study performed by Generic_Name shows the less qualified people are, to more they tend to think they are qualified. That could mean you are getting advice from an unreliable source, and most likely your course of action will be worse.

A similar reason to seek advice from multiple people is bias. Bias can be hard to detect in many cases, especially when the thing biased to is smaller and less prevalent. Research done by the California Critical Thinking and Development Organization, 72% of people were unable to identify bias in articles. For what seems like such a simple skill, it is surprising in the amount of people who are unable to preform it. Taking to multiple sources makes bias easier to identify, because more conflict will occur in the information. One source may leave out information to angle the evidence, while the other states all the evidence. Even in cases where bias in unavoidable, taking to multiple sources may provide better results. As Generic_Name, a researcher for the University of Oklahoma states, ""Researching biased topics may prove challenging, but combining evidence together to rid the bias is a helpful strategy in reducing the nonfactual information.""

As all evidence suggests, taking advice from multiple people is the right course of action to receive the best information. When people only take advice from one person, they allow for many mistakes and mishaps. Next time you are trying to make a decision that will have the best outcome, rather than only asking for advice from one person, take advice from multiple and gather as much information about the topic as possible. The more information you have, the more likely you are to make the correct choice.",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
97AD49AE2944,"Could you imagine only having one person to ask all your advice and questions to? I don't think I could ever imagine that because I believe that seeking multiple opinions for advice can best help a person to make the best choice.

When I get multiple opinions I can get a different point of view on my choices, I can make sure the choice I am making is the best choice by learning from other people, and it makes me more open minded to things I haven't tired before. I do think that you also shouldn't just get your opinion from anyone, especially in today's society with social media, but I do think that having multiple opinions to come back to is truly important.

When I get multiple opinions for advice I can get a different outlook and perspective of my own opinion at hand. I think that if I only asked the same person for advice I would become small minded and my actions would reflect that. My choices would always be influenced by that person and I would lack understanding of others. It also makes me realize things I never knew. For example, when I was doing course selections for high school this year I did not know what science class to take. The county and my science teacher do not support taking biology in freshman year; I, however, asked a friend of mine in high school what it was like since she was taking the class freshman year. She told me that it was not impossible, but just a lot of work you need to be committed to do. I am glad that I got another opinion from her because It helps me to realize that it isn't an impossible course to take which my teacher made me believe. I think getting different advice also gives you a diverse point of view of people and their lives. Another example I have is about my grandma. My grandparents grew up during a war and have different opinions on things than others. One thing my grandma hates to do is waste food. Always growing up I knew that I shouldn't waste food and if I was ever getting rid of old food, I should do it when grandma's not home. While at school though I notice that there are people who waste food and it's normal for them. The different opinions of people affect their values and lifestyle and I think it is important to understand them.

Getting multiple opinions can help you to verify your choice is the best one. When I'm making a difficult choice I usually seek advice from those close to me. For example, when I was deciding whether or not to apply to TJ my mom's opinion was absolutely yes. I felt that this was my only choice until I told my grandma. My grandma told me that when my mom had went to TJ she had constantly been stressed. My grandma said that she did not want to push me to go to TJ and only go If I wanted to. Having more than my mom's advice was useful when I did end up deciding to apply because it made me aware of the choice I was making. When you get multiple opinions it bring up things you may have overlooked. When a doctor has a patient who has an issue that they are not sure what it is or the best way to treat them, they'll get a second opinion.

Getting a second opinion from another doctor can help get the patient the best treatment for their particular situation or condition. One person alone could look over minor details that another person would not. My last point is that you may find the answer you were truly looking for. When my mom was looking into getting new floors, she did not just get one opinion. She went around and got different advice on the type of wood, style and color. She got multiple opinions until she got the choice that she truly loved and was happy with. I believe that getting different opinions can help to solidify the choice you are making as the best one you could choose.

Getting more than one opinion makes you more open minded to things you haven't tried before. An example I have is when I went shopping with my friends. While we were shopping we picked out outfits for each other. I got to try on stuff I never would have chosen on my own or with my sister. I found things I absolutely loved that I would not have tried without their advice. When you get different opinions you also widen your option of choices to choose from. Five years ago when my family was getting my current dog, we went looking on pet websites. There was a pet store we always went to and decided to maybe get a puppy from there. It wasn't until we found out from our friends who had got a puppy from there that many dogs from that store get sick. It was basically a puppy mill. My mom went and found reviews for the store online. She found a review that said a certain breeding place in Maryland was the place to go instead. Taking that lady's advice we drove down to Maryland and got my dog who is still with me today. She is one of the best choices I have ever made and i'm grateful that we found her. I don't think that we would have went to this specific breeder without the advice from reviews and our friends. Getting different opinions can affect even more simple things in daily life. My example is ordering off a menu. As I get older, instead of just ordering the things my parents tell me to get, I may ask the waiter or a person who goes there often for their opinion on the best stuff there. This gets me to try new things and makes my meals more fun. Getting different opinions gives you more variety in life based on others' life experience.

All in all, I still think that getting multiple opinions on different advice can help someone to make the best choice possible. When I seek different opinions I can get a different view on the topic, it makes me sure my choice is the best one by learning from others' stories and opinions. It also makes me more prone to trying new things. I think that you should always get advice from different people because they all have different experiences in life. I know that even in the future I will still want to have different opinions to be able to reflect and learn from.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
745F880CEFA7,When someone is asking for advice they might talk to more than one person because someone might have better advice than someone else or might have better and more advice than somebody else. I think people ask multiple people because the person who is asking for advice wants the most advice and best information and opinions from others. Another reason why someone might ask multiple for advice is that everybody has different experiences throughout their lifetime and might know more stuff because of those experiences throughout their lifetime. People might ask the elderly for advice because their wise and have lived a long life so they might know alot of information to pass on. Everybody has different opinions but hearing different opinions from others can help you make a better choice. I think you should ask your parents for advice first before you ask anybody else for advice because your parents are the one the ones who raised you and they know what's best for you. For example your parents probably told you when you were little to not to talk to strangers because they know its the best for you. Your parents also might have told you that to always tell the truth because its not good to lie. By asking alot of people for advice and hearing other peoples opinions and experiences throughout their lifetime you now know alot of information and advice from others with that you can make a better choices.,3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
60F9BE7AF29C,"Majority of people only go to one friend when they are in need of advice. But actually, asking multiple people for help is a better option. First off, everyone has a different point of view or opinion. Second, everybody has had different life experiences. Lastly, to have reassurance that your source is liable. To conclude, hearing more than one friends' advice is a more reliable and trustworthy than only hearing a single person's opinion.

First, everyone has their own opinion. Your opinion is what makes your advice personable. As an example, someone may ask you whether they should help their friend or not. They could go to one friend who will only give their opinion or you could go to multiple people who will give you both sides so you can make the decision for yourself. With multiple opinions, you will get to have all the information to make your final say.

Second, everbody comes from a different experiences or opportunities. They have all had their own past experiences which weighs in on their advice. For example, if you ask two people if you should go skydiving who have done it before, they might have different sides on it because of their experience.

One person could have had a near death experiece, so they would reccomend you did not go. While, the other person could have had so much fun and would reccomend. This gives you a variety of answers and can even help you on the little things such as where to go, who to ask for, etc.

Lastly, to make sure that the first person is trustworthy. People can be unreliable for numerous reasons. For instance, Generic_Name and Generic_Name going up for the same promotion. Generic_Name asks Generic_Name for advice to get the promotion. Generic_Name could sabatage him so he gets the promotion. If multiple people say the same advice as Generic_Name time and time again, then Generic_Name is probably trying to help him get it. Having lots of people tell you advice is a great way to cofirm your first opinion.

In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice is better than asking a single person for help. This is because everyone has had different experiences, have different opinions, and to just confirm the source's advice is liable. From now on, when you have a problem, you should get many of your friends' input.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
0B998187123D,"Have you ever been making a decision and didn't know who to ask for advice? Well the best option is to ask multiple people. Most people make a decision after asking only one person for advice, but when you ask multiple people you're more likely to make a better choice. Asking multiple people for advice and getting different opinions is good because you can think about all the factors, you will have options rather then having one person tell you what to do, and lastly if everyone gives you the same advice its probably the best option to choose.

The first reason I believe talking to more then one person about advice is better for making choices, is that you will have options rather then having one person tell you what to do. When you only take advice from one person it can be bias as to where when you get multiple opinions you see both sides. For example lets say you were thinking about getting a dog your friends would say something like ""Yes you should get a dog they're so cute."" but your mom might say ""They are a lot of work and responsibility."" so when you ask different people you get to see both sides of a situation.

The second reason I think asking multiple people for advice is you get a bunch of different opinions. Like lets say you aren't sure if you want to be friends with someone anymore one person you ask might say ""You should just cut them off completely."" but maybe someone else might say ""You dot have to stop being friends with them just maybe dont hang out as much.""

With both of these answers in mind you have options to choose from when making a decision.

The final reason I believe that asking many people for opinions is better for making choices is when more people say the same the greater the chance of it being a good choice. For example when you are trying to choose between two things like what to get for lunch a salad or a sandwich and the majority of people are saying sandwich thats probably the one you should get.

In conclusion asking multiple people for advice and getting many opinions back is good because you can think about all the different factors, you will have options rather then having one person tell you what to do, and finally if everyone is saying the same thing its probably a good choice to make. If you are ever struggling to make a decision its better to have multiple people weigh in on the situation rather than just one.   ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

For example if you asked five friends what day it is and four of them say monday you can conclude that it is monday. However there is always a chance that all four of your friends are wrong, to make sure the responses you get are correct it is important to ask more poeple. This idea of proving information with repeated results is even used in science. Scientist have to repeat experiments multiple times over to make sure that the results they get are consistant. The thing is, not every question has a right or wrong answer. A lot of the time people ask for others opinions or advice, when asking for other peoples opinion it is also very important that you ask multiple people. The reason for this is becuase everybody has different point of views on the same topic. When asking for an opinion it is good to know multiple point of views so that you can make the best conclusion.

Asking multiple people the same question does not only apply to when you talk with others but it can also teach you many important skills in life. For example if I am looking something up on the web it is important to be in the habbit of looking throung multiple sources. In life it is extremely important to pull information from multiple sources becuase it gives you more insight on the topic. For this reason it is super important to ask more than one person for advice.

asking more than one person for their opinion not only gives you a more educated conclusion, but it's a way to get to know people better.

People might not know it, but when they ask other people for their opinion or advice they are actually getting to know them better.

Taking the time to ask multiple people when you have a question can be very benificial becuase it will get you the most educated conclusion.

709EF21B80F2,"Everyone is different. The experiences people have and genes they get are all different. People often have varying cultures, beliefs, and backgrounds. This diversity, however, can be used to an advantage by seeking out many different people when it come to advice. It is important to ask multiple people for advice because people often have multiple opinions, different experiences, and different perspectives on looking at things.

First and foremost, it is important to ask multiple people for advice because people often have multiple opinions and ideas for what to do. For example, one time I was fencing and my next bout was against a tough opponent. The opponent's skill was far beyond mine, however, if I learned how he fenced and how to counter him, I might be able to beat him. I asked many different people about how to counter him and they all told me different things. Even though everyone told me something different, I could use this knowledge to my advantage and combine my knowledge about him in the past to formulate a plan and act on it. In the end, I won all my bouts and ended up winning the tournament. This shows that even though multiple people may have good advice on what to do, the wisdom of the crowd is ultimately the best option. This means that combined, many people together is smarter than any one person, and this will help a person get better advice.

In addition, it is important to multiple people for advice because different people have different experiences on what to do. Some people went through the exact same problem, so they may have better advice than those who have never been through it. They also might have an idea that has not been thought of by me, but will easily solve the problem. Due to their experiences, people only think a certain way, and somebody might have a way that is perfect for this problem. Advice comes in many different ways, and different people have different strategies for succeeding in life. What will work for one person may not work for another, which is why people need different advice. For example, quotes are a type of advice, however they are written by countless different people. The different experiences of people can guide them to look at things differently which leads to my final point.

It is important to ask multiple people for advice because people have different perspectives on looking at things. Throughout a person's lifetime, they have experienced many different things, and learned from those experiences. Everyone has different experiences, and a different perspective to things. This way, asking different people for advice would help that person get a different outlook on the problem, and a different perspective on the problem. This will help them understand the full problem. It is also important to get an understanding of the way other people think. Different people think in different ways, so even if nobody comes up with advice on the problem, the way they think could inspire another person to come up with a solution to the problem.

In conclusion, it is important to ask many different people for advice because people have different ideas, experiences, and perspectives. America is a diverse country, and that is what makes it strong. The diversity of people is something to take advantage of, not ignore, and different people produce different advice. In America, people are luckier than most, because of the vastly different cultures, backgrounds, and beliefs. The tools are there for people to use if they chose to do so.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
A9C32291F224,"Seeking for advice is like learning how to ride a bike because they both require help from other people . If I had a choice, I would want multiple to give me advice for that certain situation. Some reasons for why I think seeking for other opinions is very important are it can give you a wide range of options when trying to find advice, It will allow you to understand the other persons experiences when asking for advice, and looking for other opinions can give you a variety of different answers so you can make better choices.

The first reason for why I think asking people for advice will help a person make better choice is when you ask all of those people for some advice is when you ask all of those people their all going to respond with their own opinions. Finding multiple people for advice can give someone a big boost of confidence on their choices. This is important because you never know the situation that person is in, and your opinion can make a difference. Sometimes its best to respond with a negative or a positive response depending on the advice their asking for. For example, If your best friend walks uo to you and says "" yo man, can I have some advice on how to run faster,"" you would probably respond with a helpful response.

Secondly, It will allow you to understand the other persons experiences when asking for advice. When you go around looking for help and talking to people you start to understand them. What Im trying to say is that when they're sharing their advice with you, their basically just sharing their own experiences with you. Thats why asking different people people is so important because your going to get a different picture every time. To give you an example, my brother and I once went zip lining before, and we had no clue what we were doing. so we asked for some advice from our mom. She told us a lot of crazy nonsense that would probably end up making us choose a bad choice. After that we decided to ask someone we thought had a lot more experience. We ended up asking the zip line instructor, and he gave us a hole bunch of factual information that lead us to make a better choice.

Lastly, looking for other opinions can give you a variety of answers so you can make better choices. Being able to make a choice that can affect you your life in a bad or good way can be very essential to your life. Ways to prevent you from making those bad choices can be as simple as someone for advice. Depending on the circumstance, you would want to ask different people. If I was in a situation that involved school, I would most likely ask my teacher. All of these situations that you have will also have a match to it for example, If your struggling to loose weight, you would probably ask your doctor for some advice, If you needed extra practice with a sports, you would ask your coach. These examples all add up. They all require just a little bit of help.

To sum everything up, I feel like asking for advice in many different ways can really help you out when trying to an answer to something. Hopefully now you can take some of the ways that I expressed, and use them in every day life. Another thing to remember is that a person or whatever your using to get advice can make an impact on your choice, whether its in a good or bad way. The last thing I have to say is to remember to not let another person decide your outcome unless you feel confident about their answer.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
0EBE92AFBD97,"When you need advice on something do you ask multiple people?

When I need advice on something I ask multiple people so I can see their side and see what they did when they were young like me. For example when I asked my mom on advice about going to high school she didn't really give me good advice so I went over to my older brother and told him to give me some advice for high school.

When you ask more than one person you will get different answers. Those other answers could help you with something one day. Like for example my brother was saying that it isn't to hard.

Talking to more than one person could help because your getting different ideas and you could talk to different people and they will have different advice. A lot of people go to more than one person so they could get there advice and how they did it from their side.

So in all I think you should go to more than one person because they will give you their ideas and what you should do and it could help you out a lot.                                                                                                                                                                                          ",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
D98F3E1DE828,"When you are faced with a problem or a situation that you have to decide what to do, how do you pick the right choice? Would you come up with one your self and just choose that or would you have an idea but seek others opinions first before acting. Whichever one you are, Im here to tell you the advantages of seeking others opinions first before acting out.

The first thing your wondering might be why seeking others opinion's helps. Well you would get more opinions of something that your unsure about. You could also get feedback on your choice to truly decide if it is right or not. But if we are talking about getting others opinions in writing than, they could see errors and spelling problems that maybe you don't catch or the computer doesn't catch. Finally, to appeal to more people, you could tweak your writing based on other people's opinions to include more thoughts.

The outcome of receiving other opinions towards your actions are, you'll be more reflective and relate able towards other people. Meaning, you'll be able to agree and converse about more topics rather than just being self centered. Your writing includes multiple ideas and personalities in your writing. Lastly, your choices are changed based on other people because you will think, what would so and so think if they were in my shoes right now.

Your mental and physical health also are affected by the opinions of others. For instance, when deciding in the future you will lean to other people or think about what someone else would do before deciding what is right. When talking about more physical health rather than mental health, you will act more considerately and thoughtful around others instead of selfishly.

The affects of this could be that your taking in others ideas so you will tend to consider them in similar incidents when you have to choose either the right or the wrong. You might also act more thoughtful too others because you learn their opinions which might change your overall mindset. All of this leading too you being a better person in general and giving you a thoughtful and more considerate mindset rather than a selfish and self-centered one. So the take away is that it doesn't take much to broaden your mindset and make you a better person, you just need to think of others maybe a little more than you used too.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
2E2C996BBE7D,"When people today ask for advice, it's usually for a decision they're going to make. Some people today ask for advice so they can have a better understanding of what to do in the situation. Seeking multiple opinions helps a person make a better choice because you will have ideas to pick from, understand the situation, and it could help future choices.

One reason why seeking opinions help is because you can have multiple ideas to pick from. When you seek for different opinions, some of those ideas will be good, and some ideas will match each other. It's better because some of those ideas would be good for the situation you're in. For example, when my old friend needed help with a family situation, she asked other people for their advice for help,then she ended up using her friends ideas and resolving the situation.

Another reason for why seeking opinions is better is because you can have a better understanding of the situation. When asking for opinions from others, you may be asking them the wrong question. But when you tell people your situation, people will understand and explain the right thing to do in your case. For example, my sisters' friend broke up with her boyfriend because she didn't understand the situation enough to get the right Intel on what to do.

The last reason seeking opinions from others help is because it can help benefit your future. If you are in a bad situation and your friends help you get out of it, you can better yourself, learn from it, and try not to get into the situation again. For example, after my best friend stopped talking with her mean friend, she learned from her mistakes, bettered herself, and now she is more careful on who she befriends.

E8FF0D2483FE,"Most of us, as human beings, need other's help for certain things. Whether that be for school work or friendship advises, we all need someone's help at least once in our lives. When we are uncertain of something, we often times ask for help from the people around us. Having multiple people to ask and consult with is a great idea rather than just having one. Seeking help from multiple people can have great benefits, such as having different opinions to build your own opinion, having different experiences from a variety of people to understand the situation clearer, and it's always better to have multiple people to rely on.

Our opinions are shaped by other's opinions through out our lives. In order to build an opinion to take action or maybe to just keep it to ourselves, we must learn new angles and learn new opinions. Just as if it was math, the current knowledge is to be built on prior knowledge, it's no different for having an opinion. We are heavily influenced by the people around us, such as our parents or friends. When we combine the opinions of others on a situation, we can gather them up to make one solution. It's like adding pieces of a puzzle to make one grand masterpiece, we add the opinions of others to make our own opinion. There are multiple times when I have an opinion on something, such as a hobby, person, or situation and when other's share their opinions on it, sometimes I learn new things from them! It opens up a door to a new way of thinking and makes me more open minded. Asking for other's advises to build your own thought is a great way to learn what other's think and to also have a reliable idea.

People often say to ask advice from your parents or any adults around you because they're older. They're older so they have more experience which can come in handy. Having anyone that has gone through the same or a similar situation as yourself can help you avoid other mistakes or help you out in a situation in general. It's a wise idea to ask for advice or the opinions of others who have more experience in whatever you need help with. It's more likely you're going to go ask a math teacher for your math homework rather than your English teacher. It's just a good idea to ask someone for help for something when that person knows something about the topic. Even if you do know about the matter, it doesn't hurt to get more insight about it!

It's always better to stay safe than to say sorry. When people are in a tough situation, it's always good to have people behind you. Getting the opinions of others gives you multiple people to turn to in case you need them. It's similar to writing a research paper since you should get multiple sources to research from to make sure your information is reliable. It's a reassuring feeling to know that you have people who agree with you and perhaps even have that feeling that you're right in certain situations. It's always a good idea to get other's words because you have more information to go off of and also because it's just reassuring!

It's a great idea to talk to multiple people about something that is bothering you or you are curious about rather than one. It doesn't hurt to ask for other's opinions and it's always a good thing to do at the end. We can achieve something or resolve the problem better if we get the help of others. Someone's opinion may shape your own opinion in a totally different way and it's smart to understand and use other's knowledge to your ability. Seeking help from multiple people can have great benefits such as having different opinions to build your own opinion, different experiences to build more knowledge, and also because it's always good to have people to rely on. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
4885E69D7C24,"Have you ever asked for advice or opinions from a variety people? I know I always ask a multiple people for advice. I get opinions and advice from my friends and family on many different things like outfits and school. Asking for multiple people's advice is often the best choice because you then have multiple perspectives, honest opinions, and you can go off on what the majority of people say.

The first reason asking a variety of people for their advice could be that you would receive multiple perspectives. For instance you will get different opinions from each person you ask advice from. They'll tell you what they think you should fix or do and they can also help you decide on something and how to get through obstacles. An example of getting multiple perspectives could be that your struggling to tell if an outfit looks good, so you send a picture to your friends asking what they think and then they give their opinions.

The second reason asking multiple people for their advice is for their honest opinions. When you ask for advice people are almost always going to tell you exactly what they think. Therefore people will help you to not make a fool of yourself, and tell you their opinion on whether something is good or not and if they believe what your doing or about to do is the right choice. An example of honest opinions is, your debating whether you should skip class or not, so you ask your two friends and while one says yes the other tells you not to and explains why its bad to skip.

The final reason asking others for their advice is the best choice is because you base your final decision off of the majority of what people say. Majority is useful when asking for advice from a group of people because it helps you have a clearer image of what you need to do and it helps you see how many people stated the same or different opinion. For example if you have 3 friends and you ask them all what color shirt you should wear and two of them say blue and one says pink, your going to go with the blue shirt because more people advised that you wear the blue shirt.

In conclusion, asking a variety of people for their advice is better because it helps you get honest opinions, multiple perspectives, and a final decision based off of the majority of what people say. People should always ask for advice because it helps take off pressure and it can help them to live a calmer and more sure life. Sometimes people try to do things all by themselves but in reality if they just ask for help or a little bit of advice from others they can save themselves from some stress and anxiety. It's also nice to ask others for their opinions because it makes them feel like you care about what they have to say. So therefore asking advice from a variety of people is the best decision.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

They agree your making the wrong decision and explain to you why they think that. after hearing what they have to say you realize they were right. You end up making the decision that was right. when you see other peoples point of view it can be really helpful. sometimes when you listen you can learn a lot. It is important to talk to others when needing help in making a decision.

Sometimes, you have to make tough decisions. But after taking a survey blue ridge middle school, a school for advanced learners, found that after talking to more than one friend 78% of their students were found to make the right decision. This shows that your friends, if they are a good friends, will almost always help you make the right decision, or will at least try. This is really important and matters because if we are good friends then we can help a friend make a better decision and that will probably boost our confidence to. If each person tries to make better decisions and help others make better decisions the whole world can try to make better decisions.

Now I do understand that we can never be perfect and we can never all make the right decisions ,but we can all try our hardest to. If we try our hardest to make the right decisions we can feel great about our selves and be great people.

If you talk to more than one friend you can have support after the decision happens. Generic_Name stated in her book Decisions, New York Times best seller, that "" When you make the wrong decision,sometimes you just need your friends there for the mountain you have to climb after."" this is really important because we really do need our friends there when we make the wrong decision. They really help us by supporting us with everything we do. When we support our friends we gain stronger friends. when you have a strong friendship then you can help each other make good decisions.

When you talk to more than one person you get more points of view and more chances to make the right decision. Sources of Strength, a well known company that focuses on making kids good people, did a survey and found that 90% of the time people will go towards making the right decision rather then making the wrong one. This is really important because it shows that ,most of the time, when you ask more then one person for help you have a better chance of one of them telling you to make the right decision.

to conclude when you ask more then one person for help in make a decision then you gain many things including, trust, the right decision, and better friends. Talking to others when making important decisions is very helpful. So next time you need help in making a decision dont be scared to go ask your friend for help.

61398AE8B2EE,"Have you ever had an issue and sought for advice from multiple people?

Sometimes asking more than one person can have a bad outcome but i'm going to be talking about the good ones.

I think that asking multiple people can cause good things for example reassurance, or it can help you think more about the situation, and help you be more independent.

When you are asking someone for advice and you are not quite sure of what to do then you could try asking another friend and they could have the same answer that the first person did and it is very reassuring. For example if you are really upset because you and your friend got into a fight and you dont want to fight with them then you could just ask someone on what you should do and whatever they tell you then you could go ask someone else and if they come to the same conclusion as the other person then you will feel reassured and will follow with that advice. However there is an disadvantage in that if the people you ask come to different conclusions then it can cause you more confusion.

I think that if you get more than one piece of advice that is different then you could be very confused and it can make the situation worse. Sometimes it can really help for example when you get the information back and it is different then it can make you think more about what to do in that situation and what you can do to make things easier on yourself. Sometimes it really can be hard through personal experience if you feel like one of the two different options if better then you are really going to want to choose that one but you really need to think about your actions before you make a mistake.

Everyone has had a conflict that they need help with solving. When you need help you should go to the closest people to you because they know you more than anyone. After you ask them you should take that information and really just think about what to do next. Once youve decided on what you want to do then you can make a plan on what you are doing and execute it. Sometimes you can solve problems on your own though but sometimes you equally need a couple friends there to ask for help in times of need.

In conclusion I think that asking more than one person for advice can be very useful and helpful.

A2E4B3830DCB,"When fixing a problem or making a hard decision, asking for advice on how to face it can almost always help with finding the best solution. However, when you need advice on something, one person's opinion won't do. You should always ask multiple people for their opinion.

More opinions will give you a bigger variety of options to choose from which increase the chance of finding the solution that will benefit you the most. Having different opinions might show you the pros and cons of each option and can help you make a smarter decision. Listening to more advice from different people will also tell you which tactic helped other people the most and is then very likely to help you. When you only ask for one opinion you don't know if what they suggest is going to help you the most or even help you at all. It is also important that you seek opinions from people who have different beliefs and think in different ways as asking people who think the same will probably tell you similar answers and won't give you an opposing view that will help you find a decision that you like. Lastly, it's okay to ask people who are biased toward one choice, but make sure that you always get other view points so that you aren't persuaded to make a decision you will regret.

When looking for advice, you should ask multiple people for their opinion. With more opinions you have a larger chance of finding the most effective solution. You can also use the pros and cons to help you decide on the best solution. Using the best advice you can now make the smartest choice on your issue and if you ever face it again.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
D735AC2E844F,"Do you ask many people for advice before making a decision? When given two choices, most people know right away what they should choose to do. However, often times they have trouble fighting with their inner voice that tells them to choose an option that is strictly opinionated. Making big decisions can be very difficult sometimes if you are struggling to distinguish right from wrong. However, the decision-making process could be made so much easier if you intake advice from your trusted peers. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can seek the advice of trusted people that will help you make the right choice, you can weigh out all of your options together, and your mentors can steer you away from making bad choices.

First of all, you can seek the advice of trusted people that will help you make the right choice. This is an amazing benefit of asking people for advice, because your support system can step up and lead you in the right direction. Your support system is your gateway to success. They push you into making decisions that will not only benefit you in the moment, but long term as well. A quote states, ""Your actions speak louder than words."" In the end, all of the decisions that you make pile up as small actions that reach milestones. This is why you should always seek opinions from others, as it generally builds your character, and shapes you into the person that inspires those who need to make the same decisions that you are facing in that exact moment.

Additionally, you can weigh out all of your options together. Again, you are often fully aware of the right choice that you need to make, but it can be hard to tune out all of your opinions in your head as well. When in doubt, sit down with a friend or with your family, and make a pro's/ con's list. This can really exhibit the power that your true instincts have. You would be surprised at how good your trusted peers support you, and will help you sort right from wrong. This is always a good way to ensure that you make the right decision, as you are literally picking apart every option to find out what's best for you. I make pro's/con's lists quite often, as it truly shows reality versus bias.

Lastly, you can be steered away from making bad choices. For instance, you could be given a scenario that causes you to pick one choice from another. You know the right choice, but you find that you really desire to act out of character, and you want to pick the wrong choice. However, you sit down with a friend, and you realize how far you drifted from your path, as they discuss what you would truly benefit from. You should be grateful for this, because just one choice that you make can and will impact your entire life. So, every time that you need to make a grand decision, you should definitely gather multiple people's opinions, as it molds you into the human that you are, or the one that you want to become.

In conclusion, you should always ask people for advice no matter if you are 100% sure on your decision, or not. Because you can be steered away from making bad choices, you can weigh out all of your options together, and you can seek the help of trusted people that will help you make the right choice, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. In life, we are given limitless opportunities that get thrown at us with decisions to go along with them. So, why not painlessly discuss all of your options, and make the choice that gets you where you want to be in the end? Like they say, ""Baby steps."" All of the actions that you do in your life are like ""baby steps"" that are climbing up a long, tall, endless mountain that is frankly the person that you are even when no one is watching.            ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
9F516900789A,"Imagine going to a friend for advice and your friend unknowingly gives you horrible advice and you make a bad decision! One decision can change your life and if it's really important that you are right. This is why you should go to multiple people for advice, so you don't make the wrong choice. If you make a bad choice it hurts you not them, so you need to make sure you make the right decision. I think you should get multiple peoples advice before acting on something because people have different opining's, some people just give bad advice, and some people you just can't trust.

The first reason you should ask multiple people for advice is because people have different opining's. Sometimes there isn't a clear right or wrong choice and it just all comes down to what different people believe. If you only go to one person they will only share their opining which is only half the story. This is why it's important to get multiple peoples advice because you need both sides of the story to make a good decision for yourself.

My second reason you should go to multiple people for advice is that some people give bad advice. Some of the people you will talk to will not know what there talking about. They will give you bad advice that when you act on will hurt you one way or another. That's why it's important to go to multiple people because if the first person you talk to gives you bad advice the second person will clear things up. I know this from experience because I once went to my brother for advice, but when I told my mom what his advice was she told me how wrong it was and what the right choice was.

My last reason you should go to multiple people for advice is because theres some people you just can't trust. As much as you want to deny it they're people in this world that wish you harm and want you to fail either to help them or to make them feel good. One way they try to do this is by giving you bad advice and if you don't go to multiple people you will take there bad advice. Remember one bad choice can change your life, so taking that person advice can even send you to jail.

You should ask for multiple peoples opining because people think differently, some people don't give good advice, and there are some people that want you to fail. So the next time you need advice make sure you go to multiple people. If you don't and you make the wrong decision you can get in trouble, mess up a relationship with someone, and even ruin your life.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
3EA0DEDD2612,"""You should block her on everything and never talk to her again"", Generic_Name told Generic_Name. Furiously in anger, Generic_Name did as Generic_Name told her what was best to do and blocked Generic_Name, Generic_Name and Generic_Name had been best friends, but Generic_Name had just found out that Generic_Name wasn't taking her to Florida for spring break which they had planned on since forever. The next day came and while Generic_Name was headed to class Generic_Name came up to her, ""Hey, it says that you blocked me I was"", Generic_Name stared at her full with rage and walked off before Generic_Name could finish. Generic_Name knew Generic_Name was coming up to her to ask for forgiveness but Generic_Name wasn't going to forgive her, nor talk to her. As days went on Generic_Name ignored Generic_Name, but Generic_Name didn't even comprehend what she had done wrong for this to happen. ""I don't know why she's ignoring me and I really want to know what I did wrong so I could fix it, so could you guys go talk to her for me?"" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name and Generic_Name, ""Sure we'll go ask her"",they walked towards Generic_Name, ""Hey Generic_Name"" Generic_Name said, ""how have you've been?"" ""Awful"", Generic_Name answered. Generic_Name glanced at Generic_Name, ""Oh why is that?'' Generic_Name finally asked, ""Generic_Name isn't taking me to Florida, and instead is taking Generic_Name when in reality Generic_Name and I have been planning on going to Florida since forever!"" Generic_Name exclaimed. ""Oh is this why you've been ignoring her?"" Generic_Name asked while sitting besides Generic_Name, ""Yes and it seems as if she doesn't even care"", Generic_Name answered. ""Well maybe it's because you've been ignoring her, in reality she doesn't know what she did wrong, instead of ignoring her you should talk it out with her"",Generic_Name advised Generic_Name, the two girls got up and went back where Generic_Name was, while Generic_Name sat there she realized that she was the one who messed up. Instead of ignoring Generic_Name she should've discussed the situation with her, she realized that Generic_Name's advice wasn't the best and she should've went to more people for advice. It is best when you ask multiple people for advice rather than only asking one because it gives you multiple choices, same situations, and an overview on the situation

First off, a benefit in asking multiple people for advice is them giving you a variety of choices to pick from. For instance, Generic_Name had snuck out and while he was out having a fun time, he fell from a high distance and broke his arm. He had to come up with a way to tell his parents without telling them what really happened so he went to his friends for advice, they gave him various situations now he could now choose because he knew that if one didn't work the other one had too. This is useful because if he had just asked one of his friends their plan could've backfired. Another example, Generic_Name didn't want to go out, so she asked her friends what to do so she could convince her parents not to take her out. Her friends came up with a bunch of ideas,now she could do all of them until her parents let her stay home. Unlike if she would've asked one person, and they reply with say you don't feel good her parents still would've taken her because it isn't creative as the others. So when asking more people for advice it gives you multiple options to choose from.

Next, asking multiple people lets you find others that have gone through the same situation as you and figure what is best to do. For example, Generic_Name had just gotten into an argument with her friend and didn't know what to do, when she asked her friend Generic_Name for advice she told her that she had once gotten into an argument with the same person as Generic_Name so she let her know what to do. With that advice Generic_Name's problem was now solved. Another case, in where this happened is when Generic_Name got dumped by her boyfriend she was overcome with sadness, but she didn't want to stay like this she knew a lot of her friends had been through this exact situation she went to them for advice they gave her amazing advice that helped her overcome her dilemma. Now if she had gone with someone that hadn't gone through a breakup their advice wouldn't have been as effective. So going for multiple people for advice lets you meet people that have gone through the same situation.

Finally, when going to multiple people for advice they will most often give you the same ideas and it gives you an overview of what you need to do, especially if you're not controlled at the time you won't do anything you shouldn't. For instance, Generic_Name had found out her friend had been telling everyone secrets Generic_Name trusted her with. She went to go ask for advice and everyone had maintained the concept of talking to her and trying to resolve what had happened. Even though she was furious at how her friend had done that to her she didn't go around doing the same thing she had done to her because her outlook on this situation was trying to resolve the problem. Another time, is when Generic_Name was failing one of his classes and he had a big test that would count as half of his grade he didn't know what to do because if he failed this test he was definitely going to fail this class. Going to ask his friends they told him to study and get help from his teacher, so that is what he did instead of cheating since at the time it felt like the only way to get out of this problem but now his overlook on this situation was studying and getting help on what he needed to get better at to pass his test. So when asking multiple people for advice it gives you an overview on the sitution and helps you control yourself.

Generic_Name went to go ask her friends on what to do with Generic_Name, as she had found out she was taking Generic_Name with her to Florida instead of her which had been the original plan. ""Talk to her and check if she is actually taking Generic_Name before anything"", Generic_Name said. ""Don't do anything you'll regret later so just try to resolve it"", Generic_Name said, everyone she had asked kept the same concept of making sure she was taking Generic_Name and talking to her and trying to resolve the problem. Generic_Name resolved it,that's why taking advice from multiple people is best.       ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
579C38EE157B,"Things are not always as they appear. This phrase means that you can't always take the first opinion off of something, and rely on it to be correct. This can relate on multiple things. The main one being that you shouldn't take one opinion for something. You should take multiple opinions on the topic. This is so you can get the full range of information out. The pros and cons of this concept.

This is almost as if you were planning on going sky diving. You are unsure so you go and ask someone. They have no sky diving experience, and are afraid of heights, but you do not know that. So you ask them a few questions about it and they say you should not go. So you take there opinion and don't go.

Then if you were to take multiple opinions on a certain task, you could get different perspectives. If you wanted to go sky diving, you would take multiple opinions. This is so you can get the full understanding of what you are getting yourself into. One person could say that they have not gone, and that it would be a terrible idea to go. So instead of just taking that one opinion, you go around and ask other people as well. These people say that they have gone sky diving before and that they had one of the best times of their lives. So you take the majority of opinions and go sky diving. This just goes to show that things are not always as they appear, and that you should take multiple opinions on almost everything.

For another example, you want to go and explore a new cave on your on. The problem is, you have no cave exploration experience or knowledge. You go and ask just one person if it would be a good idea. Now exploring a new cave on your own would sound amazing to anyone. This person that you ask however, has cave exploring experience. They say that it is never a good idea to go by yourself, so you take their advice and do not go.

If you were to try the same thing, but instead of asking just one person, you ask multiple people. You could get a different response. However, it is also possible to get the same response. Say instead of going and asking one person, you ask multiple people. All of the people you ask say they have cave exploring experience and knowledge. When in reality, they do not. You ask everyone and then write down all of the information, and a majority says you should go. The thing is, you wanted to do this on your own. So you do not tell anyone where you are going. You get to the cave and look around. You believe that is is safe so you start exploring. When you are only 20 feet in, the roof closes behind you and traps you inside

The thing is, opinions do not always have to be on a mass amount of people. What also comes into effect is how much you trust this person. If you would ask someone you have never met, or if you would ask someone that you have known your whole life. Most people would choose to ask someone they have known, because they have a strong trust and belief that this person will help you make the right desicion.

For example, say you want to try a new sport or occupation, like football. You go to the medical office and ask if it would be a good idea to play football. The doctors say that it would not end up being smart in the long run because, you have a condition that makes your bones extremely fragile. Even the weakest hit on you could end up breaking all of your bones and leaving you paralyzed for the rest of your life.

So instead of listening to the doctors, you go and survey someone to see if you should play. The thing is, you don't mention your condition. Since this person doesn't know you, they do not know about your conditon. Now this person you survey is a football maniac, and they say you should play. You take their advice and play football. On the first play of the game, you get hit and are paralyzed. The doctors say you are paralyzed from the shoulders down, and will never be able to walk again.

Say instead of surveying someone you have never met, you survey someone that you have know for your whole life. You ask them some questions on if you should play football, not mentioning your condition. Since this person knows you very well, they already know about your condition and say you should not play. You could get extremely hurt and maybe even paralyzed. So you take their advice and you don't play. Then in the next week you get an email from your doctor. It reads as if they had found a cure for your condition and if you take medicine, in the next month, you will be back to normal.

For my conclusion, you should take multiple opinions on people you trust. Even if you think there is a chance someone or something is wrong, you are most likely correct. If you even ask just three people instead of one. You can get the full gist of the concept and make the right choice. This one little choice, could end up being something big. So when you ask multiple people for opinions, you are protecting your self from the dangers that are ahead in life.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

I asked my sister for help and she said ""going fast does not help you, you have to be slow and secure to succeed in life"". I thank my sister for giving me advice that is very valuable to me and helped me a lot too, hopefully I pass middle school.

People ask for advice and they ask more than one person because theres other points of view, they can help you decide, and discus the advise that they gave you.

People ask for advice because theres other points of view. She was lost in her own mind with darkness inside of her. She was reaching for help but she did not know that she was trapped in a bad path, I helped her to get up and gave her advice on not going in the wrong way. She was desperate for someone to reach her hand and help her and I told her ""if I wasn't your real friend I will not had helped you but real friends are there for each other"". People sometimes need help on making decisions because they need another person to help them to make the right decision, think about the advice and how can it help you.

Another option that why people ask for advice is that they need help on decide something. Facts show that 50% of the people need help on making decisions to be more sure and confident with the decision that they have made. People sometimes need more help than others to make decisions to be more confident and more secure with what they are doing. Getting help from others it can help you on everything that you are doing and get advice if you are doing something wrong, they can help you with what ever you are going through.

Finally people ask help because they want to discus the opinion or advice. I asked my mom for help because I didn't know that if a girl from school was a good influence on me. My mom said ""if she does something bad will you do it too or will you do it so that she can like you as a friend"". My mom was right and I followed what she had told me because that girl was on a bad path and Im glad that I was not friends with her. Sometimes we need to talk to someone with what is going on and what problems we have and how to solve them. If someone gives you advice do not turn it away first listen to it and try if it helps in your life.

In conclusion some people need help with decision making or getting advice because they want other points of view, help on deciding, and to discus the advice or opinion. If you have a problem or something you are struggling with talking to someone will help you to make a decision or they can give you advice and try it in your life, if it helps remember it don't forget it.

21A42B48B15B,"Seeking multiple choice help me see if it's a good choice or not that I pick what i pick. So say if I went to the store with my mom, dad, and sister and I seen a orange but then I seen a apple. So what I would do is ask my mom which one should I get and then ask my dad finally i would ask my sister and if two of them say i should get the oranges and one of them say apples then i'm going to get the apple. I like asking people what items I should get because it help me make up my mind.

Sometimes If i ask people something it's really hard for me to make up my mind what i should pick. Usually i just close my eyes and spin around and which ever one I'm pointing at is the one i'm getting. But that was when i was a young kid now i just ask my family which one i should get it usually helps me a lot. But you can't just walk up to someone and be like which one should I get i mean some people are okay to say that to but I wouldn't do it because it is dergurous. If i was you Just stick with asking the people that you know like family or friends.

Another example say if i wanted to go hunting with my dad because he loves to hunt but i want to go fish with my grandpa because he loves fishing. So first i would have to go ask my mom and see what she say most likely she going to say my dad so then i ask my sister what should i do and she loves both of them but she would say ""my grandpa because he older man and i always go hunting"". so know to make it far i would probably go on social media and ask my friends and if most of them agree that i should go with my grandpa i take the one vote and add that to my other friends. Then if they say my dad i do the same thing I did with my grandpa add up all the vote from my friends and then add one on to it from my mom. and then i got my answer if i should go with my dad or grandpa.

If you have one choice it not as good as two choices. You maybe don't like that one choice and it would never hurt to ask more then one person. Also some people might give a good reason why you should do what you are doing and if you have go reason for both you just can't go with one you have to go with multiple choice. It's always good to go with more then one answer because you never know how much fun you have if you don't .You never know go big or go home.

When asking for advice it's can be hard at times that why you ask for many answer as you can get. Talking to people can be fun to you never know until you try it. I'm pretty sure it help a lot of people make choice on what they have to do. For example my grandma had cancer she had a choice of living and having to get surgery and have a hard time or we had a choice just letting her past away we didn't want her to have hard times so we made a vote Then we knew it was going to be hard but it was okay so we let her go. seeking multiple choices help in life it help with anything and everything. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

62EA05528EFF,"Many people tend to have some trouble making decisions on some problems like, who to choose over the other person or whether or not to move away and leave everything behind and get a really good job. People do make the wrong choices sometimes, thats why we ask other people for their advice to get a better and honest choice. When we ask one person for their advice we don't really have that much to choose from because we don't know whether it would be the right choice to make. having people around that are willing to give someone advice is a good thing to have because sometimes people can't make choices for themselves. Seeking advice from several people could increase the chances of making the right choice by, giving people multiple choices to choose from, people being honest, they can tell u why they made the choice.

people need to be honest when they are giving out advice because if not then were giving out lies and we shouldn't be. Lying about advice we give to people can put people in bad situations and it's not okay. honesty helps when people give advice we need to make sure it's advice we would give ourselves in that same situation and its a good thing to seek opinions from others when we have trouble making choices as long as we know it's right and they aren't lying about it. Everyone likes to hear the truth no one wants to be lied to when it comes to advice because the problem could be important like, money problems or going to court but can't because the car isn't starting. People have trouble sometimes and need help when they dont know what to do. Be honest about it.

Giving people advice it a good thing to do it gives multiple choices to choose from when needed. people get frustrated when they can't decide on what to eat, what to drink, and what clothes to wear. Some people get upset and break down when things are not working out for them so they call parents, siblings, friends, or anyone they are close to. Multiple peoples opinions come great when someone is in a rough situation because when we don't have any opinions or one opinion we don't have options do chose from.

It's good to be supportive and helpful when it is needed.

people normally want a reason as of to why they think its best to make that choice. It is a good way to prove that what the advice was wasn't just said for no reason. When we give advice we need to give a reasoning on how and why we gave it. Many others think as if no one really cares as much when the give advice it's good to ask several people why its a good thing to make that choice because if not don't add the advice in. this is why it is very important to give people a reasoning.

People dont put it as easy to make our own decisions, it can be hard and it's better to seek advice from more than one person because when u get one persons advice it's not really going to help anyone out. Having several peoples opinions makes it less hard on people to make a choice all they would have to do is say whether or not it's right or wrong. Given a choice is easier way then coming up with something on our own. If one person was to give us their opinion how would we know if they are guiding us to make the right choice.

159424F57C24,"Well for one if you seek more then one person you might likely find someone who will help you. If you only seek one person they might not be of assistance to you. I usually like asking one person like an adult, mostly because they won't ignore you, and they may have the answer your're looking for. I don't like asking students in general, for help cause they will most likely ignore me most of the time, and they may probably not know the answer to your question. Another way I think asking one person for help is ok, is if you ask and adult, ""I always ask an adult first."" If I ask an adult I usually ask just the one, like my teacher for example. ""Because asking an adult usually helps a lot."" Lets say you asked more then one person, and they all had different answers, you could narrow it down to who had the best answer, letting you decide which one made the most sense. And you're learning better that way, ""in my opinion"". Here are some examples of why asking more than one person is ok.

One of them might have the correct answer

They may walk you through it

Narrow it down finding different answers

Both sides have their ups and downs. But if i had to pick one side, it would have be asking more then one person for help. If i'm asking more then one person then I like asking students, because asking more then one adults it would be to weird. It would be almost like asking 20 ensigns for help, don't waste your time asking for that much help, just ask one of them and they will have the answer. Also asking for an adults help makes me sometimes feel uncomfortable, I like asking my friends and see what they think. Some reasons about asking one person for advice

They may be to busy helping someone else

Your not learning better that way

Your also not meeting other people if you just ask one person for guidance. If you don't have a lot of friends ask others and polity say for example ""hey whats the square root of 256,"" some may not know, some might smile and tell you, and after they probably will tell you their name. If you ask nicely then maybe you'll have a new friend. It's always better to ask more then one person for help.

Or just regular conflicts like family arguments, in these situations multiple opinions could possibly help the break the tension in the heated situations listed above. It's sometimes difficult to agree with some opinions but sometimes even the hardest ones to agree with can be helpful

I still felt uneasy about this decision, I wan't sure if that was what I wanted. I talked to my mom and she reminded me that I wouldn't really be happy at that school, it wasn't the best fit for me. I still felt that I was fairly uninformed so I sought more help, I talked to my guidance counselor who reminded me that most wait listed students do get in. She also reminded me that this was my education and I deserved to be at a school I felt comfortable learning in. I decided to say yes to my favorite school. I came to that conclusion only because of all of the people I had talked to and the perspectives I had heard. It was easier to make a decision after talking to multiple people.

Everyone lives a different life, acquires different wisdom, and has a different point of view on every subject. No two, three, or four people are going to think the same on every debatable issue. When it comes time that you need advice, you should talk to two, three, or four people who know you well or have gone through the same thing you are going through. Each one of them will bring something different to the table. You might not agree with all of them, and that is a part of the process. You can listen to everyone's ideas and insights and narrow your options down to what is best for you. You might even find out other options are available. But, no matter what conclusion you come to, the more people you talk to, the more confident you will be in your decision.

We often seek advice from others before making big decisions. To make these decisions it is important that we are informed. Talking to multiple people is also a great way to become more informed about your situation. When you talk to people who may have experienced something similar, you acquire more information and insight to help you make a decision. Imagine that you needed help picking a new house for your family, you might talk to your best friend who would suggest to biggest one, but your mom might suggest the smallest one, less to clean, and another parent might suggest to middle one because your kids need space. Everyone thinks differently, all of these thoughts together can help you make the smartest choice. Notice how when scientists or researchers conduct their studies, they use multiple people rather than just one. That is because they recognize to importance of gaining information from more that just one person. You can feel better about your decision if you know you were informed about it first.

When asking for advice, it is important to talk to multiple people and hear multiple opinions. This will make you more informed about the choice you are going to make. When you are informed, you are likely to make the best choice. Talking to multiple people has helped me to make decisions about my life and particularly my new school. While I have mostly just mentioned big life decisions, it doesn't mean that you have to limit this process to life changing decisions. In everything that you do, talk to multiple people, listen to their ideas, and become more informed. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
74C6A9458BFD,"""Hey Generic_Name, i'm thinking about going to Generic_Name's party tonight even though my parents said I cant, do you think I should go?"" asked Generic_Name with a look of curiosity in his eyes. With no hesitation I responded with,""for sure, It will be fun and plus that cute girl from Generic_School is supposed to be there.""Okay thanks"" said Generic_Name with excitement in his voice. The next day I walk into my first block class and see Generic_Name sitting there with his head on the table."" Hey Generic_Name, how was that party last night?"" I asked.""It was horrible, my parents found out I wasnt home on time so they tracked my phone location, shut the party down, yelled at me in front of everyone, and grounded me for two months."" He stated with a angry and sluggish voice."" It's all your fault if you would of just told me not to go I wouldnt be in this situation right now."" Generic_Name exclaimed. ""I'm sorry, next time just ask more than one person for there opinion.""I said sincerely.""Yeah your right I shouldnt of blamed it on you."" he stated. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it may influence that persons choice, others might look at something in a different perspective then you, and finally others may have more experience in that subject.

One reason why people seek multiple opinions is because it may influence you choice. For example if Generic_Name asked another friend for their opinion his choice might of changed. Lets say his other friend said that his parents might catch him and he may get grounded because he chose to disobey his parents. That may influence Generic_Name's choice because he knows if he gets grounded his parents will take away his electronics and he really dosnt want that to happen. So then he chooses not to go to the party. Studies show that you are most likely to do the right thing rather than the wrong thing eight out of ten times when you ask more then one person for there opinion.

Another reason why people seek multiple opinions is because others might look at something with a different perspective. In simpler terms, because others may look deeper into something then others. For example if you ask someone what type of phone you should get and you say a iPhone because it has the best quality and is most popular. Then you ask another friend and they say you should get a Samsung because it has great durability and you drop your phone a lot so you might want to go with the Samsung because it may save you in the long run so you do not have to pay the extra money to buy new screen all the time.

The final reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that one of the people you may ask could have a history in the subject. In other words, some people may know more about things then others. For example if you are asking your piers about what type of car you should buy and one of them used to sell cars for Honda. They suggest that you should purchase a Honda Acord because of the reasonable price, the great gas millage, the long lasting and high quality fabric that the seats are made of, and the surplus of trunk space. I would most likely trust the guy who used to sell the car versus anyone else.

""Hey Generic_Name, I was wondering if I should go to Generic_Name's party tonight,even though my parents told me no, any thoughts?"" asked Generic_Name."" You should defiantly go, that would be so fun plus I think that cute girl from Generic_School is going to be there, but ask someone else to to see what they think."" I said. ""Hmm, why would I need do that?"" he asked with a confused look upon his face.""Because its always better to hear from more then one person while asking for advice."" I stated. ""Okay, i'll go ask Generic_Name."" he said as he walk of into the mess of people in the hallway all grouped up like ant's when you drop food.""Hey Generic_Name should I go to Generic_Name's party tonight?"" he asked. Generic_Name hesitated then replied with,""well did your parents say you could?""."" No, but I can just say i'm going to hang out at a friends house for a bit."" Generic_Name said softly with a quite tone.""You may get into a lot of trouble if you go, just play it safe and lay low."" Generic_Name said.""True, thanks for your input."" replied Generic_Name. The next day I walk into my first block class and see Generic_Name sitting there with a big smile spread across his face.""Why are you so happy Generic_Name?"" I asked with confusion. ""The party last night got shut down, someones' parent caught them and they all got in trouble."" Generic_Name said.

97FF9200A33D,"Have you ever wondered why somebody might ask you for directions and then walk away and ask somebody else? If you have then don't take offense to it. They only want to make sure they get the right answer. People ask more than one person because someone might not know the answer, one answer might be false, and someone may lie.

First, the person might not know the answer. If a traveler asks you for directions to the interstate and you don't know how to get there, then he or she has to go to another person and ask them. The person that the traveler goes to next for directions after you might not know so the traveler just keeps going. If you don't know the answer tell the traveler that you don't know so they don't get mad at you for giving the wrong information. Therefore, tell the traveler that you don't know the answer.

Secondly, somebody's statement might be false. If somebody's statement is false then you have to ask another person. If somebody says something false and you believe them then you might regret not asking another person. Don't believe anybody unless you have confirmed it with multiple people you trust. Therefore, always see if the person's statement is true or false.

Finally, somebody you ask might lie to you. Even though somebody might really help you and you don't listen to them, still check around. If somebody does lie to you then you can figure it out by asking around. If you do ask multiple people then it doesn't matter if one of them lied. Therefore, make sure nobody is lying to you.

In conclusion, if you or your friend is asking somebody about directions or anything else make sure you ask a couple of people. Remember these things, someone might not know the answer, one answer might be false, and someone may lie. If you need to check and make sure that the statements are true before asking another person the same question. Make sure that you ask advice or directions from people you trust and ask more than one person.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
29BB45AA907C,"Have you ever asked for advice? I ask for advice when I don't understand something or when I need help. When I need advice I ask multiple people so I can get everyones opinion. When I get multiple peoples advice I choose one that will be best for me. What I'm trying to say is that asking for more advice can be useful.

One reason why I think asking for multiple advice is good, and helpful because people could be going through rough times. People ask for advice sometimes because maybe they have family problems, and they need help so they go ask people for advice. When you need advice you don't have to ask one of your family members, you can ask a teacher you trust, your counselor, or your friends. Out of all the advice you get you can choose one advice that you think could help you the most or you can use all the advice people gave you and try them to see if the advice would help. There can be many different reasons why poeple ask for several of advice.

Second reason of why I think asking for multiple advice is good. Another reason why people ask for advice is because they could be making a club, and they might not know what to do. Club members can put up posters, and ask people to write their advice or opinions on what they should do to make the club better, and more interesting. All the advice they will get is going to help them make the club better and they could get more members added to their club. When you ask for advice from people their advice can make things better.

My third reason is, sometimes you are so nervous for a test so you go ask for advice from people. When you want advice for a test you can go to your teacher and ask them for advice, or you can also ask other kids that have took the test before and they can give you some good advice since they took the test already. Advice can really help you if you are nervous. When you are nervous and people are giving you some advice their advice can help you calm down. Sometimes you can also give yourself some adviceb by saying to yourself ""you got this"" or ""you are going to do good on this test"".

I say that asking multiple people for advice is important. It's important because all the advice people give you can help you through out the day. Always ask people that you think can give great advice and always ask people for advice when you need some.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
9986CAEDD2B7,"Many of us have probably found our selves stuck in a situation when you cant decide on something. That can have us reaching out for advice from someone like a family member, friend, or even a stranger. But the person that you ask for help could have a different view point or idea than what had originally thought, wither good or bad. Getting advice from more than one person can prove to be a good thing to help you out when your having trouble seeing form diffrent angles form a decision making stand, asking for advice from multiple is good and can help you in decision making.

When asking more than one person for advice and hearing the different view points from them can prove very beneficial in your choice making.

Because listening to other peoples thoughts on things can help affect and mold your own ideas or choices. It can also help you to become more open minded about a new situation can be good for the mind because being able to see other positive outcomes of a different choice that you can make really helps you out in the long run and in a good way can help you choose a better choice.

When asking others for advice about making a choice, asking multiple people can help you make a better judgment and understand it more. When trying to decide on something we might not really understand what something means or have only seen a small fragment of its potential. By asking others and listening to what they think or know about it can therefore help you to understand more in depth and look at the bigger picture differently because of it.

I can agree that getting advice from more than one person can affect you in a positive way and can help you make better choices Because whenever I need advice trying to decide something like what food to order or what outfit looks better, I always ask my friends for help because I like to hear other peoples thoughts or opinions on something to help make a better decision then I could make on my own. When I was twelve years old my mom had signed me up for a summer camp that I didnt want to attend but talking to other people who had gone before made me change my mind, I was glad I was able to talk to them and changed my mind about it.

Asking for advice from multiple people is good for decision making, for example your family members, friends, or even strangers can help mold your choices or thoughts which can lead you to a making a better choice. They can better improve your knowledge or understanding of something that you didnt before, asking and talking about the different outcomes and other ideas with different people can help open more thoughts and opinions for you, and listening to others view points or beliefs can help you with your final choice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
307DF96FE1EE,"Have you ever had a hard choice to make? Many people like talking to multiple people before finalizing their decision. This gives them the opportunity to listen to other people. Seeking multiple opinions is a good thing because it gives new perspectives to look at, the chance to weigh out different options, and the ability to learn from past decisions.

When seeking multiple opinions, it allows you to have new perspectives to look at. When you have multiple perspectives, you are able to look at the big picture and see what really is the best option. For example, if you are trying to figure out what food you should have at a party, you want to talk to other people to see what they would like, and that could make your decision much easier. Talking to other people may make you feel less stressed because someone may say something that you hadn't thought of, and that could be the perfect answer to solve a certain problem. A new perspective is an advantage when listening to other people's view on the specific situation.

Another thing that you could get out of talking to multiple people is that you get the chance to weigh out your different options. When weighing out each option/opinion, you are able to look at the pros and cons of the different perspectives. While looking at the pros and cons, some people may be able to combine multiple ideas, or potentially it could spark a new idea. If weighing out each option sparks a new idea, it can give you a fresh outlook in the situation you are in. Asking for people's opinion is great because then you are able to find the pros and cons of each opinion.

Another advantage of talking to multiple people is that it gives you the ability to learn. If you are stuck in the same position as you were in the past, people could help you learn from your mistakes. They could help you learn by thinking of a new idea that could prevent the same mistake from happening again. You are able to see where someone is coming from if you disagree on a particular opinion. When talking to people for advice, you are able to learn from other peoples perspectives, even if it interferes with you own.

Overall, when people ask for advice, they like to talk to multiple people,which can come with some advantages. Seeking advice is a good thing because it gives new outlooks on situations, which then gives the opportunity to think of a new idea that could solve the problem. Also, getting advice form different people gives you the chance to look at the pros and cons of each idea to formulate the best option. Listening to other people's opinions can give you the chance to grow, and step out of your comfort zone. These are the some of the many reasons why seeking multiple opinions could overall benefit you.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
5CB2AC659B79,"Have you ever been in a situation where you had no idea what to do, or were stuck between two options? What did you do? Did you randomly pick an option, or did you ask for advice? I'm willing to bet that you chose the latter, especially if it was an important decision. Did you ask a friend? A relative? A stranger? Did you ask a group of people? Was asking a group of people helpful, or would it have been better to ask a single person? If you asked a single person, did you regret not asking a group? Does it really matter if you ask one person or a group of people? Yes, and I will explain why.

What are the benefits of asking multiple people for advice? What positive outcomes can come out of asking a group? To state the obvious, you get more ideas. More ideas mean more possible outcomes for your decision, and the more outcomes, the more chance that it can be a positive one. More people mean more levels of experience, and in different areas. If you want to decide whether you should become a world champion bass fisher or an accountant, you may not find someone who knows a lot about both choices, or even about you. If you ask a group, you could have the opinions of people who have experience in the fields, and people who know you and may know what to do that would most benefit you as a person. Also, have you ever asked for advice, but didn't take it? If so, if you ask a group, you will get more opinions, so you have a higher chance of liking one of them. Additionally, if you ask a single individual, they might not have an opinion or knowledge of what you are asking them. When you ask a group, there is a higher chance that one of them knows what you are talking about, and how to help you.

We have talked about some of the positives of asking a group, but what about the negatives? What could go wrong? One bad thing about asking a group for advice is that it may be hard to choose between different peoples' opinions. If you go to get ice cream with some friends and don't know which flavor to choose, if all of them give you a different opinion to which flavor is the best, you may feel torn between all of the choices that they have presented you with. To add to that, if you choose one friend's advice over the others', your other friends may feel that their opinion does not matter as much to you as the friend who's advice you took. You may also regret the advice that you took, because if pistachio ice cream is disgusting, you may feel that you could have made a better choice by taking the advice of others in the group. You may also be in a situation where the decision that you have to make is very personal, and you don't want to share it with many people. You may feel embarrassed about the advice that you have to ask, and feel that people will judge you for asking.

Why do multiple people's advice help? What if I only want one solution, and I know someone who is qualified to help me and knows a lot about my very important decision? An example as to why more heads are better than one is shown by a test that had twenty people guess the number of marbles in a big jar. Half of the people missed because they either guessed way too high or way too low. The numbers were then averaged, and the resulting number was within about twenty of the actual number of marbles in the jar! This can be applied to asking advice as well. Some people will give horrible advice. That's a fact. But if you look at other people's advice, you are more likely to see that it is bad, and go with the ones that seem great. However, if some people give bad advice, and others give really great advice that you don't want to follow, you can meet in the middle and find a great solution for you. You could also brainstorm ideas and solutions with a group, and just by mentioning a word or phrase, get someone to give great advice that you would never have thought of!

Asking an individual versus asking a group is a decision that you have to will have to make for yourself. Do you want better advice, or do you want to refrain from telling many people something embarrassing? A group can come up with many opinions and great solutions, but an individual can help you keep something confidential. There are many benefits to asking a group for advice, rather than asking a single person, but you may feel that privacy is more important than good and probably more fit advice. In conclusion, the choice is yours. You should do whatever you think is best for your situation, but you should be aware that asking the thoughts of many yields better results for very important decisions, and can help you in the long run.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
2DEBD2B0AB2C,"How does asking for someone else advice helps you feel better? Generic_Name always said ""Asking for someone else opinion makes you come up with a better answer for your questions."" If I have the chance to ask for someone opinion I feel like it will make me feel much better knowing what is someone else prospective about.

One reason that asking for someone else advice benefits you is making the correct choice. Also it helps you understand what is others point of view by asking for their opinion.

Another reason is sometimes asking for someone opinion is much better. When someone ask you to give them an advice about the same topic you can combine your opinion with someone else to give her/she a great helpful advice.

Final reason is there are many ways asking for someone opinion benefits you. For example asking question you don't understand or asking them what you can do to understand. Where can you find information that will help you answer all the questions you got.

15710AAE17FA,"Asking for advise from multiple people is like a phone; it can be helpful or bad for a person. When talking to more than one person for advise can hep someone make better choices, for it prevents consequences, it develops social skills, and it helps a person know who to ask for advise.

To begin with, talking with multiple people for advise can devolve social skills. There are a lot of people in the world that are very shy or just do not talk at all, maybe it is because he or she has social anxiety or just because he or she does not want to be judge by saying something wrong, but sometimes getting out of his or her comfort zone to ask for advise can be well for someone. For example, I am a very shy person that barely talks in school, so asking for advise is really hard for me, but when I did, it helped me make a better choice. Communicating with multiple people can help one make new friendships. Seeking different people for advise can make one grow as a person and help one make better choices.

Also, it prevents consequences. Sometimes at school or at work, there is always that one person that bothers you and gets you angry, but asking for advise can help one not get in trouble. If someone already did something bad, and wants to lie because he or she does not want to get in trouble, it is better to ask for advise, so he or she can do the right thing and not get in more trouble. When someone does the right thing and is a well behave child or is a good employee, he or she will be a role model for other people. For instance, if a child helps another kid do his homework, it will encourage others to do as well and show kindness. In many schools or even at home, kids get bullied and asking for advise to maybe a friend can encourage he or she to make a better choice and to speak up and tell someone.

In addition, if a person asks for advise from multiple people, it helps one know who to ask for advise. In the world there are good people and bad people. The good people always want the best for someone and the bad people do not and might be fake friends. So it is good to ask multiple people for advise because then he or she will know who are the best people to ask for advise to make a better choice. Sometimes even if it is not what he or she wanted to hear from that person but it is very helpful in life. For example, I one day asked for advise to both of my parents and my pastor on something that I wanted to fix in my life and the response they gave me, was not what I wanted to hear, but it helped me do better in life.

In conclusion, seeking more than one person for advise can help him or her make better choices. It can help a person talk more and develop his or her social skills. It can also help prevent consequences to make someone do the right thing instead of the wrong thing. It can help some know who are the good people and who are not, so when asking for advise, he or she can ask the best people. Asking for advise can be hard sometimes but it will help him or her make better choices in life. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

While making a decision you may have some second thoughts, asking more people could help you decipher which works for you to complete your task.

Even having a discussion with a group could help open up some new ideas.

Having different people have different takes on your opinion. Sharing these ideas helps us communicate better and understand things more than we thought.

487739AC4B1E,"In 2002, a study showed that only 23% of Americans asked more than one person when seeking advice. However, asking more than one person for advice may get you different answers because people have gone through different experiences. They most likely had different outcomes, some good and others bad. Asking multiple people for their opinions can improve your knowledge because people have gone through different experiences, the elderly has lived through history, and even if people aren't there your peers post blogs and websites online.

To begin with, everyone lives their own life and makes their own decisions; therefore, they go through different journeys and down different paths. When I was little, my mother told me a story her parents told her when she was my age. It started out with my grandma, Generic_Name, being about twelve years old and not knowing what to do. She needed advice. My grandmother decided her best option was to ask multiple people and see what they had to say. Initially, she decided she would talk to her mom, my great grandmother, and she told her a story about what she did and how it went well when she went through the same experience. Next she decided she would talk to her dad, he told her the same story that her mom told her but from his point of view since he never had to deal with it. Her next choice was to talk to her best friend, Generic_Name, but she had an awful time with this when it happened to her, yet Generic_Name still gave her advice. Generic_Name was thankful she had asked three people because she received three different outcomes.

Additionally, an author once said, ""Treat your elders with respect as they are older and wiser."" The elderly has gone through going to school but while that happened and they were growing up they also lived through wars, poverty, some may have kids or even grandkids, and over the past about twenty or so years new ages/generations, and the upbringing of technology. The author mentioned ""wiser"", they have lived through so much and they were always learning something new. Therefore, they know a lot and can be another option for giving advice.

Lastly, whether the decision you have to make is life changing or a small choice there is always someone or something that can help. About two years ago my best friend, Generic_Name, called me and told me to come over as soon as I could. Not knowing what any of this was about, I rushed over there and she said she needed to talk. I listened while she told me this sad story about Generic_Name, her sixteen year old cousin, who was now pregnant. She continued to talk and asked me what I thought. I was speechless knowing that her cousin was thinking about getting an abortion. Generic_Name said that Generic_Name's parents and grandparents passed away in a car accident two months ago and Generic_Name was angry at the world so she went to a college party, had too much to drink, and met a guy. A month later, she found out she was pregnant and did not have anyone to talk to. She spent the next month looking up ""How to take care of a baby"", ""Abortion"", ""Teen Pregnancy"", and a lot of other things before she had talked to Generic_Name and asked for advice. Generic_Name had gotten some advice from blogs and websites online but she also wanted to talk to Generic_Name before she made a decision, but Generic_Name didn't know what to do, so she called me. The next week, we went to lunch with Generic_Name and had a long discussion. We didn't force her into or out of anything; although, we did give her our opinions. As we were leaving, Generic_Name mentioned that she was thankful that she looked up blogs and websites online and that she was able to talk to us. No matter how big or small the choice, someone is always there.

In conclusion, when you ask more than one person for advice it can better your understanding because people have had different outcomes with similar experiences, your elders are wiser and can be another option for giving advice, and if you do not have people to support you and give you advice, people in your community and around the world post websites and blogs online. Your peers, community, family, and friends are all there to support you and help give advice. No matter how big or small the decision is, someone is always there to help.

For example, figuring out what to wear, what to eat, or maybe even where to go. When we struggle to choose on our own, can getting advice or opinions from others help?

Choices are made everyday. Good choices, bad choices, little choices, big choices. You almost always have a choice to make about what's going on. What happens if you can't make a decision by yourself? This is when you begin to ask your friends or family. Everybody has an opinion, so you will always have somebody to help you out. In fact people usually give you their opinion, even if you don't ask. For example, you tell someone that you prefer dogs over cats, they will most likely tell you which animal they prefer of the two. You can always rely on somebody to give you an opinion or advice.

Most people tend to ask their friends about smaller decisions, and their family about bigger decisions. The advice your family gives, is much different from your friends. Your friends are good for giving advice about clothes, or social media. Your parents can give good advice about school problems, or friendship issues. This is most likely beacause your parents have been there before, and they know what it's like. Either way asking a friend or family member can change your mind to help you make a decision.

It is always a good idea to get assistance making a decision if you are struggling to make one alone. Everyone around you may see each situation differently. This is good because when you ask for advice from multiple people, they may help you to look at something in a different way. There is no harm in asking for advice beacause if you do not agree, you can simply ignore it and listen to your mind. You make many decisions on your own, but never be afraid to ask for advice. The benefits of simply asking are endless.

In conclusion, asking for multiple opinions is a good idea because you may be able to see the situation from a different point of view. This may even give you more options. Advice from friends and family can often push you toward the right decision. In moments of confusion or misunderstanding, remember you always have somebody to talk to, and get advice from.

For example, if someone has a problem with a co-worker at work, asking multiple people for advice would benefit that person by giving him or her multiple options on how to deal with the problem with the co-worker, or if someone just broke up with his or her lover, seeking multiple advice on how to deal with the break up would give him or her multiple options on how to deal with that break up.

Further more, receiving multiple peoples advice can also benefit someone by allowing them to remember the advice they were told in the past, and use it in the future. If a person has a similar problem to the one they had in the past, the advice they were told in the past would benefit that person by allowing him or her to overcome the problem like they did in the past.

Finally asking multiple people for advice allows a person to pass all the advice they were told down to the next generation of his or her family. Passing all the advice someone learned down to his or her children would help that persons children allot. Examples of that happening is if someones child went camping in the future and he or she gets lost, the advice his or her parents told him or her on what to do if they get lost camping would help them get out of that situation easily.

As you can see, there are many more reasons why seeking more than one persons advice can be so beneficial, but some people might not agree with seeking multiple peoples advice because it might confuse them, or just have them put more stress on themselves with having to pick whose advice works best, but more opinions is the best way to go.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
152A4E283823,"Why do people talk to more than one person when they need advice? It is because the advice won't be biased, it gives a variety of advice, and at least one of those people will have good advice. If advice is needed, multiple people must be contacted for those reasons. It will benefit the person seeking advice heavily. There is no reason not to ask for advice from multiple people.

First off, advice won't be biased if multiple people are consulted. No one likes a biased opinion. If an opinion is only seen from one side, then advice will not be as helpful. This is why multiple people need to be contacted. Biased opinions aren't accepted anywhere else, so why should they be accepted when seeking advice.

Also, seeking opinions from multiple people will get a variety of advice to pick from. Varieties are always nice when it comes to advice. If theres no variety, then the limited choices given might not be any good. Bad advice is not going to take people anywhere. Always get a variety of opinions when advice is needed.

Lastly, the advice has to be helpful. That is why multiple people need to be spoken to, if any helpful advice is going to be obtained. If only one person is consulted, then they might not have very helpful advice. If multiple people are consulted, then one of them will have the right advice for the situation. Everyone needs good advice and seeking multiple opinions is the best way to get it.

That is why multiple opinions are needed for advice. The advice won't be biased, it gives a variety of advice, and it gets the best possible advice. It makes no sense not to consult multiple people for advice. It makes the situation a lot easier. Don't be stupid and seek advice from multiple people.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
DE2A70D1284E,"Imagine yourself in a stressful situation causing you to be confused and frustrated because you cannot form a legitimate solution. In this situation your problem may be dire, but the usage of advice from others can help you. Through everyday life, we are constantly finding ourselves in troubling circumstances. Gaining advice from multiple sources is a powerful way to combat our problems. Often, it is advice and guidance from others that provides us with the strength and expertise needed to resolve conflict. Support from friends or family and assertive words can be just what we need when dealing with a problem. Asking multiple sources for advice can influence you to make better decisions because you learn different perspectives, gain knowledge from others who have dealt with similar circumstances, and realize the multiple ways to solve the problem.

It is helpful to seek advice from many sources because you can realize the many different perspectives of your situation. When seeking advice from others, we likely already have a favored position on the topic. Sometimes, we search for reassurance and not advice. However, questioning others about our situations is better for the outcome of the experience because it brings us new perspectives. Perspective can be key to finding the solution to a problem because it allows one to look at the problem as a whole, and not just from a biased position. When blinded by a biased perspective, we force ourselves to ignore different outlooks on the situation. It is when we remove that toxic blindfold that we realize whether we are truly in the wrong or what is the true source of the conflict. Having different perspectives will only provide you with a more sincere and graceful approach to dealing with a problem.

Questioning others about ways to resolve your problems is helpful because it provides you with input from people have dealt with similar circumstances. Specifically, it is more beneficial when you ask others who have dealt with similar experiences for help. When we do this, we find ourselves relating to others and taking their advice into greater consideration. Through this method, we gain knowledge on possible outcomes for our conflict and how it can be resolved. While filtering our own bias with this new information, we can formulate possible solutions for ourselves. This is an intriguing way that we can all solve our problems because we can use the experiences of others to better our own. Using the lessons learned by others to prevent yourself from carrying the same misfortunes is a key way to avoid conflict. This strategy allows yourself to feel more comfortable about handling the problem because you know someone who has dealt with the same thing. No matter how complex a problem can be, empathy from another who can relate will make the situation better.

Asking other sources for their opinion also gives you the ability to interpret the situation in many different ways. It is inevitable that the more people you ask, the more likely you are to hear different opinions and opposing responses. This is a natural occurrence considering that as humans, we all have unique experiences that effect how we look at situations. Through asking others for possible solutions, we can find one that correlates best with how we feel. Sometimes it takes getting a large collection of advice from different sources to piece together a comfortable solution. We can carve away bits and pieces from that block of advice to sculpt our resolution. When seeking advice, we can act as detectives to collect the different fragments of advice and piece it together to form a conclusion.

As a result of us collectively having different experiences in life, we get to provide one another with new thoughts and ideas through giving advice. The process of seeking multiple opinions can provide you with a guaranteed and better outcome for handling a pressing conflict. You can also recognize the many ways one can look at the situation. As well as, recognize the results from of others when they went through the same occurrence, and the multiple ways you can resolve the situation. Having a myopic mind can be a true curse, and taking advice from others prohibits yourself from making consequential mistakes because of being blinded by bias. Talking to others who have dealt with the similar problem allows you to feel more comfortable in your situation, and gain some peace in being to relate to another. Having others provide with different ways they would resolve the situation allows you to consider the many options and pick the best one for your situation. Friends, family, associates and the others in your life all have access to the information you need to make the best decision for yourself. When dealing with conflict, it would be most beneficial to use their knowledge to prevent your problems from troubling you intensely.       ",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
BE126D453657,"Making decisions can be hard sometimes but it can become quite easier when you go to others for help. I've came up with a couple of reasons and examples to why it is better to ask more than one person for help when you con to a bump int he road.

Everyone has thought of different strategies to do an activity so why not go see things from others perspective. Here's an example of what this might look like. Lets say it almost 1 in the morning and your out with your friends and you were supposed to be home by 12am. You guys were just jamming to music while driving to go get some food. Your phone starts ringing and you realize that it was your mom. You panic so u just let it ring. She called a couple more times after so you turn to your friends and ask them what you should say. Everyone said to not worry about it and just relax besides one person. He told you that you need to answer here and at least tell her that you are safe and where your going. He has been in the same situation before and chose to do the the wrong choice and regretted it later when the cops were searching for him.

Asking more than 1 person can also give you more verities to chose from and give you thought that you never would have. Imagine that you are planning a surprise party for one of you family members that are moving from a different country. You don't know what they are interested in so you go to family members that have met them before and ask questions like, What's their favorite type of food? What activities do they think are fun? Etc. By the time the move you will have plenty of options for the food, party theme, games, and music!

At the end of the day, asking for help from multiple people isn't a problem because you never know what kind advice you might get in return. Just know that it all comes down to you to decide who you would rather listen to. And who can trust.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
3BE93D14041D,"There are many reasons I can think of why people need more than one persons advice and some are life changing. In the next few paragraphs I will explain the reasons I can think of why you need multiple peoples advice. Although I feel I need to clarify why we need advice in general. Advice is mainly helpful for learning, also it can help those who don't see what they should do, but if you got bad advice it might effect your whole life. Now that I've clarified that, time to continue with the question.

First reason, multiple viewpoints on the topic or compare and contrast. Now this reason would probably apply to someone who is seeking advice before a decision. An example of this reason : Generic_Name needs a new bike,so he goes in the bike shop and ask his friends for advice on which bike he should get and they do now. Generic_Name goes to the counter and the cashier gives him some advice so now he can compare and contrast the bikes in his head and decide which one to get. In the example Generic_Name has three point of views on the different bikes so he could easily make a choice. This is like research but from people who have done the research. Also Advice comes from friends and family mostly so you Know it isn't bad advice.

Second reason, bad advice. when you get bad advice you what to get more advice from some one else or maybe you don't even know if it is bad advice that is why always get more than one person to get advice from. Now for an example: You just turned twenty and you're still living with your parents so you go to your bad friend house because you think he has cool job probably. So you get to his house then ask him and he says you could join my gang we do cool things and get a lot a money you think about talking to your other friend but then you say yes anyway. The next day you go to jail for murder because your friend comited murder to rob a bank. You were sitting in a car waiting for your friend to get out of the bank you didn't think that he hurt or robed anyone. Now you in prison for forty years and your friend for life. When you were about to get your good friends advice you didn't but if you did you would realize how bad of an idea that is and would of been fine, so never be to careful.

Now I could list a few more but these are the main ones and most important. The first reason is useful and the second is for your safety. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

Seeking for multiple opinions is more helpful than seeking for just one opinion. Asking one person for their opinion wouldn't help you make a better choice. One opinion is not as much as multiple opinions. Multiple opinions have a bigger impact on your decision. The more opinions you get, changes the way you think about your decision and it helps you make the best one for you. Asking just one person for their opinion doesn't help you make a better choice but, asking multiple people does. You can be brought down by one opinion if it's negative but, if you ask for multiple opinions you can get some positive and some negative and both of them will help you decide what the right choice is. Seeking multiple opinions is better than seeking just one opinions because one persons opinion doesn't matter as much as multiple peoples opinion, multiple opinions have a bigger impact on your decision, asking for one opinion isn't as effective as asking for multiple opinions to make a better choice.

More knowledge is important because it helps you make a wiser decision, changes the way you think, and helps approach a thought in a different way.

Seeking many opinions help you see others point of view. It makes you question yourself. You keep asking yourself is this the right choice for me, which is a good thing because it helps you decide what's best for you. It helps you see how people think about your decision. You are able to see whether their opinion is something negative or positive. Others opinions make you either quit your goal or keep pushing towards it. Positive opinions will make you feel like your doing the right thing but, negative opinions will make you think your doing the wrong thing. Seeking multiple opinions is a good thing because it makes you question yourself, see the way other people think, see if your doing the right thing, and all of these make you chose the best choice for yourself.

C862AF5812E2,"When people ask for advice they ask for it because their in a bad situation. And they relly need it the most. They mainly ask people they trust and know. Because they know the most about them. And they know the best ways to help them. They mostly go to family members and close friends. Sometimes if they are in school they go to a trusted adult. Like the guidance consular, a teacher, principal, and the police officer if they have one at the school.

The reason people ask for advice because they dont know how to do things right. And they are they are probably not feeling well. it could be something going on at home they need help with. things like their mom and dad are probably going through something, somebody in their family passed away, or their just going through rough times. And they dont know how to deal with it they just need some help and advice on how to deal with the situation. And it not bad to ask for help and advice.

It is a good thing to ask multiple people. Because their is different kind of situations. You never know what the situation is or how bad it is. Asking multiple people you can figure out which one is the best and see if that fixes the problem. So if that doesnt then you got the other peoples ideas to help the problem out.

37E07916B614,"Whether it's a crime or a dangerous activity, one bad decision can completely ruin your life. This is why many people, including myself often seek advice from others before making important decisions. Asking for advice from multiple people is very beneficial as you see the many views on the decision at hand, you feel reassured when making the decision, and you avoid repeating the same mistake.

Asking multiple people for advice is extremely important as it provides different perspectives on the choices available to you. As long as you ask the right people, different perspectives change peoples opinion and lead them to making the right choice. An example of when seeing multiple perspectives helped me was when I was skeptical about joining the Model UN team at my school. I thought it would be a waste of time, but when I asked my parents, they told me otherwise. They listed reasons for why they thought it would be best if I joined it and because of this, I joined the team. If I hadn't asked for advice, then I wouldn't have seen their perspectives and therefor wouldn't have decided to join the team.

Often, people get stuck and are unable to make a decision. They then abandon the opportunities that were there because they didn't get help. However, seeking advice from trustworthy people reassures that they are making the right choice and prevents them from trying to run away from the decision. This then leads to people feeling confident in themselves after they have decided what to do, and promotes them trying harder because they believe they're doing the right thing.

Most people can't remember a single thought they had the day before, but many still remember the wise advice they were given years upon years ago. This demonstrates the importance of asking multiple people for advice as you will often remember it, preventing you from repeating the same mistake. I have heard many stories where people continue to commit the same crimes over and over again until they finally seek advice from trustworthy individuals and stop. This emphasizes the need to get advice even when you have already made a mistake.

In conclusion, asking others for advice is often vital to making the right choices. It provides you with different perspectives, reassures that you are making the right choice, and prevents you from repeating the same mistake. While it isn't necessary to seek advice for every choice, it is important to find trustworthy people to help you make decisions that severely impact your life.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
8CCB7E601107,"When you are in need for help, what do you do? Do you seek for an answer or do you do it yourself? I say looking for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. It helps because you get to see someone elses point of view, someone may see something that you don't, and they may have already delt with something similar and they know what to do.

First, it is important to see others point of view. I say this because they might have many more ways that you never thought of to figure out what you are going through. Also, seing their way of view may help you relize things you didn't relize before. This may give you ideas or different ways to approch the situation. Their way of seeing things may alter a bad decision you are about to make. This is why you should try to see their point of view.

Secondly, they may see something that you can't or couldn't see. You may not have seen what was wrong but that other person did. You may have said something that you thought nothing of but someone tells you what was wrong because they noticed it but not you. Sometimes in life, it takes another person to help you see your mistakes or something you should've never done. You may think to yourself that you are doing something right but someone knows that it is wrong so they tell you that what you are doing is not a good choice.

Lastly, people go through harder or similar things. When you are going through something and you need help, there is someone out there who knows the troubles. People go through things everyday and they may give you advice that they used that helped. Their ways may be the advice you need to get through whatever situation there is. People may have gone through something way different but their advice will still help you or it may even make you think of another way that will work for you.

42661B3C5F70,"Why should someone seek out the opinions of other people to make a decision? Well, seeking the opinions of others while trying to make a decision is helpful in many ways. Speaking to a trusted friend will help one make a decision because he or she would want what is best for his or her friend. Also, different points of view are crucial in decision-making because the only way to make a well-informed decision is to be well-informed on all the possible choices you can make.

Primarily, good friends should want what's best for other people, so their opinions will be what they think is the best choice to solve a problem. This also applies to the advice of professionals such as doctors. Doctors are there to help people get healthy, so they will want whatever is best for their patient. A time when I used the advice of others was when I had to decide between going on a school trip to New York City or participating in my school's band concert. I sought out the advice of many of my friends. I trusted those people, so I knew that they would tell me what they thought was the right decision for me to make.

Another benefit of listening to other opinions is that hearing different points of view can make one realize all the aspects of the decision. Usually, humans are hard-wired to think that there is always a right and wrong way of going about things. Opening up to different viewpoints is an excellent way to help yourself make a decision because other people will share why they think their answer is right. This makes a person more knowledgeable about his or her problem, allowing him or her to make a more informed decision. This strategy has helped me make a decision in the past. When I was trying to decide between going to New York City or staying to help my band play well at our concert, many of my friends had contrasting opinions. My friends from band class compelled me to stay because this was our most important concert of the year, and the band always played better when everyone was there. On the other hand, my friends who were going on the trip pointed out that this was a very special opportunity that I had to take advantage of. I used their advice to help me make a good decision.

The advice of others eventually helped me make a decision, as it has helped many others. If someone asks for the opinion of someone he or she trusts, that person is sure to give advice that he or she thinks is best for their friend. Hearing different viewpoints than your own is also helpful in making an informed decision. While making a decision, it's important to keep the advice of others in mind. However, at the end of the day it is the duty of the individual to make his or her own decision.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
4CC422B5E710,"If you can't decide between two or more things, you can always get other peoples opinions. But why? Why as humans do we care about other peoples opinions? How can that help us? Well, I got some answers for you! There are a couple of different reasons why you might ask for someones opinion. These reasons might be to see their point of view or to get more opinions.

Every person has an unique personality. With an unique personality comes a new perspective. A different perspective can be good because they could have ideas that you never even thought of. You can even work together with the other person, so that you both have new and original ideas.

Another reason why someone might want to ask people for advice is to get more opinions. Lets say that your having a birthday party. You love chocolate cake, so you bought one. No one invited to the party likes chocolate cake, so they don't come. Now you have a party that no one came to and a lot of chocolate cake. I think in a situation like this, you should let the majority pick the cake. If the majority picks vanilla, but you still want chocolate, you can get both.

In conclusion, ask for other peoples opinions. It will help you in the long run. Who knows? You may even discover your love for vanilla cake! You don't have to listen to this, but it will help to see that the reason why people ask for advice is to see other peoples point of view and to get more opinions.

Your Principal warns you that it's too far away, and that the buses won't make it back to school before the end of the day. You don't take his advice. Halfway back from the trip, it's dark outside and the bus runs out of gas. You also forgot about feeding the students for dinner. You wished you had planned better and took your Principal's advice.

In our everyday lives, seeking the opinions of others can help you make a more well-rounded decision that benefits more than one person, but may take away some of you original intentions. Decisions that include more than one person sometimes require a leader to think this way. If people were to go about thinking only of their own opinions, then we would have a selfish world. By looking for others' opinions, we are humbling ourselves and looking at the greater good. Searching for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

As you may know, everyone in this world thinks a little differently on any given subject. No one person can make a perfect decision for the rest of his/her peers. In 2019, a study by Willits University was taken across the country that asked many average Americans what kind of pizza they would exclusively eat for the rest of their lives. According to the data, 20% of Americans said they would eat pepperoni, 10% would eat Meat Lover's, 15% would eat vegetable pizza, 30% would eat cheese, and 25% said they would eat Hawaiian. If one person were to decide the type of pizza everyone else were to eat for the rest of their lives, then at least 70% of people would not get their preferred pizza. It's just not possible to make a decision that benefits everyone using only their own resources. Preferences of others are unclear to just one person. When we look for others' opinions, we find a way to possibly make a lot more people get the outcome they want.

Additionally, looking at the past and present of our government and most businesses, leaders have many advisers to help them make the best outcome decision. Most leaders that hold high positions are powerful, and can make decisions that take thousands, if not millions of dollars. Leaders, like the President, need to make smart decisions that don't lead to negative consequences. Because of this, the President has cabinet members, which act like advisers for him. They help him decide which government organizations and projects to fund, and which not to fund. Generic_Name, one of the President's cabinet members says, ""The President has to look at the big picture; he needs to work and find the needs and opinions of the people to solve problems."" Leaders have to find an overall decision that benefits many people at once. Government funded public services are built around providing service that benefits many people. In fact, our entire government's structure is designed to shoot down any single-opinion behavior from any one of the three branches of our government by the checks and balances system. If the President's budget plan isn't supportive of a 'need' that congress thinks it is missing, they don't approve it. When leaders seek multiple opinions, they make a choice that supports large amounts of people, not just themself.

Similarly, the strategy of seeking multiple opinions relates to experimentation in science. When taking an experiment, multiple trials are done to eliminate errors and find an average in the data. The individual opinions of others are all slightly different, just like the individual values in data collecting. In decision making there is an outcome decision that is the average of everyone's individual opinions, and in data collection, the result is the average of all the values recorded in the experiment. Generic_Name, a professor in the field of psychology once said in an article, ""Because the two [decision making and data collection] are so similar, each individual opinion is like a data point, so any opinion that is off from the others could be considered as an 'error'. When we try to make an average outcome decision, we are essentially eliminating errors, just like in data collection."" In psychology, survey and test data is something that psychologists deal with all the time. By eliminating 'errors' and averaging everyone's opinions together, we get a more accurate outcome.

To sum everything up, a better decision is made by seeking multiple opinions from others. By doing this, we are looking at the big picture and are more likely to come up with an overall outcome that benefits everyone . Nobody has the exact same opinion, so nobody can make decisions for everyone else. Leaders of businesses and even the government, like the President, have advisers. The strategy of making an overall opinion even relates to accurate data collection in science. No matter what, the decision almost always has to be a compromise. If we were to go about in our lives only planning by ourselves and thinking selfishly--you may as well be stuck in that bus with no fuel on the side of the highway in the middle of the night.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
C97DFE0AC3C4,"In everyday life, you have to make choices. These choices vary from a small problem, to a situation where you can't handle it by yourself. Most time it isn't easy, so you go to get advice from our friends, family, co workers, or teachers. Seeking multiple opinions from more than one person makes you choose better choices because you a get a variety of options and opinions, you get advice on how to make your own choices, and people that are wiser then you tend to giver better advice from their own personal experiences.

When you get a variety of opinions from many people you have a higher chance of making better choices. This is because when you get different inputs, you can choose the advice that fits appropriately with your specific situation. For example, if you are in a hard situation at work, and you need to make a finical situation, your co workers, parents, grandparents, and younger siblings will have completely different answers. Your parents, co workers, grandparents have had to work a job either in the past or in the present, meaning from experience they will have a variety of opinions. They would have different job expireneces, so everyone answers will be different and unique from one another. With the variety of options you are given, you can choose the choice that suits your situation the best. With their input, your choice option is better than when they did not contribute to your problem.

In some circumstances when you receive advice from someone, you come up with your own solution while discussing with them. In this case, you make a better choice because you came up with your own solution and you know how to handle the situation correctly. An example could be when you are in a tough situations with friends, for instance you get in a fight or your can not compromise with a solution, you would most likely talk with your parents or another friend. While discussing with them you are participating with them as well while trying to think of an appropriate solution to your problem. They constantly give you ideas that just don't fit in with your situation. After a long time of thinking over your problem with your friend, you can get frustrated easly because all you want is the fight to be over. Once your state of mind is like that, it just spits out ideas of its own, and that is when you come up with your own solution. Thanks to your family and friends multiple opinions and options trying to help you out as much as they could, you come up with your own solution to your problem.

The final reason why seeking multiple opinions can help you make better choices is because some people, most likely older folks, are wiser and have more experience in difficult life situations. Your situations could vary from not doing well academically, to a heart break, or to financial difficulties. All these things have happened to your parents or grandparents. Your wiser adults would gladly give you advice from their personal experiences, and they will give your a wide variety of choices. They have more experience than the younger generation meaning there options are most likely the best options to choose. Having a wiser adult guide you through life to help you make better choices is a big advantage in the future for your self. You would thank them for helping you be a better person by choosing the best choices.

In conclusion, when you are in a tough situation, multiple opinions can help you make the best choice possible. Taking the advice that people give you and seeing if it can be applied to your problem helps with any situation. When you listen to people that want to help you out, the outcome can be that you get a variety of options and opinions, you get advice on how to make your own choices, and people that are wiser that you could help you out from their personal experiences. The next time you can possible get out of a problem, seek multiple options, it will help you in the long run.  ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
20EE7E422C2D,"Do you seek multiple opinions when making a hard choice or decision? I feel it is important to discuss your options with several people before you stick to a decision. There are many times when I have made the wrong decision because I only talked to one person about my choice. Including when I joined the softball team after talking to only my mom. She thought that I would have a great time and learn a lot, but soon after practices started I learned that this was not the sport for me. Now, whenever I have a decision to make, big or small, I always take advice from more than one person.

When I ask for advice I enjoy talking to multiple people to get their perspective on my options. One example of this is when you are applying to colleges. One individual may tell you that a certain college was wonderful and that they had a great educational experience there, while another person may tell you that they hated that specific college and didn't learn anything while at it. Other examples include trying out for a new sport, taking music lessons, or how to study for an upcoming test. I think it is important to get and give useful advice.

When making a choice you don't always consider all of your options or alternatives, asking someone for their advice will help you when its time to make the decision. It will give you insight on how your choice will affect you and others around you. While it may be easy to get advice you also need to know how to give the best advice to someone in need of it. Your friends, family, teachers, and peers will give you advice, and get advice from you all throughout your life.

All people give you different advice due to their experience, opinions, education, and ability. I learned that when trying to make the best choice it is important to seek multiple opinions from a number of people. If you don't get advice from more than one person it may result in not picking the best choice or decision. When making a choice be sure to analyze all the advice given to you and take every aspect into consideration. Always seeking multiple opinions will help you make the best choices and decisions.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
C0542F9D82BC,"Why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Sometime going to other people for advice can help you with many different situations. Some people may have a very good explanation to whats going on,they just maybe more experienced then you, or can be seen for another point of view.

First sometime going to other people for advice can help you with many different situations. Your having a problem in yous relationship,and you want to work it out but you dont know whats going on. Maybe your not spending enough time with your husband or wife. So you go to a friend you can trust,and yall talk about what to do,then you go back home and work it out.

Second Some people may have a very good explanation to whats going on,or maybe they have more experience then you. Your've building a car with your dad and you try to start it but it wont turn on. You and your dad are lost on what to do. So you go to a mechanic,and turns out u was missing some key parts to the motor.

Third the person you go to see may look at the problem from a different point of view. Your arguing with a sibling about something and both of you think you right. Your sibling goes to your parents about the situation. Both of you tell your side of the argument. Your sibling is right,but you wasnt completely wrong either.

Finally in my opinion going to other people for advice is a great choice if your torn about what to do. Different people mean different results. The more people more results. This will conclude my essay thank you.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

During the summer of 2018, I was torn between two decisions. I had the choice to go to a famous baseball tournament in Cooperstown, New York, or go to Europe with my family. I was thinking about this tournament since the day I started playing baseball, but going to Europe is also very fun and I get to spend time with my family. when I was trying to decide between the two destinations, I consulted some of my friends and adults that I know. My parents wanted me to come with them to europe, and my coaches wanted me to go with them to Cooperstown. My teameates wanted me to go to Cooperstown, but my siblings wanted me to go to Europe. they all gave me some advice on where I should go, and my coach said, go where you would feel the most comfortable, and where you will have the most fun. Hearing all of these opinions and getting advice from everyone allowed me to make the best decision, I ended up going to Europe with my family.

As you get more information, you might run across a new option that you didn't know was available.

Getting advice from several opinions can often open up new options

Before my 11th birthday, my dad gave me the choice to get a new Xbox, or a new beseball bat. He gave me the day to devide which one he should get for me. When I went outside to play with my friends, I decided to ask for their advice. Some of my friends that play Xbox told me to get a new Xbox so that I could play with them. My baseball teammates told me to get a new bat so I could share it with them. One of my friends that I asked, played neither Xbox, or on my baseball team. He told me to take the cash value of the more expensive item, and spend it how I want. I was so thankful I had asked for his advice, because I never would have thought of this in a million years. Along with opening new options, seeking advice from more people might open you up to new perspectives.

Asking for advice from different people can help give more perspectives on the situation. During the summer of 2017, I had a big growth spurt, leaving me with a bunch of clothes and gear that does not fit me anymore. I was going to sell my stuff for profit, so I started to plan a garage sale and sorting out how much I would sell everything for. When I was asking for advice on how I should sell my stuff, most of my friends told me to sell the so that I could make as much money as possible. when I asked my teacher for advice on how I should sell them, she told me that I should not sell them at all. she told me that I should donate it to a charity that she works for in her free time. she told me about the organization and how it gives back to kids that are less fortunate and can't afford clothes like us.

This helped me get a new perspective on the situation that I didn't know existed.

Asking for advice from different people will be more beneficial than asking for advice from just one person.

If you're asking for advice, ask for several opinions, it is more beneficial and will get you the best answer.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
C490AAD18CB2,"What would you do if you needed advise ? Would you take it from more than one person ? Seeking for more that one persons for advise is the best choice because you are able to know more about your situation from many people and another is that it will help you find the right choice . These two options can suggest you from finding the right and best choice with what ever is happining in your life .

A example why you should take advise from more than one person is knowing more information. Asking multiple people about your situation and then having experience with what your going though will help the best . If you ask mulitiple people that have been though that too,It helps you see through different peoples points of view. Which allows you to know what your options are .For example you get into a big fight with your parents , So you ask your two best friends who have both been in that position what you should do .One friend talks to about how you should apologize to your parents .The other friend tells you , you should talk to them both and fix the problem . They both agreed you should apologize and fix the problem .

Another choice you have for asking multipe people for advise is making the right choice. If someone gave you there opinion about your situation but it was a bad idea. And you took their advise but lead to a even bigger problem. This is the reason why we should have more options open because if we get only one person's advise/opinion it can either be fixing the problem or making it worse . Keeping our options open is a amazing choice. For a example you get into a argument with some of your friends about them talking about you behide your back . You ask someone what they think about your situation , So they give you someof their advise . They said that you should go confront them and that's what you did , you get into a physical fight with your friends. If only you had asked more people to give you advise , you wouldn't have been in a fight and even cause more problems.

In conclusion why we should have alot of people comment on our situation or problem is because it can lead to us living a better life . It can make us become more open to people we trust and become closer. Asking more people can also leave to a better life style . We should all ask multiple people for the advise so we can all make the best choice .",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
5D48FA3291DE,"It is better to ask more people for advice than to just ask one person, because someone can hear more points of view, it leads to more discussion, and the person with a problem can think about a decision or problem more. When asking for advice, it is usually to solve a problem. If someone only gets one perspective on a problem and then makes a decision, it is a quick decision to what could be a more important problem. When multiple people are asked for advice, they will have different ways on how they see a particular problem. This is good because it helps look at a situation in more than one way, and make a decision that makes the most sense. When multiple people are asked, there is more of a discussion about a problem, which can help think of more ideas.

One of the reasons asking more people for advice is the best way to go, is that someone can hear all of the different ways people look at a situation. This is good for the person who is asking advice, because the person can look at the problem in all different ways, and see which solution best fits their personal needs and goals. This is better because what makes sense to one person, might not make sense to another person. As they say, nobody knows someone better than them self, which applies to someones problems. Hearing different points of views will also allow someone to see which point of view is the most popular opinion, and they can make their decision based off of what most people agree on.

Another reason why asking multiple people for advice is better than asking only one person, is that it leads to more discussion. When there is a situation that needs a solution, the best way to find a solution is through discussion. When only one person is asked for advice, there will only be one discussion, and there will be only one point of view. When multiple people are asked, the person asking for advice will have a lot more discussion about the problem they're facing. When asking multiple people for advice, the person asking could also bring up previously heard points of view and see what everyone else thinks of that opinion. Once the person asking hears many opinions, and opinions on others' opinions, the discussion created will help them think more about the problem, and ultimately find the right decision.

The final reason why someone should ask multiple people for advice, is because it causes somebody to think about a situation for longer. If only one person is asked for advice, then there will be only one time where it is discussed. When multiple people are asked for advice, it will take up a longer amount of time, and will most likely be at different times and days. This is good because people can change their minds very quickly, and what someone thinks of their situation one day, might not be what they think of it the next day. When more people are asked for advice, all of the time it takes to ask them can be used to deliberate and decide which decision may be the best. When asking one person for advice, someone may only think of a solution to a problem over the course of one day. When asking multiple people, it could require someone to think of a solution for multiple days. This will make sure they think of all possible decisions and outcomes, so they don't make a spontaneous decision.

When asking for advice, it is better to ask multiple people than to just ask one person. This is because asking more than one person leads to hearing more points of view, having more discussion about a problem, and thinking about a problem for longer. Asking one person for advice will limit a decision and it may lead to someone making a bad decision. Asking multiple people for advice can lead somebody to become more open minded about a problem, or even life in general. For these many reasons, asking multiple people for advice is the best way to find a solution to a problem or situation.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
E53B5654C0E2,"I believe talking to more then one person is the best thing you can do if you need advice. Although it can be difficult to talk to people for advice, I believe that it can help you deeply. And now here are some reasons why you should talk to one or more people if you need advice.

The first reason is multiple opinions, because it can help you have better and more advice if you have multiple opinions. For example when i needed help with a deciding if i should still be friends with some people. I asked my dad and my siblings for advice, my dad told me that if they dont make me feel good then I should not be friends with them. On the other hand my siblings told me that I should be friends with them because they said that I had so much fun with them and good times. Then I had to make a decision, and it was a tough decision but I ended up still being friends with them, the reason i stayed friends with them was because we had very good times and I did not want that to end. So me and my friends apologized to each other and we became friends again.

Having multiple opinions is important, but also just having someone to talk to can be just as important for having advice.

The next reason is having someone to talk to, this can help you for multiple reasons like getting better advice and being happy. For example my cousin Generic_Name was acting very strangely and I knew something was wrong, so I asked him what was wrong and he did not want to tell me anything. So then i asked my dad about Generic_Name and he said he is probably going through some stuff and that I should give him some space. So I did, after a couple weeks I started noticing that he was feeling better and I asked him what was wrong. And he told me that he was stressed out because he had a lot off projects due. Then I asked him how did you feel better and he told me that he talked to his mom and teachers to find a solution. Although he was stressed out and he did not want to talk to people he did talk to people and it got better.

Having someone to talk to is very important for advice but just making better decisions from having multiple peoples advice is just as important.

The final reason is making better decisions, making better decisions can impact your life majorly. For example I saw this TV show named beyond scared straight, and it was about kids who have done bad things that go to jail for a day, and they talk to inmates and see how making bad decision can lead you into jail. Then on one of the episodes there was a kid named Generic_Name, and he was on beyond scared straight, and after seeing the jail and getting advice from the inmates, officers and other people he still ended up in jail. So then more kids came into the jail and saw Generic_Name, and Generic_Name gave them advice and all the kids were scared because one small mistake could lead you in to jail. and after that none of the other kids there got into jail, because they made the right decision from Generic_Name's and other people's advice.

Making the best decisions are very important, but know lets take a review.

In conclusion, I believe that talking to more then one person is the best thing you can do for advice. There are many reasons for having more then one person to talk to for advice. Like having multiple opinions and having someone to talk to and just by making the best decision that you can make.                ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

400715BAA227,"Have you ever struggled and needed help? What did you do to fix your problem? Asking your friends is a good option but a lot of times it's not good enough to just ask one person. When seeking out for advice, it is beneficial to talk to more than one person because it eliminates or decreases bias, you get multiple opinions from different perspectives, and you can find the most effective option to fit your own needs.

Many people have their own ways to solve certain problems and therefore have their own opinions on how to solve the task at hand. When you ask more than one person for advice, you can see what has worked for certain people and apply the different strategies to your own problem. Everyone needs some advice including players in the National Hockey League or in any other professional sport. Athletes always get advice from many coaches and each coach has their own style. Athletes then use the advice to see what is most beneficial. Asking for more than one person for advice won't guarantee that your problem will be solved, but the probability of success if substantially higher because you have other people's experiences to get you closer to your solution.

On my hockey team I am currently assistant captain and sometime my teammates come to me for help. For example, one of my teammates asks me what he needs to do when he below the goal line. I always give him my opinion, but i always suggest that he also asks for another opinion. Because we are not the same, my strategies won't necessarily work for him. When we start playing our games, he can try out the different strategies and see what is most effective. Now he is able to adjust and use the most effective solution to get his way out of the problem

Lastly, Asking multiple people is great because you can find the most effective option. I applied to three private schools and you had to write an essay for all three schools. When I was down at Texas, I was proof-reading one of my essays and was getting ready to turn it in. My mom and I were already proofreading but we chose to get multiple opinions on my essay. We ended up getting my aunt and my older cousin to help produce the best final copy of my essay. We were all collaborating and talking to make sure we all agreed on the errors and the best way to fix each problem. Even though I had my own ways of fixing it, it was not the most clear and concise way. The final product ended up very good and I ended up getting in to all three of the schools. This showed that getting multiple opinions on a certain task can lead to the best product or solution.

Getting multiple opinions is helpful because it eliminates or decreases bias leading to a overall better product or solution. Even professionals such as book authors need people to constantly check over their work and to give them feed back on their stories. Everyone needs help here or there along their lives, but all you have to do is ask. Getting multiple opinions will help eliminate or decrease bias, you get multiple opinions from different perspectives, and you can find the best most effective option.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
7E7976B1BD71,"Does asking for peoples advice on a matter help you or does it make the situation worse.

Well I believe that asking for some advice can have its pros and cons.

For example one pro can be that by asking for someone advice it can open up more ideas on the problem that plagues your mind, but a con can be that by adding a new idea into the situation, it could build up more stress and anxiety to get it done or solve the problem.

But I think in all honesty that getting more opinions can be good and make it easier for you to make best choice.

By listening to others opinions, the choice you have may broaden allowing you to make the best choice.

Which in turn could lead to more and more good choices in your future.

Another reason why asking for other peoples opinions, is that everyone has a different opinion, therefore has different ways to solve the same problem.

Trying to solve things on your own can lead to a complete disaster, so asking for others help can really make things less stressful and easier for you.

Also by asking for others opinions you can build trust between you an the people you ask.

By building more and more relationships, you have more and more people to talk to about your problems and can help you fix them.

When listening to other peoples opinion there maybe things you don't agree with, but you don't need to completely dismiss the idea instead you can let them finish voicing the idea then give your own spin to it.

By listening and not stopping them, you have helped to build your patience, listening skills, and your possible choices in the situation.

So you see by asking for others opinion you can, build new and better relationships, relieve stress, build important social skills, and see the bigger picture to choose the best course of action.                      ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
62EA3F855DB2,"It is a better choice asking more than one person because when you ask them what's your problem or question most of them are going to say something else while some are just going to say the same thing. But it's not a good idea just asking your problem or question to one person. Because that person might be wrong and not know ask your examples:mom,dad,ant,uncle your friends anyone you trust and thats how you get multiple opinions and when your making a better choice by asking anyone you know. But don't ask one person cause one that person might not know and two it's not a better choice by asking only one person and sometimes you might not trust that one person by his or it's idea.

Conclusion that you should ask more than one person so you can get more multiple opinions and you might get the right answer of your problem or question by the right person.

87B3B5E45156,"People ask for advice all the time. Other people's input can help us consider different possibilities before we make a decision. Based on what you like or dislike, you can make your decisions, but going on our thoughts alone can make decision making hard and stressful. One person's opinion can help us make decisions, but one person does't represent many different ideas. They can only give a few. When you have others opinions on something, then you can also consider those opinions when you go to make your decision. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This is helpful because they can consider the ups and downs of a decision. Multiple opinions can also help us prepare for challenges, and give us a sense of finality when we make our decision that we have thought about it, and taken into account many different opinions.

When people make lasting decisions, knowing the consequences of that decision are important. When you talk to more than one person about making an important decision, you can get a clearer picture on how things will play out. An example would be if someone were going to steal something. If they asked multiple sources, then they would get multiple responses, like ""stealing is bad"" and ""if you get caught stealing, you might go to jail"" or ""stealing is good. You should try it"" . Depending on their motivation, and the advice they get the person could say ""i'm not going to steal"", because of all of the drawbacks. If that person had only asked one person, and that person had said ""stealing is good"", then the person considering stealing is in trouble, because if they make their decision with the advice that stealing is good not knowing the consequences, then they could get into legal trouble. If you only get one opinion on what we are trying to do, then we can sometimes get the wrong advice. Another example is if someone is trying to ask someone out on a date. If the person asks more people, they can get a better understanding of how that scenario will take place. With multiple opinions, you can consider the up: the person you ask out saying yes, or the down: The person you ask out saying no. When you way all of the different opinions like ""go for it, you have nothing to lose"" to ""don't do it, because she doesn't like you"", you can get a better understanding of what will happen in that moment, because you have opinions that help you. When you have more opinions on a decision, and you know the pros and cons, you can use that information to make good decisions.

When you ask multiple people for advice, there is a better chance of you making a better decision because you are armed not only with your own opinion, but with many others. Often, if there is a challenge that you face, having many people helping you will give you more of a chance to overcome the challenge. We see this in sports. I know this is true, because in hockey, when I make a bad play, I will talk to my coaches and ask what I could have done better in that moment, and I will also talk to my linemates. My coaches will tell me to skate the puck and drive the net, but my linemates will also give me details that I had not noticed while on the ice, like ""hey, I was open on the back door, try to hit me there and I'll have an easy tap in"". When I have these opinions in mind, the next time I am out on the ice, I try to implement what my friends and coaches told me. Not only does asking for others opinions make you a better sports player (if you play sports), but it makes you a better person, because you are asking people questions, making you a proactive person. The more input you get from people can help you to overcome a challenge whether in sports or in life.

A final reason why asking for multiple opinions is good is that it give you a sort of sense of finality about your decision. When you take the time to think about a decision, you have a lot of things to consider. If you go back to the stealing example, you have to consider different things. You might be stealing because you need to feed your family. Trying to make that decision on your own can be tough. When we take into consider the opinions of other people, we have help making that decisions, and once you make the decision, you feel a sense of completion. This is good, because you could stress out about making a decision, and now that it's over you don't have to stress anymore, because you made the decision and took into account everything that could have happened.

Asking more than one person for their opinion on a decision is good, because you can consider the pluses and minuses of that decision, you can prepare for a demanding time in your life, and once it's all over, you have a sense of completion, that you got it done, and now you can worry about other, more important things. When you ask for more opinions, you can overall get more things done, because you consider more possibilities in the same amount of time compared to just asking one person. When you get more opinions, you can make better decisions, and you become a better, more proactive person.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
E5F378BE5F7C,"one day on Feb 29th, Generic_Name did not have the best looking shoes at school. He started getting bullied and he had multiple choices but wasn't aware of all. Generic_Name started asking people for advice. Therefor he has got multiple point of views on his own situation. Although he could use some help, that still did not mean every point of view would make his problem the best.

advice was gvin and point of views but not every single one made his situation worse. Generic_Name uncles had started giving advice, although Generic_Name friends gave him advice to. Generic_Name knew for sure it still was right to go to older people like adults. some friends said you could fight the big bully, by better shoes and etc. Some of the adult point of views was, tell an important person at school, teachers, school workers and etc. was some of his advice able to help? If so how can the advice help? advice could help for many different situation because almost everybody has advice from past events that happen to them which is good because people can share there advice to help other people.

How can advice help? advice can help you in a situation, but also if you get the wrong advice it can cause the wrong thing to occur and a bad idea for the future. advice can help you understand the situation from a few people thinking and opinions. Ex:

imagine an puzzle, your thinking is a piece to the puzzle but when you get multiple thoughts from others, which is other point of views that can help you gather everybody point of view and advice. When you get different information you can put all the different advice into one whole point of view on an situation.

My great great grandma always said

""just listen to some advice it can help through stages of life.""

Always be open minded some people can give you negative advice. Although you can think advice helps, it can help if others are giving it to you positive. Most likely people who give good advice they made it farther on from one of there own mistakes or situations they had to deal with. some people want different reactions and try to cause you to do negative actions and negative things although its better perspectives and advice your able to get.

Although advice is mostly good and helpful. You're still getting an part of an opinion, when getting an part of an opinion its still and idea. Although you are getting opinions its your job to turn all the opinions to your own idea or which you think is best to help yourself out in your own situation. When others are giving you opinions you still have to keep in mind that it is an opinion and its not always the right thing even though opinions are in the vocabulary when we have an conversation about others giving each other advice. Most advice you should most definitely pay full attention to, and use and dont take for granted an put some use to it because in life advice can always help you and get you some where farther.

it can be very stressful to make some decisions , or to solve particular problems. and stress isnt pleasant , so it would be smart to get stress of your back ,so that the design you make, or the problem you solve . and a way to do that is to ask someone who is experienced, and that knows what to decide.

or that knows what you can do to improve your situation , or knows how you can relieve stress and not think about what you should decide . so its very helpful if you console someone with experience , and intelligence . it can make the outcome very good , and it can help with similar problems in the future.

and this can make you more experienced with what you were trying to figure out ,or solve. you could have made a mistake or made the wrong design, and know you know what to do because you learned from the last time. or maybe you made the right decisons ,and know you know what to do . and you can help people with the same problem, or lesson , and know you know how to help them make the right one. and if you help them figure it out then possibly they could help someone in the future with the same problem as they did, and as you did . that way you and the person you helped , can help other people that also had the same , or similar problems and that is why its a good, and smart idea to seek others opinions in tuff situations, or problems . it can change the outcome and make the decision you make a good one . ",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
3BB2C60B97E4,"Hey Generic_Name, can I ask you something? Sure, whatÂ´s up? said Generic_Name. Well I was wondering,do these shoes match my outfit or should I wear my Vans? Generic_Name told me that, Those shoes are super cute but they donÂ´t match. Sometimes I dont know what to wear or does the outfit match. So, I ask my friends and family their opinions. I believe you should ask people their opinion about certain things because people can guide you in the right direction and the personÂ´s advice might be helpful.

First of all, I feel like people opinions can guide you the in the right direction because most of the time, certain people want whatÂ´s best for you. For example,at school you come to learn. The teachers do as much as they can to guide you to success. In order for them to do that they have to share their opinion with you. Anyways, opinions can also save you. Save you from getting in trouble and looking crazy. I know because with the right personÂ´s opinion, you can be guided in the right path.

Next, opinions are sometimes helpful advice. Reports have shown that 78% of people in the world ask others for advice and they succeed right after they get it. Opinions can make you feel good while other opinions donÂ´t. I know because when I ask people opinions about certain things, I want their opinion to make me feel good but it donÂ´t always. I had to learn that itÂ´s not about what you want to hear itÂ´s about what you need to hear because thatÂ´s the whole point of an opinion.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that you should ask people their opinions because it could be useful in your future. The opinion could lead you in the right pathway. It can also be very helpful advice in which you will use forever. Maybe you will even give the advice to your friends and family. I hope you agree with my opinion. Thank you.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
DF4A18C70D2A,"If you're reading this paper than you must want to figure out why someone seeks advice from multiple people. Well you're in luck! There are many reasons why someone would ask multiple people for advice. I'll list a few. They might seek multiple opinions on something, they might want comfort for the decision they made or want to make, or they might feel more comfort talking to multiple people.

Let's go into detail with seeking multiple options. A lot of people want to have multiple options because it normally gives better options to choose from. There is a down side though, you have to talk to people you trust. Otherwise if someone you don't trust is there, than they might spread a rummer about you. Although it still is a remarkably well way to find advise. Always think of the downside before using this method.

Now let's uncover the dark secrets to the comfort method. The comfort method is normally used for seeking comfort in the decision you want to make or have made. It cannot be used for trying to find the most possible options though. It is used for a yes you should do it or a no you shouldnt do it type answer. I personally do not like this method it does not work well enough in my opinion. Remember only use this method if you are seeking comfort in your answer.

How about we look into the people method. The people method stats that some one might seek advise from multiple people, because they might just like people. I know it sounds crazy, but people like being around other people. This method is used for the extroverts. If you are a introvert this is not the method for you. Fair warning though pick wisely who you talk to, because they might spread a rummer if you're not to careful. Remember only use this method if you are talkative.

I Think that all of the methods we have covered so far are very useful. One of the things I want you to remember following today is that remember the downside of each method before use of it. In conclusion I hope you also remember the three methods, multiple opinions, comfort, and people methods. If you remember those you will be able to figure out why people seek advise in groups. So do not forget this information!",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
5EF21F142C51,"Have you ever wanted to seek others opinion on a choice that you had to make?.Seeking others opinion on a choice you have to make is right. I think seeking others opinion on a choice that you have to make is good,because people can help you make the right choice for your self,learn what they would do if they had to make the same choice as you,and learn new ways on making that choice

One way you can seek someone's opinion on a choice that you have to make,is by asking people what they would do if they had to make the same choice as you. by doing this you will known their opinion on making that choice. Most people don't ask others on what choice they should make,because they think that people would make fun of them on making a choice on a certain topic. For example when someone has to make a choice on if they would buy some toy against buying a video game. I too have been in that type of problem. Another example is making a choice between wanting to get something you like but there are more than one things you could get and your friend making fun of what you say you want to get. To sum up my first reason of why it is good to seek people's opinion on making a choice,because you then can use others opinion to make your choice.

Another reason of why you should seek others opinion to make a choice is to get help on making the correct choice. One way you can get help with deciding on a choice is by learn the steps of make a choice. One way I learned the steps of making a choice was from a book my mom had got me to read. The steps of making a choice are first think of all the choices you have,then checking which ones you like and they suit you,and finally making your choice!.One other way is to ask friends and family to help you decide on your choice. A example for asking your friends and family to help you make you choice is,One day you had went to the video game store and you see two video games you really want but you only have $70 to spend,so you ask your brother on which one you should get and he says the racing one,but you don't known if you should save more money so next time you get both or just buy one now.

Lastly,My final reason for why seeking others opinions to make a choice is right,because you can learn different ways of how you can make your choice. One way you can make your choices is by finding all the possible outcomes. Another way you can decide on what choice is by asking friends and family give you ideas on the different choices you have and which ones are the best for you. An example from my life I have is,one time I was going to the ice shop and me and my brother did not known what favor to get,so I said why don't we try the new favor,because we had not ate before,so I think my idea for what we should get was good,because I came up with a new choice that we never had thought of before.

In Conclusion,seeking people's opinions on making a choice is good. I think seeking others opinions on a choice you have to make is right,because you can learn what they would have done if they had to make the same choice,help you make the right decision,and learn new ways on making that choice.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
42289AA391B4,"""Ahhhhhh what will I do?"" Generic_Name furiously said. Her mother Generic_Name replied back with, ""Well honey, my opinion isn't always valid. You can always ask your friends, dad, and your sister."" Generic_Name had wanted to paint her room for a long time now. She just couldn't decide what color she wanted to paint it, because of this, she had become furious with herself. Generic_Name thought to herself about how asking more than one person could help her make her best choice. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, because someone's advice may differ from others, they can cast a vote by asking many people, and someone may be giving you bad advice.

First off, an opinion is your choice and it's the way you view things. Your opinion does not have to match up with someone else's. When someone asks you for advice, your advice maybe be different from the other person that they ask. For instance, I may think that mango ice cream is the best flavor of ice cream, while my friend thinks that vanilla is the best flavor of ice cream. Many people many not agree with your choice but that's okay because they have their own preference. If Generic_Name asks her friend Generic_Name for her opinion she might tell her to paint her room blue, however when she asks her other friend Generic_Name, she might tell her to paint it pink. This also helps Generic_Name by giving her more ideas and options.

Another reason for asking multiple people for their opinion, is that it allows you to cast a vote and take majority for the win. Although you are asking different people for their opinion, some people may have the same opinion as another. Specifically, when you are getting the same responses you can start to tally them up and make your choice the one with the most votes. As congress men Jeff Standhill once said, ""Casting a vote works as the best method when you're striving to make the best choice possible."" For example, congress casts a vote across the entire nation, in which citizens vote on the president, each and every citizen gives their input on who the president should be. Casting a vote assures that you didn't just take one person's advice and leave the other's out.

Lastly, when you ask a certain individual for advice, they might give you the wrong advice. They could do this deliberately, or it might be by mistake. For example, Generic_Name's mom might have been giving her the wrong advice because she might have not known what to say.

By asking many people, you most likely won't take the wrong advice into consideration. Likewise, if you asked a person for advice on how to be someone's friend, and they didn't like that person, they might tell you the wrong advice so you don't become friends with them. For all of the reason stated above, it is important to seek for multiple opinions to make the best choice.

In conclusion, asking many more people besides her mom helped Generic_Name in various ways. At last, Generic_Name concluded that her she was going to paint her room light blue. Before she came to this conclusion, she asked all of her friends a question. She asked, ""What color do you think I should paint my room?"" As all of her friends gave their suggestion, she put a vote down for each color. In order to make her best choice Generic_Name, took multiple opinions because someone's advice may differ from others, she was able to cast a vote by asking many people, and someone may have been giving you bad advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
C6278E01D797,"Many people think that seeking opinions from more than one source can help make a smarter, easier, and all in all a better choice. Most people think that because seeking opinions from others will often lead to the individual making the best choice. Getting opinions from others can not only lead to making the best choice but also it can relieve stress and and make the individual feel accomplished as well.

Getting opinions from others can help you make better decisions in the future because if you have a good experience you can always ask for opinions. For example if you are making a tough decision and you ask for opinions and they are really helpful you would probably ask for opinions again in the future right?

Getting opinions from your piers will not only help you in the future it can relieve stress as well as help the individual feel accomplished of themselves. For example if you make a tough decision backed up by you piers wouldst you feel relieved of stress and abolished? Not only that, if you are making a important decision that takes a lot of time and you get multiple opinions that help that can relieve stress as well.

In conclusion seeking and getting opinions from more than one source will help you make a better choice. In short getting opinions from your piers can help you make a better decision because it can help you make decisions in the future as well as relieve stress. In my opinion seeking and getting opinions and advise will make making decisions smarter easier and all in all better.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
AE044D6DE72C,"So scientist's have researched and discovered that when someone is making a hard choice, people often ask others about their opinions. Therefore scientist's have also found that when the person gets other peoples opinions, that the person normally chooses the better opinion and makes the better choice. Also when you get other people's opinions you get more and more knowledge about the choice that you are about to make. Another thing is when the person gives you their opinion don't deny their opinion, you need to listen to what they have to say and don't just ignore them.

Secondly, you should never let someone encourage you to make a choice, but you should let someone tell you their opinion that away you know what you might like and want you don't like. For example say that your going out and looking for a job you might ask your friends that worked at one of the jobs that you are looking at, and they might tell you their opinion about the job. So then you can go and research about the job and see if you like it or not, then now you are ready for the job and you now know what to kinda expect.

Furthermore, sometimes it might be good to ask your friends for their opinion on things, but other times it might not be the best time. Like say that you want to go to a football game with one of your friends, but your friend doesnt like the football teams that you are going to watch so that might not be a good time to ask for your friends opinion. So some of the time you might have to make your own choice and you might not be able to ask for your friends opinion.

Lastly, honestly when your making like a major decision in your life, I would honestly use your gut to make the choice instead of asking for your friends opinion. Then other times when it's not such a major decison then I would maybe ask your friends. So just remeber the next time your making a big or small decision maybe ask your friends for their opinions first then make the decision.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
ADD688C18040,"It was a normal day at the lunchroom when I noticed a new girl standing in the lunch line. She started to walk to the empty lunch table where she sat by herself, because no one invited her to their table.""She smelled funky and looked funky too"" I thought to myself. I turned to my left to tell Generic_Name about the girl. I quietly whispered in her ear,""Do you see that new girl over there?"" She looked behind her back and gave her this nasty look. ""Should we go talk to her?"" I asked. ""No! she's not like us"" Generic_Name exclaimed. I listened to Generic_Name and never got the chance to talk to her, and now she's one of the most popular girls in the school. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they see from a different point of view, they hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved, and it makes them think twice about which advice suits them best.

The first reason for seeking multiple opinions is because you see from a different point of view rather than just one person. When I'm having a problem with something I always ask multiple people and see what they think I should do. For example when you go to the Ice cream shop and you always get Chocolate but you got bored from it. You ask your sister on whether you should try a different one this time and she tells you,""No, it's probably going to taste bad."" You end up getting Chocolate and it just doesn't taste good anymore. You regret not asking your parents. And you lost a chance of trying something different because just one person thinks it's not a good idea.

Another reason for seeking multiple opinions is to hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved. For example you are going dress shopping for Prom. You pick out a couple of dresses and try them on. You pick out your top two and ask your friends which one they prefer. Some picked the Red one and some picked the Purple one. You're torn on which one to get, but hearing other people's opinions helped you pick. Finally you decide to get the Red one because it was picked the most. Just listening to what other people have to say and the things they point out that you didn't notice help you make a better choice.

The final reason for seeking multiple opinions is that it makes you think twice about which advice suits you best. For example I'm in the store at the Smithsonian Zoo and I can pick one bracelet. The first bracelet has my favorite animal on it but it's not cool, and the second doesn't have my favorite animal on it but it's cool. It's a tough choice to make but you always have to think of what suits me best not what suits the other people best. I shouldn't just buy the first bracelet just because everyone thinks it's cool. If I like the other one better then I should stick with that.

It was a beautiful day during summer. I woke up feeling the warmth of the sun against my skin. I slowly got out of bed and went to brush my teeth and get dressed up. I had two choices to make. So I asked my parents and my sister if I Should wear noodle straps with jeans or a dress. Majority picked noodle straps with jeans, and so did I. It was a great choice because it was really hot outside. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they see from a different point of view, they hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved, and it makes them think twice about which advice suits them best.   ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
85E4A10D0918,"Do you ever feel like you need to ask multiple people for advice? This is something people do everyday to make sure what they are doing is going to benefit them or hurt them. When we ask for advice its always better for you to ask more than one person because it gives you more to think about if this is really what needs to happen or is this just a waste of my time. It also can help you chose the best way to go forth with your plan. Second, it makes you think if the advice you was giving is going to affect you in a positive manner. For example, I once ask if I was to move to a new family are they going to help me finally settle down my journey in Foster Care or are they just going to be a set up. So, this made me talk to many social workers, because I want to have what was best for me and my future.

Third, When you get the advice that you need you are able to narrow down you choices and chose what is going to work the greatest. This will also make that feeling in your gut disappear because you will know what your doing won't effect you negatively. Also when talking to someone for advice like you mom, dad,or grandparent they will tell you advice that will truly benefit you and help you succeed in your life because they will only want what is the best for you, which makes it easier to plan out the best option for yourself. In other words, asking more than one person is best because it helps you figure out what is best for you and your future.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
1D828863ECB6,"I remember when I was younger, I used to think that I could solve every problem myself. I was wrong. People always think they know best, but this is seldom true. Everyone you see walking past has faced their own set of unique challenges, and consequently each person holds a knowledge that could prove beneficial to you. Seeking advice from more than one person can help someone make a better choice, because it allows the person to consider other's experiences, perspectives, and enables them to make a less biased, more sensible decision.

Listening to the experiences of others is critical when it comes to making a good choice. Ask for advice from someone who is older and wiser. Someone with additional life experience. While it may sound cliche, your elders do have valuable lessons to share. Additionally, this life experience could include bad decisions that they, themselves, have made in the past. Learning from the mistakes of those around you is a foolproof way to avoid making a poor choice yourself. Likewise, other people may have been in a similar situation before. If another person has been faced with the same decision, or one that is related to your own, that person will, certainly, be happy to tell you what worked, or did not work, for them. Taking into account the experiences of others increases the likelihood of making a choice that leads to your success.

In addition to life experience, everyone has a different perspective. These varying point of views could allow a person to see their own situation differently. Being able to look at the issue in a new light is, undoubtedly, one of the most important factors in deciding what to do. Moreover, another person might see a solution you did not think of. Putting multiple minds together makes it far easier to solve tough challenges in life. Lastly, in a way, hearing other's perspectives provides you the ability to observe your own life in the third person. Almost as if you have exited your body and can now see what everyone else is able to see. This new vision is useful in preventing you from making a choice that you will later regret. When you consult with others, you are sure to see something you did not consider beforehand.

The experiences and perspectives of other people help you to remain impartial and sensible when it comes to decision-making. In times of stress, people have a tendency to get wrapped up and consumed in their own heads. If you have someone to calm you down, you are far more likely to not make a rash, emotional decision. Furthermore, people are often biased of their own point of view. If you do not go to multiple sources, you may end up making a choice that is unfair to others, or unfair to yourself. Lastly, seeking other people's opinions gives you opportunity to effectively weigh the pros and cons of your options. Each person has something of their own to offer, and it is crucial that you hear the voices of others when making an honest choice. All in all, listening to multiple opinions on a matter allow a person to stay logical and fair when faced with a difficult choice.

All things considered, seeking advice form multiple sources is necessary if you wish to make a well-informed decision. The experiences and point of views of those around you are crucial in staying fair and not getting clouded by your own judgment. Ultimately, those three things that you can gain from listening to what other people have to say, are what is going to stop you from doing something irrational. If you refrain from asking for advice, or only ask one person, you could be missing out on obtaining information that could keep you from doing something you will regret. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
4FD4CE18CCDF,"I think seeking multiple opinions would be better, because you can actually view multiple perspectives and then decide which one is the best. For example, you can make a list of pros and cons to see which one you like the most. Or, you can take a vote on what to do. You will also be able to listen better and be more supportive of other people. You will as well as compromise better with multiple people rather than one specific person.

For example, let's say someone wants a dog. He or she is going to have to listen to many people's opinions about having a dog. One person could say, ""Having a dog is a very big responsability. So don't get one unless you ready to take on the risks for it."" Another person could say, ""It's really easy to own a dog. All you have to do is feed it, wash it, play with it, take it out on a walk, and clean it's mess."" After he or she listens to both people, he or she makes a pros and cons list and decides which side has more and which one is the best.

Another example, someone wants to play a sport, but it can be too dangerous. One person says, ""Don't do it. It's not worth risking your life and slowly dying in the hospital."" Another person says, ""Do it! It's not only fun, but it can also help you be more cooperative and you are being active."" Again, someone can agree with both answers, so that's why people need to compromise, to both get what they want.

One example of a compromise, you want to watch the new movie

Billy Madison.

However, you are underage. It can work out if you ask someone if he or she has ever seen the movie. If yes, ask he or she if there's any scene okay for your age. If yes, you will probably be able to only watch the movie once. Otherwise, you are goind to have to wait until you're at the age.

Another example is, you want to stay up. However, your parents never let you. You can talk to them and see if they can let you stay up for at leat just one night. If you're lucky, you will probably be able to stay up during the weekend. But never on a school night.

That's why I think seeking advice from multiple people is a better choice. Not only it will help you more, but, it can also teach you how to deal with real-life situations. Also compromising and making a list will help you with that. It will as well teach people how to listen better and be more supportive of others. Then you decide whether if it's right or wrong. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
4B201D2C2152,"Talking to three people will help anybody with something they cant decide on. If somebody says one thing and then you say another. The only solution is to only get help from one other person. So that you could have three including yourself. Their is no reason to have only ask one person something because when anyone ask three people something, its bound to have a answer because its three people and there is an odd number of people.

Studies have shown, when anybody ask more than one person a for advice then it gets solved quickly. Whenever there is two people and they gives you advice that you disagree with. All everyone should do is just ask one more person for advice. After that then you will finally know just side with the person that likes your idea. The next time you you want advice from one person remember this.

One person is greater than two. If anyone were to ask a group of three. With you making four, there will most likely be a tie. Lets say you pick blue and one other person goes with you, that remains two more and they like orange. that means there is a tie.

So basically what i'm am saying is that. When a group of people have a even number there is a impossible chance of solving witch person to go with for advice. Okay when you talk to one person then it could be helpful to take advice from them. But its a better idea to ask two because now there is another side to just that one earlier.

If your friend were to get in a fight. And you were right there. The principle isn't just going to take you side. They will see if the other kid could tell there side, so that they will have more than one side of the story. The next time you ever take advice from one person remember to just ask one more.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

Many people want more than one input or opinion on something, they don't really want to make a decision right away, or the second a conflict comes up. Wouldn't you want the best advice you can get? Well I know I would!

Whenever I ask someone for advice it's normally for school or homework, maybe even after school activities. I will always ask multiple people so I know that I'm making the right choice, or doing the best thing. You never want to do the wrong thing or make a wrong choice because it could lead you the wrong direction. When asking for advice it could be for multiple reasons honestly. I always go to one of my friends, or even my little sister, you can go to anyone that you trust, or someone you know that gives really good advice.

A lot of people always seem to need help in math, sometimes we just don't understand it, which is okay! Whenever I seem to be struggling in math (or any other subject) I always go to my dad for help since I know he use to be a math teacher! I also go to my friends in my math class to see if they aren't doing well either, my really good friend Generic_Name; (she is super smart)always help me, she gives me really good advice on taking notes and she explains things to me when I have a difficult time understanding, which is why I always go to her!

When you are ever having a bad day, or you have just not been feeling it and you need to talk it out with someone you can always talk to a trusted adult or your school consular; and of course your friends! I always go to multiple people for advice, and you should to! I like talking my problems out and I love hearing different peoples opinions on any situation. When you only hear one persons opinion you only listen to them, and you don't have different people telling you what you should do, but if you go to more than one or two people you have a better chance on making the right decision. You never want to feel like you didn't do something right, we all hate that feeling. Don't be scared to talk to people and don't be embarrassed with any problem you are having to deal with! You have so many people that you can go to for advice or help, make the right choices and do what you think is best for yourself!
