Many residents in Vauban, Germany feel that going without a car was the best desicision they have ever made . The reason why they feel that way is because of this quote ""large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, Along with a home."" This quote is basically saying that many residents in Germany would be spending over millions of dollars for a house and most of the money would be on one parking space that they necessarily dont need. To all you fellow citizens out there thinking if i should limit my car usage or just keeping driving in a car paying for gas everyday. From my poin of view I dont everybody needs a car. Some people just buy cars just to sdhow not knowing the reasons for having a car. Car use up alot of gas and cars pollute the air really badly.

288639E7060E,"What you are about to read is going to give you insight on the advantages and disadvantages there are when talking about limiting car usage. In the next few paragraphs and sentences I am going to state true facts about the advantages and disadvantages of limiting your forms of transportaion. I will also talk about not just the individual advantages and disadvantages, but I will also talk about how it could help or hurt, a community. Now strap down, let's click on those seat belts, and go for a ride, all puns intended.

I think it would probably be best if we started this paper off by talking about the disadvantages right off the bat. Now, the first one that I think everyone thought of right away would be that of, how could places like the United States of America, a country that is thousands of miles wide, convert to what is being proposed in these articles? Where I live now is on the ocean, so on the outskirts of our city, Ponce Inlet Florida, to be exact. If our county, Volusia, was to change to this ideal, then we would have to bike about 3 miles just to get to the bridge to get across the river back to main land. Another example would eb that where I used to live, Howard Suamico Wisconsin, there was a lot of land seperating my old house and the main drag of my town. In the summer, it wouldn't be that big of a deal to just take a bike and gon on a bike ride, but when it came around to it being winter I would probably want to take a car that had 4x4 wheel drive, if you catch my drift. I think that the disadvantages are painfully obvious when it comes to this system, but I could definetley see it working in large citites not unlike Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and so on.

Now that we've finally gotten the disadvantages out of the way, we can talk about how this would help communitites all across the world become safer and cleaner. In the first article I read a quote that I thought was perfect for the advantages paragraph.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happer this way,""

(Paragraph 2, Lines 4-5) This really got my attention right from the get go because It made me think about our daily lives and how I feel when I'm behind the wheel. Im always stressed Im going to wreck my car! The other thing that caught my eye was when I read about the Columbian city of Bogota. In Bogota, they banned all motor vehicles except buses and taxis for a day. A businessman was quoted as saying

""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""

It seems that when the idea of outlawing all motor vehicles and having only bikes and your feet for transportation, people are a lot happier.

In conclusion, I would love to see less cars on the roads, and see more people switch to greener alternatives such as bikes, skateboards, feet, etc. I think it would also take care of the issue of obesity and pollution. The only thing that I find hard to believe is that we would just disband the use of cars all together. I think that we have built so many roads all over the place that finding another use for them would be hard. All in all however, I think this is a great idea. To have communities closer together which would form stronger community bonds and it would allow us to drastically reduce the amount of pollution we create each year.                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
DB781EC6153A,"cars have many flaws nd and in this day and age some are trying to get rid of them. in sime ways that could be the answer to our polution problem but cars or still too important to get rid of. limiting are car usage could be the answer. thats good cuz  it gets u time to exercise,decreases our polution problem,and gives us a chance to enjoy life better instead of speeding through life withy cars.

cars today is one of our leading problems of polution and global woarming. the decrease of car usage will help the enviorment. we fill our cars with deisel fuel wich make up 67percent in a city such as paris,france with a great population. after days of near record polution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

exercise is raelly good for your health. such as walking,riding a bike, or even jogging. anything instead of using a car maybe instead of taking your car to work how about walking to the nearest bus stop. instead of taking ur child to school let them ride the bike to school.

85AEE9062D69,"Wouldnt it be great to hear that Just by citizens limiting car usage they are kind of making the world a better place? Instead of driving from place to place, they at the park, or taking a nice walk around town, or maybe even having a little fun ice skating. Its exciting to hear by just walking anywhere instead of taking a car or a motor vehicle, you are making the enviroment better. Also who doesn't love less traffic in the streets? Limiting car usage has so many advantages, you maybe just have to get out of your car to see it. Imagine walking down the street and hearing the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional sound of a distant motor.

In Vauban Germany, most streets are completely car free. Heidrun Walter said ""when i had a car i was always tense. Im much happier this way."" Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe, and fifty percent in some car intensive areas in the Untied States. Polution is a huge problem, not only for us but for the enviroment. Just by limiting cars,you can reduce gas emissions. In the the passage it says that in the untied states, the enviromental protection agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communites, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.

Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Almost four thousand drivers were fined, and they also had thier cars impounded due to some of thier reactions to the fine. large traffic went down in the capital of france after five days of intensifying smog. In the passage it says that cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. They blamed deisel fuel because france has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. All these car fumes and bad polution can cause many dangers and car usage has a big part in this problem. By limiting car usage, the smog in paris cleared enough on monday for the ruling french party to rescined the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday.

In another place, Bogota Colombia, it was the third straight year cars have been banned with only busses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of seven million. They did this so they can reduce smog. The people who didnt follow the rules while this day was in progress, they faced twenty five dollor fines. this day can do good for many people and can give you many opportunitys that you havent got to do before. In the passage a businessman named carlos arturo plaza said ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polution."" he said that while riding a two seat bicycle with his wife. the usage of cars is not always need, having a little fun wont hurt, taking a walk, going to the park is always a good thing. Even if it rains, that wont stop the people from participating in this day.

Car usage isnt the worst thing in the world but there are many advantages when you dont use them. Polution decreases, as well as smog. you have a day to enjoy the outside world. while you do that think of the gas emmisons you arent putting in the enviroment. People dont really notice it but polution has a big effect to global warming. Just by limiting your car usage, you can be doing a favor not only to you but the enviroment and the world. Now isnt that great to hear?    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D73D85780CE1,"Cars, the pride and joy of many people. They may look nice and go fast, but they hurt the environment more than most people would know. If Americans in certain places used public transit or walked, air pollution would go down by 50% in those areas. It would be better for the environment, and for the human body's health to reduce the amount they drive in their personal car.

To begin, cars are the second most cause of air pollution in the United States behind power plants. Since the end of World War II the U.S.A has been idolizing cars, and they have been focusing on the production of these cars. In Vauban, Germany there is a ratio of 3 to 10 people who own cars. Only 30% of the population owns a car, which is saving the air from quite a bit of pollution. Another event that will help lower pollution would be banning driving cars for a day or two. In Paris, there was so much smog that it was compared and even rivaled Beijing, China; which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. The people who drove their cars on this day would be fined $31 American dollars. The public transit was free of charge because it was being promoted to use, as it helps the air become less polluted. This event also happened in three Colombian cities, Bogota, Cali, and Valledupar. The ban on the cars made many people seem to be happier, and more energetic. This ban has been happening for three years now in Bogota, and other Latin American cities are now seeing the importance of it. The use of bicycles, the public transit, or even walking helps reduce air pollution in your city.

In addition to not using personal cars, walking from jobs or to the mall has seemed to make many people in these driving bans less stressful and much happier. From government officials to the commonfolk of the street, all of the Colombians in Bogota look much happier. Even rain hasn't stopped them from biking to work. One woman in Vauban, Heidrun Walter, said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" She does not own a car and lives a happy life. She even sold her car to move here, along with 57% of other families who live in the town. Not only does the relaxation of not driving make you less stressful, it also makes you get more excersize. Since 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, we can assume that they are one of the healthiest cities in Germany or even the world. If all cities in Europe were nearly identical to Vauban then they would have only 3% greenhouse gas emissions from cars, but they would also have a much lower rate of obesity. Even in some parts of the United States, car emissions would go down by 50% which would, in turn, cause obesity to go down by a gigantic number as well. The use of bicycles and your feet would greatly reduce obesity along with increasing happiness.

Although some people may argue that people who don't own personal cars will use public transit instead and societies without personal cars will not have a decreased obesity. This may be true, but if people use public transit then they are helping the environment even more than themselves. They would still have to walk to and from the bus stops. Which will decrease obesity although it may not be in as big of numbers as we would like.

In conclusion the absence of personal automobiles would greatly reduce the air pollution in most major cities. Beijing could become it's once beautiful city, and Paris wouldn't have to ban driving because of thickened smog. The United States would also never have problems with smog, and we would also reduce air pollution by 50%. Communities like Vauban and Bogota are prime examples of people who do not need cars to survive. They are stress free, and much happier than most car driven societies. Personal cars do much more harm, than good. This is why we do not need to rely on the use of personal cars.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
CFF8F67F1D50,"Have you ever walked a certain number of miles in order to get where you needed to go? In Germany, 70% of families don't own a car and walk to get where they need to go.

In Vauban, Germany, Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars. (Source 1) Most of Vauban's familes do not own cars and almost 60% sold a car to move to Germany. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two. Ms. Walter loved to walk the verdant streets and hear the swish of bikes and the noise of young children playing around. It always drowned out the occasional distant motor of the cars coming form wherever. People are trying to reduce the car usage in the United States as well. In the United States. the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. (Source 1) In America, recent studies shows that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Researchers think Americans don't want to drive anymore. The number of miles drivien un the United States got to its highest in 2005 and ever since than it number has decreased tremendously. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995. (Source 4) Part of the reason the American car percentage is decreasing is becuase the recession and the number of unemployed people we have in the U.S. We can't afford new cars so thats also some of the reasoning behind the usage of cars decreasing in the U.S.

One day in Paris,there was a enforced partial driving ban to clear the air of global city. Citizens of Paris we're not allowed to drive their cars and we're ordered to leave this motor vehicles at home or suffer a 22-euro fine 9 ($31). almost 4,000 driviers were fined and 27 people had their cars towed for their reaction to the fine. diesal fuel was blamed since france, compared to a 53.3% average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. Delivery companies complained on how they couldnt do their job while plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers were excused. Public transit was free of charge for three days. The smog was cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. (Source 3) Bogota, Colombia has made a holiday out of the ban for cars. Every year for one day people cannot use their motor vehicles. Buses and taxis were the only motor vehicle permitted. Violators faced a $25 fine if the rules were broken. This has been the third year the holiday ""Day Without Cars"" has effectively taken place. ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said business Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycles with his wife.

In conclusion, cars have a great use in this world but i think we would be better off without cars. In different countries there is a even or a holiday where it is illegal to use cars. It would be very efficent to have a day for no cars in the United States. It would show people the importance on walking and not to rely on their car to get them places.

84BE3FFF6CD0,"Cars. Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first Model-T. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.

In like matter of this, article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of near-record pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22-euro fine ($31). The same order would be applied to odd-numbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.

Likewise, in the article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a car-free day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having car-free days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.

In conclusion, the use of less cars and having car-free days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn't that far from you and doesn't need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do. So, who's with me?    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
1FF23E154F08,"To some people the limit of car use is very important to them, because they want to stop pollution or things. In the city of Vauban, Germany they do not use cars because, to start off with to even park a car you would have to pay $40,000 plus the price of your house to be able to park it at a parking garage. The city has worked for two decades to make Vauban, Germany better for walking. Which made Vauban home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. This made people all around the world consider to reduce car use, in America the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities.

Other countries strictly rely on car reducing to take down the amount of polltuion in the air. Paris days after a near-record pollution forced car reduction to everyone. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and many had their cars impounded. People in the capital city of France were starting to get sick and get congestion because of all of the smog, and pollution from cars. For Paris to have car reduction they had to ban any cars with odd numbered license plates from driving for a certain period of time. After all of the pollution in the air had cleared enough they had a party for the people with odd numbered license plates to drive again.

In another occasion of car reduction Bogota, columbia had a car reduced day where people would hike, bike, skate, and take buses to work. They as well used this chance to clear pollution of the air and some people didn't mind it, they had a chance of a stress free day and the ability to lower air population. Any violators who chose to drive a car would be issued a $25 fine. Other countries who did not have car reduced days liked the idea of it, and thought they were generating a ""revelutionary change"". Due to these car reduced days parks and sports centers have been an uprise. The days without cars is a campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s.

In the United States of America government officials have talked about car reducing, but have never passed it. In 2005 the miles driven in America had peaked, and dropped steadily after. Michael Sivak said, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn"". Bill Ford owner of For Motor proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.

EC4EDAC13543,"Limiting car usage has many advantages. Such as putting a lot less pollution in the air and having your stress level go down letting you spend time with your family and friends. When we put pollution in the air it ruins our beautiful ecosystem. When driving a car you have to stress about how much gas you have or you stress about if you are going over the speed limit.

The first advantage to not having cars is we limit the amount of pollution in the air. Did you know that in Europe you cause up to twelve percent of its greenhouse gas, and in the US you cause up to fifty percent of that gas, that just goes in the air causing the air that we breath to become polluted. Some ways to prevent this is to car-pool with someone or just to walk there and not drive, you get to help the envirnment and you get your daily workout as well. Some countries have taking the role of taxing anyone who wants to use a car. Like in France, who has a tax policy that makes people choose diesel intead of regular gasoline. France has over sixty-seven percent of cars that run on diesel fuel. Paris has banned the use of cars do to the huge amount of smog they are having.

The second advantage for limiting the usage of cars is lowering your stress level and being able to spend time with family and friends. To help with this some countries have programs that provide people with bikes and other forms of transportation in order for people to get to work. When people don't drive cars and walk with their kids to drop them off at school then go to work it keeps the traffic and all the stress that comes with it down to an all time low. When summer time comes around teens can organize what they do and who they hang out with based on where they are and how far they want to walk to get there.

So limiting the usage of cars has many significant advantages like less pollution and being able to spend time with family and friends while lowering your stress level. So before you get in your car and drive to wherever you are going just take a second and think, can I walk there instead.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

This quote shows that they have taken away the right to park in certain places. ""there are only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home""(S1P2). This quote shows how they are limiting areas to park so not many people buy cars.

Second off, Motorized vehicles are causing a lot of smog. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intesifying smog""(S2P14).

Source two states that Paris typically has more smog then other cities in Europe like Brussels and London. They're taking action by allowing even-numbered license plates to drive one day and have the odd-numbered license plates leave their cars at home and the same would apply to even-numbered plates the following day.

315FF786F120,"In the United States, people are very busy. With school, work, and extracirricular activities in the mix of ""everything else,"" Americans rely on an efficient and preferably fast mode of transportation, and typically, their first resort is car. However, while cars are extremely convinient, they are also very dangerous to the enviroment. Car usage should be limited because there are many advantages, including less smog, less traffic, healthier people, and reduced air pollution.

To start off, when car usage is limited, smog and air pollution are drastically limited too. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States. This is a major problem in many different parts of the world, yet people still continue to always resort to cars, though they have many other options. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants, and the pollutution that comes from it is most detrimental to the enviroment and ourselves. If we limit car usage, we will drastically reduce air pollution.

Furthermore, when car use is limited, it is better for humans. When people do not drive cars, they will sometimes walk, skate, or bike to where they need to be. This is exercise, so it is better for you than just sitting in a car. When people use other methods of transportation like walking, biking, or skating, they do not have to worry about being stuck in traffic for hours. Limiting car usage also saves money. When you do not drive as much, you do not have to pay as much for gas, or paying for parking. These are huge advantages.

In conclusion, there are many different benefits and reasons that we should limit car usage. We can walk, bike, skate, or even take a bus or carpool with other people. It will reduce air pollution, make people healthier, save money, and people can feel good knowing they are doing something good for the enviroment and themselves.                                                                ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Vechicles today are big factor in life  for the reason that cars are used every single day all around the world as transportation and although we have the bus or other ways to get to places , driving is the most selected choice to get to a location. With that being said , vehicles being used everyday has it positives and negatives .  Positives could be how it takes you to a location quicker than riding a bike or taking a walk ,  but have you ever thought all the negatives there is  when a car being used has ?Could you only imagine a world without car? It may seem like a crazy idea to think a world without cars but a life without cars could be a well functional world for the reason that cars could have contribuation to polution in our air or could make the world a so called different place.

In Addition, driving could have a contribution to pollution . Many may not think about it but cars emissions pollute the air we breath. In a article called ""Paris bans driving due to smogs"" it states how "" after days of near record pollution in the air ,Paris enforced partial driving to clear their polution. Also how cold nights and warm days caused a warmer layer of air that trapped cars emission when used in Paris."" Pollution in our air may seem a bit scary but the movement of less driving has already began without us noticing .In another article named "" The End of Car Culture"" it speaks on the subject "" there has been a decrease in America in buying cars and driving.""  Which is a great start to a better future in our world.

Furthermore , We can make the world a so called differnet place for the better. In a article called ""In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars"" it states how ""their world with any cars has been sucessful by making where they live more compact and accessible to public transportation. This new approach now stores can be placed a walkway from main street than malls along a distant hallways .""

Results from this event turned out sucessful , for that other countries have joined this event.""

In Conclusion , A world without cars may seem crazy however just think of all the damages it does to the world than the positives because pollution is not something easy to get rid of and by stepping up to make change as it already began will help us live in  a better clean world.

It says the Vauban's families do not even own a car anymore ,because when I had a car i was allways tense ,but im much happier this way without a car. also passengers cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in car-intensive ares in the united states. They are also trying to change the suburbs vauban home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. This would be the most advanced experiment in the low-car suburan life. And have been apoted all around the world to make suburbs more compact and more accessible all around the world.

Next,"" the passage paris bans driving due to smog"". Tt talks about how after days of near-record pollutins,paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air global city. even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. also congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france,after five-days of intensifying the somg.

And the passage car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota. is talks about some great ways to limiting car ussage. Have a free car day is where u can just get out  have fun while doing all different types of actives like hiking ,go ride on a bike, and even go swimming,this is the stuff that millions of the colombians did some even to took buses to work during that day. End got to work early not considering the traffic jams that they us to have .The only thing that are permitted on this car free day is the buses in the taxis the gas station was even close. This day was for a good cause the goal was to alternative transportation and reduce smog. i think it alos give u bounding time with ur family. And a good way and opportunity to take away stress and lowe air pollution.

Finally, in the end to a car culture .""President Obama's ambitous goals are to curb the united states'greenhouse gas emissions ""a good this is that recent studies shows that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less  and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. but people are also thinking how! when the united staes is the birthplace of the model T some explanations are that .Because of the cash-strapped americans could not afford a new cars and the unemployed weren't going to work anyways.

C69101BEED9B,"Have you ever thought about what life would be like without cars? I bet you're thinking about all the cons but see no pros. Did you know that ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States""? Imagine how low those percentages would be if we stoped using cars. For the past years there has been efforts to try and make citites denser and better for walking. This would not only be good for our environment and ecosystem but also for ourselves. We could use the fresh air and excercise.

""In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""Car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.

""In pervious bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" In Paris, after an intense near-record of polution, they enforced a partial driving ban to try and clear the air of bad gasses. After a few days of doing so, they noticed that car traffic had lowered 60 percent after several days of intensifying smog. In BOGOTA, Colombia, they they created a program that's set to spread to other countries in hope for them to do the same and had a car-free day. Millions of Colombians participated and did everything possible to avoid traffic jams and leave the street empty. Their goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.

A455B4430327,"Many people have car where they live. The thing they don't know is that when you use a car alot of thing can happen like you can get in accidet or the smoke that the car has is bad to breath on if someone is walk but in VAUBAN,Germany they dont have that proble because 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Street parkig ,driveways and home garages are forbidden on the outskirts of freiburd that near the French and Swiss borders. You probaly won't see a car in Vauban's streets because they are completely ""car free"" but If some that lives in VAUBAN that owns a car ownership is allowed,but there are only two places that you can park a large garages at the edge of the development,where a car owner buys a space but it not cheap to buy one they sell the space for you car for $40,000 along with a home. The vauban people completed this in 2006 ,they said that this an example of a growing trend in Europe,The untile states and some where else are suburban life from auto use this is called ""smart planning"". The current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailes the passengee cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive in the United States. I honeslty think that good idea that they did that is Vaudan because that makes cities denser and better for walking and in VAUBAN there are 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. In the artical David Gold berg said that ""All of our development since World war 2 has been centered on the cars,and that will have to change"" and i think that was very true what David Gold said because alot thing we need cars to do we can go anyway were with out cars beacuse some people are a very lazy to walk to place thats why they alot of people use car and i think that it was a good idea that that they did that in VAUBAN so people can see how we really don't need car to go to place from place because we can walk from were we need to go or we can ride bycles with out the use of a car. It good that they are doing that if you thik about your help the earth in way and thats a very good thing to. In the United states ,the Environmental protection Agency is promoting what is called ""car reduced""communtunties,and the legislators are starting to act,if cautiously. Maany experts expect pubic transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six years federal transportation bill to approved this year.

733673FE736D,"Our social lives now a days practically depend on cars. The truth is, we don't need cars as much as many of us think. There's probably more advantages than disadvantages to not owning or using a car as often. In articles one, two, three, and four it talks about reasons why we should'nt use a car and what happens if we do so often; you tend to have a healthier lifestyle, it helps the environment and ozone, and it reduces stress. So really, limiting car usage helps both you and the environment stay healthy and clean.

People tend to have a healthier life due to limiting their car use. In part of Germany the majority of the residents dont own cars. ""As she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."", Article one. This shows how unlike some parts of the world, Germany has many people outside riding their bikes, walking around and many children playing outside other then being stuck inside at home or in a car. In Article four it states, ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends."". This is in New York, one of the cities with the most traffic and cars on the streets. New York made a prgram called the ""bike-sharing program"" which has showed great responces and has kids like the ones before mentioned being social and being more active with friends.

Limiting car usage also helps the environment and ozone. In Paris there was a lot of smoge for days and they had to take action. ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."", states Article two. After this ban the smog cleared a few days later. This shows how easily car can pollute the air and the environment. In Article four it states, ""Since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."". Cars are one of the main reasons for the environment being polluted and it can be stopped easily if people car-pooled, rode their bikes or walked.

Not only does limiting car usage and using a different alternative keep us active, it also reduces our stress. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Bussinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife."", Article three. This was in Colombia where they had a day where no one could use their cars. The people felt relieved to have a day where they could just relax and go outside and get some fresh air. Also in Article one it states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,""."" This was also in Germany in a place called Vauban where more than half of the families didn't own cars. This shows how using a bike or walking other than using a car helps you reduce the stress that you have that also includes driving around others that block your way or speed.

In conclusion, limiting car usage tends to help others have a healthier lifestyle, it helps the environment and ozone, and helps others reduce stress. The chairman of the Ford Motor Company in Article four states, ""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve saftey."". There's probably more pros than cons in limiting car usage because all it really does is make our lives harder. The long term effect of using cars is more important than the short term which is getting to your destination which you can do any other way and it's healthier and cleanier for everyone.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B69DE280DD9D,"Everybody's got a car, right? Having a car to many is either required, out of convenience, or even as a status symbol. What if I told you that cars are becoming becoming a burden to the rest of the world. The negative aspects of everybody owning a car have now taken a physical position amongst the world's issues. Not everybody has realized it yet but there are several cities in other countries that are choosing to take on the issues head on. Let me tell you a bit about a couple of them that I have found to have taken the most drastic of steps and by the end of this, I intend for you to have chosen a side to stand with on the issues that lie ahead.

First off, we have VAUBAN, Germany. According to Source 1, the city has made it outright difficult to own a car here. You would be hard-pressed to find anywhere to park as the city has made street parking, driveways, and home garages illegal. You are able to own an automobile but you must go out of your way to drive to a garage at the edge of the district or pay up to $40,000 for a parking space. The city is trying to make its citizens less dependent on automobiles by designing the whole district to be easily accesible through alternative means of transport and by foot. Their example must be getting our attention because the Environmental Protection Agency is also promoting ""car reduced"" communities. Are we looking at the future of suburban environments?

Next, we have Paris, France. Recently, according to Source 2, the city of France has put a restriction on the amount of cars driving in its streets to reduce their monstrous smog levels. The plan was to have cars with even numbered license plates drive only a particular day and have the cars with odd numbered license plates drive on another day. The plan worked and because of this decision smog levels that leveled near the ones present in Beijing, China which is said to be one of the most polluted in the world have gone down to a reasonable level and they are no longer living in such toxic conditions. Maybe the rest of the world can adopt a similar plan when the need arises.

Lastly, we have Bogota the capital of Columbia. According to Source 3, in Bogota, there is a program in place that banned all motor transportation except for public transit and taxis for a day. In a city of seven milion the need for transportation is pretty high but the citizens who participated managed without a hitch by using other means of tranportation such as by bicycle. This event is part of a long campaign designed to promote smog reduction and alternative means of transport. The campaign has also seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths throughout the city. The city's culture has had no major trouble adapting to the change and places of commerce and recreation have begun to crop up to facilitate the change of pace.

All of this change is beginning to affect our own country as the government is taking notes from the success of these campaigns happening in other countries. According to Source four, studies show that we are seeing a reduction in the ammount of people buying automobiles and earning drivers licences. Is this because of choice or is it because of Americans not having access to enough money to buy new cars? According to the author of this article, Elisabeth Rosenthal, we are seeing the end of the Car Culture. With this thought in mind, which side will you stand with when it is time to decide our future?     ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
84A2D970B603,"The advantages of limitng car use can be a benefit to us. What matter now in days is not how much you drive but what type of car you are driving. Limiting car use can have a great impact on our planet we can protect it and our enviorments. The same enviorments that are currently falling apart. Another adavantage to limting car use is that it can relieve stress in a person and it can actually make a person happier. And last people wont have to worry about getting late to school or to work or even about accidents. i dont know about you but limiting car use can be of great benefit and does have its advantages.

Our earth's enviorments are falling apart. And everyday we damage it more and more with all the polution and carbon emissions. 'It a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce green house gas emissions from tailpipes...Passenger car are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Many cities have been forced to banned car because of the amount of smog was over wellming. For expamle Paris, after days of near record pollution Paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the harmful chemicals. 'Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intesifying smog... the smog rivaled Beijing, China, which os known as one of the most populated cities in the world. So limting car use can have its advantages, it can protect our enviorments. And we dont have to worry about smogs are any other things.

Who doesnt want to be stress free? And thats another advantage of limting car use. I always see how my mom stresses while she's driving which can cause accidents because people are always in a rush. 'When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way' said Heidrun Walter. It woulld be safer you dont have to worry has much about crossing the street. The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drowns out the occasional distant motor. There are many alternative transportation such as hiking, biking, skates, and busues. This cab be helpful for the body and mind. 'Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polluttion'.

The rates of car owernship have gone down. And it continues to go down.'If this pattern persists and many sociolgists belive it will, it will have benefecial implcatiions of carbon emmisions nd the enviorment, since transportation is the second largest source of americans emissions, just behind power plants. But this can have a negavtive impact on the car industries such as the companies ike Ford and Audi. But limiting car usgae can prevent trafiic jams and even accidents.

In, conclusion limiting car usgae does have its advantages. It can protect our Earth's envioremnts, it can relive stress and make a person happier, and it can result in less traffic jams and accidents. I think these things are more important than anything else. Its a great way to take away the stress and lower the air pollution. Limiting car usage does have its wonderful benefits and advantages.

D1D92E256381,"Have you ever thought of the world without no cars? Some people would say it would be outrageous for that to happen, but it has been proven that cars may be actually killing the planet that we live on which is a really big deal. So lets think for a minute how many advantages could come out of not using cars anymore in modern society.

The smog; the smog is whats killing the earth and messing up the clean air. (Paragraph 10 Source 2)

Even Americans are just not buying as many cars and has been declining from its peak since 2005. (Paragraph 32 Source 4)

Roads, Parking Lots, and Gas Stations take up most of the U.S and without cars we could use a main street and have shops on it and could walk or ride our bicycles. (Paragraph 6 Source 1)

First off, cars are just going out of style they are not as popular as they were 10 years ago. In 2005 they reached their peak of selling cars and people getting their licenses but ever since then it been going down hill. Also as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9% below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. (As stated in Paragraph 32 Source 4) There has also been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license. (Stated in Paragraph 38 Source 4)

Second, it would clear up alot of used space that Parking lots, Gas stations and Highways take up. We could use this new space for a Main Street and have shops along the street and people could use their bicyles or they could even walk to the places and go shopping. This would be a very good ide for a small Suburban town with some shops and a Main Street. I do however understand it may be a little more difficult for a big city but im sure there is a way to work something out.

Third, I think this is the biggest problem with cars, the smog. Smog plays the biggest role in killing our planet but whether it be from Cars or Factorys it still hurting us and there are ways that we could stop it. There is a way that we could stop this pollution and harmful effects to the earth such as; hybrids or plug-in cars.

All in all there are many reasons that cars should be abolished but yet there are still a few exceptions to this and until proven cars will still be here. Just next time you get in a car think about what it may be doing to the earth or so-on.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
4AC3EAD1FF0A,"Why are the streets always so jammed!? Everyone asks that all the time almost everyday around 5:00pm. The reason for is because cars being excessivley used nowadays. There are several different advantages that can happen when limiting car usage. The world would be a better place if less cars were used on the roads.

To begin with, why do we the peole use cars? The reason is because it can get us from A to B really fast. But that's only 1 positive for the usage of cars. Think about the negatives and disadvantages of using cars. My 1 main reason of the usage of cars is that it make the world less active. Walking or running is a daily form of exercise, and the usage of cars is limiting the numbers of that. In section 1 Hedrum Walter says that he always was tense when he had a car, he's much happier without one. This is why we should limit the usage of cars. We don't want the people to be tense all the time, we want them to enjoy and relax when using transportation other than cars. Walking will take longer but is better in the long run. You don't have traffic jams, you can go places and areas that cars couldn't fit through and you have many different ways of getting to a particular place rather than just a road. The only repercution that you have to worry about with walking is the rain. But heres the thing, In section 3 Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus said ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" This means rain isn't a problem when walking on the streets. Cars may offer more protection but its more dangerous than walking. This is why places like Germany, Paris, and Bogota are trying to carry out the experience of a ""car-free"" life.

In addition, another advantage of limitiong car use is limiting riots. I know we have all heard of people screaming and arguing in the cars of people in front or behind them. This is a big problem nowadays and it's because of the use of cars. If we can limit the usage of cars than we can hopefully reduce the level of aggrevation on the streets. Alot of accidents happen everyday dealing wiht the usage of cars. Cars provoke alot of deaths if you think about it. If we could limit the usage of driving cars than this will limit the amount of deaths per year by cars. That's the number 1 disadvantages to the using of cars. Walking and biking are my 2 favorite types of transportation because it's smooth, and it's more conveinant. Less accidents and injurys happen when walking or riding a bike. This can also help the streets be less packed which will allow for easier access to certain places. DUI is the main worst tragic that comes from the usage of cars. Many people die everyday because of drunk drivers and thats not respectable. Just imagine if the same person who caused an accident in the car while drunk was drunk on the streets while walking, he more than likely couldn't of caused an accident if he was walking and not driving a car. Just think about all of the disadvantages that cars promote.

Last but not least, comes the president (Barack Obamas) most valuable reason to limit car usage. Obama wants to curb the U.S greenhouse gas emissions, and by that he wants to get fewer cars on the road. In section 4 it shows that ""studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This means that Obama's goal is prevailing. Paris came to a conclusion that they decided to ban driving due to smog. In section 2 it states that Paris air became so polluted that they enforced a parial ""driving ban"" to get rid of the air pollution. They blamed this problem due to the diesel fuel. They figured out that diesels make up 67% of vehicles in France, as to 53% in the rest of Western Eurpoe. In section 2 its pretty much the same reason except Bogota's goal is to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The violators faced $25 fines."" They figured limiting car usage was a good opportunity to take away stress and reduce air pollution. In section 4 the last paragraph tells you what Bill Ford plan was. He wanted to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, onserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""

These are some advantages of less car usage. Many good things will start to happen if everyone could lower the usage of cars nowadays. We don't want the world to have polluted air, we don't want to promote car accidents, and we also don't want under age drivers on the streets. So take in mind the disadvantages of usage of cars and compared the to the the advantages of limiting car usage.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

The envirnment would also be healthier, streets would be safer for children to play in. There would also be less car accidents that happenn because of careless drivers. Americans would have more money as well since gas prices have been going up so much in the past year.

If you have a truck in America, what do you think your gas is doing to the envirnment? Wll, in France they use diesel fuel instead of gasoline, which means 67% of their vehicles is diesel. Car traffic in France was 60%, after five days of intensifying smog, and where do you think that smog came from? Deisel! cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissioms. Paris typicaly has more smog than other European capitals, last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London.

In Bogota, Columbia- a program that's set to spread to the other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets deviod of traffic jams. The day without cars is part of an important campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s.

F69DA030AE67,"What would you do without car usage? Is there such thing as too much or too little car usage? Many residents or travelers are nearby thier destination and don't nessesaraly need a car to get there. Although, for other's they may need to use a car becasue of extended distance. Limiting car usage has many advantages.  For example, in Vauban, Germany streets are completely ""car free"". According to the article "" 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold car's to move here"". Families and friends are much active with each other and can spend more quality time outside of school and work.

When there is less car usage more public transportation will be available to thoose who need it more importantly. Also there would be less polution with the gas and air. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. Due to the smog that was in France, car's was banned. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday"", according to the BBC. Fuel is also a great impact. Do you ever feel like you just work hard for nothing? Money is being wasted on gas, car materials, and car details much more then the things it really needs to be spent on.

Limiting car usage could mean less accidents. Less accidents means less deaths and injuries. Driving could be risky especially in crowdy places with people and other cars. Limiting cars could also mean people getting to know diffrent places often and not just the places they are used to going. Parks and sports centers also have had bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramtically cut traffic; and new resturants and upscale shoppung districts have cropped up. Families are more engaged together and work together to make it to thier destination.

In conclusion, Do you feel as if car polution should be limited becasue of all the advatages. Limiting car usage has it advantages and disadvatages. Many things could possibly happen. According to The end of Car Culture article, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportations traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve recources, lower emissions and improve saftey"". The Mobile World Congress is looking for more saftey ways to transport and get to yout destintation when needed. Due to limiting car-usage families and friends can now spend quality time while getting to thier locations, you can go to your nearby places, you could save more money of gas and car details, and also you could prevent less accidents if possible.                                                      ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

United States has been one of the world's prime car cultures. Its the birthplace of the Model T;home of Detroit where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""Mustang Sally"". Has America passed peak driving? In source 4 it says in recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the  number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, acocording to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company.

Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. The next few years would be telling. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions,just behind power plants. Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vechicle.

China is one of the MOST polluted cities in the world , cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap air comission.

But oh man, oh man France blame diesel fuel to be the problem . 67 precent of diesel fuel is used in france cars. So maybe that statement is correct.

Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaaza stated that ""Its a good opportunuity to take away stress & lower air pollution"" which i highly agree with. Cars are very stressful, they're always breaking down or something ends up going wrong & you spend tons and tons of money just fixing the problem.

845FC5E8A1B7,"Has it ever seem hotter than it usually has to you? The sun's heat just burning the skin on your body. Does it feel like if you want to get any where you have drive in a car because it's to far to walk? Cars are our main source of transportation but it is not helping our enviroment. Gas that is used in cars send off green house gas emissions that hurt the ozone layer, a layer of gas in the stratosphere that protects us from the sun's ultraviolent rays. Many cities have started becoming car free because of this harm to the enviroment.

One of the cities that has become car free is Vauban, Germany [Source 1]. This city has found a way to become car free so that it is good for the enviroment and people can still go to stores or their jobs. What this city does is they make suburbs more compact and make store easily a walk away from a store. It mentions in Source 1 that Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of green house gas emissions. In the United states it is at 50%. All those green house emissions put a hole in the ozone layer making it hotter around the world and letting the ultraviolent rays from the sun hit our body which can cause skin cancer. The design of Vauban is used to structure other cities allowing those cities to use less cars.

The acumilation of smog can be very dangerous. in Source 2 in talks about Paris having to ban driving due to the amount of smog in city. The people driving would be fined 22 euro. The congestion of the smog dropped 60% because of the ban on driving. Source 2 states that France uses diesel fuel instead of regular gasoline due to a tax policy. Diesel makes up 67% percent of vehicles in France. Diesel fuel is harsher than regular gasosline to the ozone layer because it uses different chemicals and burns quicker than regular gasoline.

In Source 4 it talks about the United States using less cars than normal. In April 2013 the number of miles driven per person dropped by 9 percent compared to the past. It also states that the amount of young people driving has dropped 23% between 2001 and 2009. This drop in amount of people driving is very good due to green house gas emissions being the second largest source behind power plants. This drop in cars driven also causes less harm to the ozone layer. Source 4 also says that because of technology and the internet people do not have to drive to see and speak with each other. Instead they can e-mail, call, or text each other.

To conclude, with people driving less cars it becomes better for the enviroment. It allows less smog to build up and hurt the ozone layer allowing ultraviolent rays to harm us. Cities will be designed differently to acomdate the fact of using less cars by making jobs and stores closer to houses.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

If more people tried the ""car reduced"" program the air we breathe would be much better then it is right now.

More places are trying to reduce car rates which I highly doubt but it never hurts to try. Even paris bans driving; paris bans driving because they want to cleant the air of the global city. ""even-numbered license plates were ordered to leace their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)"".  Also Diesel fuel was blamed for the smog in France because 67% of the vehicles in France is made for Diesel. The smog cleared enough on monday but there's no saying that the smog is not going to come back... the plan to ban even and odd numbers plate licenses was a great idea for people of French they should do that every couple months so they could avoid the Smog. In Bogota, Colombia people are also having car-free day which is outstading for the community and for the the people in Bogota, Colombia.""it was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day wtihout cars in this capital city of 7 million"". the goal of banning cars is to promote alternative transportation and redcue smog. the more we use alternative transportation is more money the goverment and the people that doing they're jobs as alternate drivers.""It's a good oppurtinity totake away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

4.12E+80,"Cars produce the second highest amount of greenhouse gas in the United States, being 50% of the gas production in some car-intensive areas. This wreaks havoc on our atmosphere, irreversibly damaging it. However, in recent years, car usage and in turn the amount of gases produced by them has gone down. Many places are beginning to follow the trend ""smart planning"": carpooling, taking public transport, or even just biking and walking instead of taking your own car to work every day. This trend is incredibly advantageous, as it reduces gas emissions and benefits our health.

First is the reduction of greenhouse gases produced by cars. Car-intensive areas have a much higher amount of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter than areas which are starting to use smart planning. For example, Paris has an average of 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter, while London, which has started to use smart planning, has an average of 79.7 micrograms of PM per cubic meter; nearly half that of Paris. This reduction in gases shown by the trend is good for our atmosphere, and good for us.

Preventing us from choking on the smog produced by our vehicles is not the only health benefit that smart planning is providing. Instead of sitting cramped in a car with the only movement being pushing a pedal, people are out walking and biking and getting fresh air. This is not only a physical benefit but also a mental one, as many people have reported that they feel less stressed without the use of cars, such as Heidrun Walter, a citizen of car-free Vauban, Germany. Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

The obvious beneficial properties of smart planning have begun to make it very popular, as Vauban is not the only place choosing to use less motor vehicles. Paris now hands out a fine to every motorist with an even-numbered license plate on one day, and any vehicle with an odd-numbered plate the next. Bogota, Colombia has an annual holiday where anyone using a personal motor vehicle will be fined 25$. Despite rain, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, and skated their way to work this year. Even the U.S. President Barack Obama is trying to curb the nation's gas emissions. Many people in America are already using less cars. With the public transportation system and a large number of people carpooling, the use of cars is steadily dropping. The number of miles driven per person peaked in 2005, and has steadily dropped since. In 2013, it had dropped nearly 9%, the lowest it had been since 1995. Driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009, and there has also been a large decrease in the number of Americans ages 16-39 getting their licenses.

In conclusion, smart planning is incredibly beneficial to the world, and to us. Already emminently popular, it reduces the amount of greenhouse gases in the air by a significant amount, as well as causing some people to walk and bike, promoting excersize and reducing obesity. Smart planning is an amazing benefit to us as people and as citizens of the Earth, and it will only get more popular as time goes on.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B1BA29461847,"Our country's history with cars date back a few centuries. Today, there are many cars from different brands, with different deisgns, and with different benefits. Though all these cars have one thing in common - they emit harmful pollution to the air. We already know that the pollutants given off from cars have caused the greenhouse effect in the world. This has been a main topic for decades, on how to figure out how to solve and reduce the amount of pollutions so that Earth can sustain us. Limiting car usage will reduce the pollutant emission from the cars, it will cause less traffic jam and congestion in parking, and some people are tend to become more relaxed and happy.

The Earth is being effected with harmful gases caused by cars. Our vehicles that we drive everyday, the one we take to work or schools or places you want to see, are the main source of pollutants coming into the air and causing the greenhouse gases. The limited usage of cars will reduce the amount of emission given off. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, France has the most amount of smog in the European countries. This smog has caused warmer layers of air to trap car emissions will cause heat to the country. But when they have put a ban in cars for a while, the amount of smog has decreased. Furthermore, if we continue to reduce or at less limit the amount of time we spend driving or riding in the car, we can help reduce the emissions made. Rosenthal states, ""...emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" If we do not limit the use of cars now, not only will the Earth suffer, people will suffer as well. The limit usage of cars can save the Earth and ourselves.

The constant honking, switching lands, and when reached the destination, a parking is needed to be found. With the amount of cars, traffic jam and lack of parking space is evitable. Pollution also contributes to the traffic jam and congestion. Though if limited cars we used congestion will come down. According to Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" The lack of cars on the road will cause many more people to get to work or school or any place they want wihtout rushing becaus the roads are clear. Moreover, parking space is a hassle to find when there are so many cars everywhere. With less cars means less space for parking, this could save money for the government and invest more on what the country needs. In Vauban, Germany, they had to give up their cars but on the positive side, on the main streets, stores are placed walking distance rather than on a highway (Source 1). With the less amount of cars, highways and roads do not have to be invested in too much rather the money may be used to invest in other important things.

When we are younger, we dream of driving and having a bit of freedom but when we actually start driving it gets tiring. Some people are stressed out when driving and tend to be very prone to accidents. Though when just taking a bicycle or walking it relieves stress. Carlos Arturo Plaza states in the article ""Car-fre day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Stress will only increase when we get older, taking off a load of stress by limiting the usage of cars can be a breather for all of us. Also, people are happy when they do not need cars. Heirdrun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, (Rosenthal)"" When Heirdrum means ""this way"", she is referring to not using a car to get to places. A person should be happy rather than angry and rage because when in a car, some people may do things that could hurt them.

Roads and highways are always being invested because of the increase in car users. If we continue this in the future, there might not be a bright future if we do not stop it. The limit of using cars can cause less pollution in our air, get people to places faster, and make a person smile. This may lead some down fall into the economy and for the employees but with the increase of other alternative to get to places this can lead into a boom in the economy. The positives out run the negatives in this topic. If cars are limited, parks and sports centers will bloom; uneven, pitted sidewalks will be fixed to smooth sidewalks; rush-hour will be cut traffic; and food places and stores will increase. Even the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company proposed ""parternering with the telecommunications inductry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transprtation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety'"" (Source 4). In the end, it is up to decide if we would rather continue using cars or not. So go and choose the side that will benefit not only the economy or government but the people and environment.

Basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

A citizen of the car-less town, Heidrum Walter admits, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Passenger cars are resposible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some areas of the US, according to Source 1. If only we had more towns like Vauban, maybe our impact on the world would be less destructive.

Some towns ban cars for a few days at a time. Paris enforced a partial driving ban after days of near-record pollution. Congestion in Paris went down 60 percent and the smog from the pollution cleared up enough that they rescind the ban. Some people would complain that having little to no cars will be an issue for jobs, delivery companies, or getting children to and from places. There's always a bus, and there's always the option of car pooling! Bogota, Columbia is another town that has done a car free day, except Bogota's is annual.

Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" As a result of this annual car-free day, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been constructed in Bogota. I think more towns should ban cars for just a few days.

865CB0F9D8F6,"In the world we live in today, cars are used by people nearly everyday. To some they are looked at as a need such as water, food, or shelter rather something we want to improve our life. Although, it may improve our lives in the particular moment to some degree, we fail to see the greater and more long-term effects from everyday car usage. The following sources reviews these effects and reveals the problems and solutions we may have to fix them.

One of the more serious and more recognized problems from car usage is the steady increase of greenhouse gas emissions produced from vehicles all over the world. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Vauban, Germany is an example of the effort being made to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions, this experimental city is trying to remain ""car-free"" and in doing so the city itself has to make its own changes. This basic precept is being adopted around the world by trying to compact suburbs and make them more accessible by public transportation.""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said by heidrun walter(source 1). With this new experiment, people are finding ways to adapt and live the changed life while others actually feel better off.

Another serious and impacting issue from car usage is the increase in smog over big named cities. In paris, after days of a near record breaking pollution, paris bans driving throughout the city in attempt to clear up the skies. Diesel fuel is looked at as main problem paris faced in cleaning out the intesifying smog, since a france tax act favors diesel over gasoline it displays an issue the france government must correct in their own wrong doings. A different look towards car usage is that recent studies show americans buying fewer cars, getting fewer and fewer licenses, and also driving less overall. If this pattern continues there will be positive reinforcements for carbon emissions and the environment, since its the 2nd largest emission producer in America. The internet brings a whole other chess piece to the game allowing kids to feel more connected with people without driving anywhere. ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" said by Bill Ford excutive chairman of the Ford Motor Company(source 4).

A program set up in bogota, colombia is a program developed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" said businessman carlos arturo(source 3).

29C5DBB0A339,"Limiting car usage will have many advantages. Not only will it reduce pollution ,but it will also incourage a more healthy lifestyle. Also limiting car usage may help ween us off of our dependence on foreign oil. Car usage has caused a lot of problems economically, environmentally, and physically for the United States.

To start off, car usage is very bad for our environment. The number one cause of air pollution in the U.S. is transportation. So, if we found a cleaner and more environmentally-friendly way of transportation that help a lot. One way would be to reduce car usage. It would be much better if once or twice a week people would ride their bike or walk to work or where ever they are going. I understand that some people live to far away from where ever they are going to ride a bike or walk ,but if you carpool with people who are also going to the same place you save on gas money and you will also be helping the environment.

In addition to helping the environment, limiting car usage will also promote a healthier life style. With the united state's obesity rates sky-rocketing we could use all the healthy lifestyle promoting we can get. By limiting car usage we can encourage people to walk and bike to where ever they are going. Which will influence people to add a little excersise into their daily routine.

Along with promoting a healthier lifestyle, limiting car usage can also help the U.S. withone major problem. Over the years the U.S. has had many great presidents,but almost all of them have promised the same thing, that they will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. But nothing has happened. I believe that limiting car usage will help us in reducing the United states' dependence on foreign oil because if we aren't driving our cars as often we won't need as much oil.

In conclusion, the advantages to limiting car usage are that it will reduce pollution, promote a healthier lifestyle, and it will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. So next time you go to drive your car just think, is it really that far?     ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter. The sound of children outside of the pollution free community is much more satisfying then getting somewhere with dangers involved. A life without cars is less stressful and more free to explore in safety. Driving tends to make drivers uneasy for fear or crash or being late to work from traffic.

""Mr. Sivak's son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving."" Clearly being late to work and stressed is not something people favor espically when getting to work for free is possible. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC."" Instead of spending thousands of dollars expecting an easier lifestyle your neck rests on the chopping block with the blade ever silently above until it completes is mission. Having this ability feels like freedom but it's actually just a fear inducing, death causing machine. A simple healthier life on a bike seems more enjoyable, and even more so when it promotes good health and your life.

""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Not one person can really enjoy a twenty or fourty minute drive to a mall or anywhere for that matter. It's a waste of time, money, and life. Taking a 5 minute walk to a mall is much more beneficial to your body and health than adding gas to your lungs, and it's quicker too. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Children playing outside instead of inside on their new tablet could be our future again. Parents don't have enough time to spend thirty minutes driving to a park when their child seems content on their fancy iPhone 6. Shopping is also a favorite anywhere, but it seems to be drifting online. Taking five minutes to walk to the mall and save money on not buying a car or spending money on shipping will give more money to buy stuff! A bonus is no more wrong clothing sizes or ordering a lotion that smells like toliet water. Ease of lifestyle is a desire that can be fulfilled when waving goodbye to miles of road and hello to a new jeans that fit for once.

Pollution is a horrible topic that everyone wants to stop, however everyone is ignoring one of its sources. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" It sounds like Earth is becoming like the movie Wall-E, and next stop is a ship in space leaving this trashed planet behind. Paris is setting a great example at trying to remove pollution for healthier living and a better environment. The United States has clearly been challanged and in its effort to be the best it followed suit, ""...It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the evironment."" It is hard to imagine a healthy ecosystem with flourishing plant and animal life in our current situation. With Paris and the United States assisting in the idea of other transpot methods not only will animals have a better chance at not becoming extinct but so will the human race. Dying of pollution will no longer be a concern and money spent on poison can go to lifes other pleasures.

Happiness, fast travel, no pollution, and more new stuff sounds like owning a car right? Carlos Arturo has a taste of the sweet life, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Sadly this is not what a car provides because in fact it only reverses these good things.

Cars emit a large amount of greenhouse gases -""choking cities""- which is a large contributer to air pollution. Along with the toll they place on the enviroment, cars cause stress, leaving a mental and physical toll on your body as well.

Cars are no longer as useful as when they were first invented. They provided forms of easier transportation to communicate and socialize with others, reach the designated location within a shorter time, and limit how much people had to walk. They are stilled used for these purposes today, but are no longer neccessary. The internet allows you to ""feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Although there hasnt been a ""solution"" to having to walk, there shouldnt need to be. Cars give people another excuse for being lazy. In Bogota, there is an annnual day known as Car-free day. on this day, cars are banned from being used and only buses and taxis are permitted in this capital city of 7 million. With a city of so many you would think that the day would have a terrible turnout, but many people benefited from the experience. It alowed people to view the world face to face, instead of behind a sheet of glass. While either riding their bicycle or walking, people are able to take in the sites and try new things that they'd usally pass by while driving.

Cars emit a large amount of greenhouse gases -""choking cities""- which contribute to the worldwide problem known as air pollution. Along with the toll they place on the enviroment, cars cause stress, leaving a mental and physical toll on your body as well. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emission. In some car-intensive areas in the U.S. it is 50%. It has gotten so bad that Paris had to enforce a ban on partial driving to reduce near-record pollution. The stress this pollution leaves on the enviroment is similar to the physical and mental toll, caused by cars, on the body. The large amount of car usage causes traffic jams which can lead to stress and aggitation, and sitting in one position for so long can leave stress on the body (cramping.) Cars can also cause mental stress due to the fact that they cost so much. many people choose not to own them do to this fact, but the ones who do are not only required to pay for the car, but also have to pay additional fees for things such as insurance.

The relationship between people and cars throughout the Earth is changing with fewer people buying cars and governments supporting the use of more eco-friendly methods of transportation. Two advantages of this change that I would like to point out is first the improvement in health, and second the fact green house gasses have gone down. These may seem like great ideas, but you may be asking yourself are such advantages possible?

Begining with the lack of pollution, cars can produce Carbon dioxide which causes problems in the atmosphere. The gas traps sunlight creating greenhouse gasses which is responsible for global warming. This would cause problems for future generations with an increase in flooding and other factors that can destroy areas of living, not to mention the fact breathing in the fumes is bad for health. The scary part about the relationship between green house gasses and cars is that twelve percent of green house gasses caused by cars are in Europe. This may no frighten you, but when you take into account fifty percent of green house gasses lie in the U.S., you realize how seroius and frightenning the situation really is.

Another benefit of the lack of car usage is the improvement of public health.

I'm much happier this way,"" meanwhile in Bogota, Columbia a bussiness man said ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" during Bogota's car-free day program. Aside from the stress, people are getting far more fit as they walk or take a bike to their destionations, even in large cities like New York where you'll see people joining bike programs. Bicycle lanes are increasing greatley and in Bogota, 118 miles have already been built.

In conclusion, I would like to point out that out our world is improving. The awareness of government and the people has lead into the creation of bicycle lanes, a lowering in the stress level of the people, and a decrease in green house gasses. This will in turn provide a better future for countless generations of people throughout the entire planet. It's as Bill Ford, executive of the Ford Motor company stated ""pedestria, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""

The advantages of limiting car usage is extremely worth it, because the car brings stress to you and your not that social. Walking or jogging or riding a bike can increase your lack in your social life. Driving can increase the pollution in the air. In source 2 (Paris bans driving due to smog), Robert Duffer says ""cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions."" Also in source 1, Elisabeth Rosenthal states ""while there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and batter for walking, planners are now talking the concept to the suburbs... Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be teh most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life.""

Car-free day in Bogota is set to spread to other countries, a day millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. This day has been going on for its 3rd straight year, violators faced a $25 fine. Reducing car usage helps stress and lowers air pollution. In source 1, (In german suburb, life goes on without cars) says ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Alot of places are seeming to want to reduce car usage, for the better of peoples daily lifes and the air source full of pollution.

In source 4, some people to the age 19-21 have no license or even asked for one even though they live in a place where it could come in handy, they are interested but its not a priority. Also ""there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39- year olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak's research has found."" This section has also states ""a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009..""

At the end of source 4, ""The end of car culture"" it says.. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and in prove safety."" Having a car comes in handy but driving somewhere you could have walked to is pointless in gas and expecially gas prices you need to consider and it causes stress to the human mind. These 4 sources in text evidence have proven that cars and driving will cause stress and air pollition. To limit the air pollution and stress level of your life, start walking to close stores and communities that you may have to go too. Reduce your car/ driving use and maybe your stress level will be maintained by your way in how you choose to change how you live.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
17B88571D179,"Could you imagine a life without a car? Well it seems that many people can. In many cities driving is being ban and officials are putting in place car-free days in order to reduce air pollution emmitted by cars. Communtities are even being built that do not allow cars.

A community in Germany is has been built were it is car-free. Ther is no street parking, driveway, home garages. in this new experinental community car ownership is allowed butyou must park in a large garage at the edge of tcomunity and the car owner must buy a space for $40,000, along with a home. This has now become a growing trend to not uscar and rely on other forms of transportation. Many people feel that this has taken  a weight off their shoulders. othr places are adopting the idea of living car free. If this continues it could drastically lower the amount of air polution.

Gremany is not the only place making efforts to reduce pollution and cut back on auto-useage. In Paris after near record pollution a partial driving ban was inforce to help clear the air pollution. For a day all the drivers with even numbered license plates were ordered not to drive their cars or be charged with a $31 dollar fine and the next day drivers with odd numbered drivers license were ordered to do the same. After five long dats of smog congestion went down sixty percent. Although delivery companies lost revenue, the temparary ban lowered pollution in paris.

In Bogota, Colombia car-free day is a huge hit. this would make it the tird year in a row that cars were banned with only busses and taxis permitted to roam the streets. thye goal of this day s to reduce pollution and premote alternative forms of taransportation. The gloomy weather of the day with gray clouds and the occasional poring down of rain didnt stop the citizens of Bogota from hiking, biking, or skating there way from point A to point B. The turnut was huge and created an enthusiastic enviornment for all who joined in.

In conclusion, the occasional banning of cars, and comunities built were seeing a car would be strnge is an excelant way to reduce pollutin. The air we breath is what keeps us going so we must take drastic measures to ensure our health and keep our air clean.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
595680F66255,"Limiting car usage will most definitly lead to an overall better economy due to several reasons. Less car pollution will clean up the air, there wouldnt be much traffic and people will take local buses and taxis so that would reduce emissions. All around the world, differant countries are doing things to limit car usages and they definitly work.

In Germany, there is a community called Vauban where cars are not permitted unless you pay for a $40,000 parking space. This is helping lower emissions and they have noticed a differance. There are stores and resturants that are in walking distance to the people so they do not need to worry about long distances. When people have necessitys right near them, the only thing they would ever have to worry about is getting to work, but there are taxis and buses that can do that for you so there is no need for a car.

Differant places around the world are also limiting the uses of cars. In Paris, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear up the smog. What they did was made it so odd and even liscence plate numbers would switch off each day so that it would cut the number of people driving in half. If you get caught driving with the banned liscence plate number for that day then you would have to pay a 22 euro fine. Traffic went down nearly 60 percent because public transit was free of charge for the days cars were banned. About a week later, the French party decided that the smog had cleared up enough for them to lift the ban.

In other countries there are special days in the year where cars are not aloud. In Bogota, Colombia, there is a certain day where all cars are banned and only buses and taxis are permitted and violators would face a $25 fine. Many other cities and counties are seeing that these days would help clear pollution and they ar very intrieged by it and more than 118 miles of bicycle paths have been made since the mid 1990s. Many diffrant parks and sports centers have been built across the city and upscale shopping districts and resturants also bloomed.

Many people are finally realizing one of the biggest pollution emissions and are trying to cut back on the number of cars on the road. Everybody should try carpooling or taking public transits and taxis instead of driving thier own cars. It would drasticlly reduces smog as proved by many differant countrys car limitations. Even once a year if they had a day where noone drove, there would probably be a noticable differance in the pollution levels but noone will know for sure until it happens.

So many America's are too dependant on their vehicles but, other places across the world such as; Germany, Paris, and Bogota have began working on this new concept. I strongly support the idea of no car usuage, just think of the benefits that could come from it, conservation of rescourses, lowered pollution, improved safety, and just think of all the money you would save without a car. The possiblities are endless.

Pollution and bad air are problems we face all around the world, and cars have much to do with it. ""If the pattern persists- and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment"" (Source 4: The end of Car Culture). Intense pollution and bad health are problems that are faced all around the world, imagine the positive effects we would see not only in our enviroments but in our own selves if we stop car usage. We need to protect the world we live it by keeping it clean, also keep ourselves healthy in order for survival.

Many families lose loved ones every year due to vehicle related accidents, cars and traffic have a good percentages of deaths each year. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capitol of France, after five-days"" (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog). Congestions has to do with traffic, adults complain every day about traffic and how dangerous it is. ""It's a good was to take away stress"" (Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota). We spend a lot of our lives streesing over many things, why add the stress of traffic and wrecks? We have many more important things to spend our time worrying about, we shouldn't stress over something that we can live without. Taking away vehicles would wipe out stress, traffic, and many deaths a year.

Financal problems aren't a forgein subject. Almost everyone can recall a time in their life either when they were facing the problems themself or heard about a close friend or family memeber going through a tough time. ""All of our develpoment since World War 2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" (Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). Not only people but countries have been guilty of putting cars infront of other neccessities. Many young adults will base their finances around a car of their choice when we all know their are far more imporant bills to be paid. Also, with taking away the centering of cars we have time to face and solve more imporant issues. Taking out cars would give people a chance to get their priorities straight.

This is why I strongly support the idea of no cars, I see nothing but positive results that would come and many other would agree. Improved safety, lowered pollution, improved safety, and money savings are just the beginning. I understand most can't imagine life without their vehicle but change isn't always a bad thing, especially when there's many factors at stake.             ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
814488D5C66D,"Using cars today is polluting the air we breath in everyday, worse and wrose. Having a world free of cars would not only help with air pollution, but with everyone's saftey as well. In German Suburds 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move in the German Suburb. They would sell thier car(s), and live without a car, and live a less stressful life. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two. I'm sure Heidrun wasn't the only one who felt like that.

Having no car wouldd take more stress of your life then you think. You wouldn't have to pay a car payment every month. You wouldn't have to worry about hvaing to pay for gas to get around. Lastly you wouldn't have to worry about getting into a car accident every time you got behind the wheel of a car.

""All of our development since World war ll has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" said David Goldberg. Goldberg is right. We put most of our attention and development into cars, and focus more on them than we really should. We don't really realize what damage cars are causing us yet, and probably won't realize for a long time from now.

Aftrer days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorist with even numbered license plates were orded to leave thier cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. The same would apply to odd number plates the following day. They should not only be doing this in Paris but everywhere to reduce the air pollution. The fine should be higher also to those who don't follow the rules. Unless you havea real emergency to use your car the day you are not suppose to then don't use it.

Not using cars would be a huge problem solver to most of us. It will help with air pollution. It will help with finacial problems by not having to worry about car payments or money for gas. Lastly it will help wiith the stress in people's lives and lower it.             ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
DD20B441F849,"Families all over the world use cars on a daily basis. Cars help us get to places faster and in a more convinient way. Using cars eventually comes to a point were the enviroment can no longer take much of the diesel fuel, therefore car usage should be limited because its releases toxic gas to the enviroment, more excercise would be done, and more bicycles would be put to use. Limiting car usage would not only help people, but it would help the enviroment too.

First of all, toxic gas is released into the enviroment due to the burning fuels released by the exhaust pipe in a car. According to Robert Duffer, ""paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...[last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (pm) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london, Reuters found"" this shows how cars produce so much smog it harms the human beings lungs when inhaled(source 2). Also as stated by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States""(souce 1). This represents how much burned diesel gas we are brething in instead of oxygen. There is a 1 in 2 chance that you will breathe in diesel fuels instead of oxygen, in the areas of high concentrated cars.

Therefore, more excercise would be done by people who limit their car time. Scince more bikes would be used the entire body is in motion ion other to get from one destination to another. Usage of bikes would also help prevent the leading cause of death in America, obessity. ""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation"" these new inventions keep the United States busy and keep them from using cars, a busy city such a New York, would benefit more from the usage of bikes, trains, skateboards and skates because if not it could end up like Paris, a city full of smog(source 4). Bicycles are a great way to get  around easily, ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewaalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districs have cropped out"", this excerpt explains how society has improved the conditions for bicyclist and skaters. The fixing of sidewalks helps bikers stay on a safe and smooth path to their destination. The excercises produced will help the body stay in shape and healthy.

To conclude, limiting car usage is something all people should be aware of. If we limit car usage, the enviroment would not be as harmed by burned fuels, people would excercise more, be more active and stay healthy, and finally more bikes would be put into a good use. Limiting car usage is a great idea and would bring more reasources and needed thinbgs to the community.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B7C81B9A0C1A,"There are many ways a person can get from one place to another whether it is by bus, plane, train or car. Car and truck transportation is one of the leading causes in air polution. Ruducing the use of cars will be beneficial to the public, not only on the streets, but to the citizens themselves.

To start off, the reduction of cars on the streets will cause less stress to the people who drive them. For example, in Source 1 it shows how a woman is happier and the loss of her car has changed her life for the better. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" she says. The tension of being in a car and waiting in traffic can be stressful and cause people to get impatient, grumpy, and even irritated. The woman proves that her life has changed because she doesn't have to go through that anymore. Her car-less life is the one that makes her happy.

Besides that, not only does car reduction cause better mood for people, but it also lessens the air pollution and makes the enviornment cleaner and better for people to live in. According to Source 4, ""If the pattern persists- and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" This proves that when cars are being used less, there is also less carbon emission into the air and that is helpful to the enviornment. This benefits and makes the air cleaner and safer to breathe.

Now with every thing good, there is always a bad. In source 2 it is explained how the delivery companies were complaining of lost revenue. Yes, this will be a problem with the delivery companies, but there are other ways of transporting goods to their destination such as by train, boat etc. Also in Source 2 there were arrangements made for the the cars to go out on certain days, so the delivery companies' problems were not all that bad. The reduction of cars benefits the public more than it what it hurts.

The results of limiting car usage has been greatly proven through studies done (in source 4) and it is believed that it should continue to be limited and or reinforced. The people are happier, the enviornment is safer and the air is clean. There is more help than there is hinder and soon it will be seen throughout the world that cars are better in the garage.                       ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In source 2 ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, it says that when there is cold nights and then it is warm during the day, the warmer layer of the air traps the gas emissions from the cars. There are all statements that prove that the gas that is emitted into the air by the car affects our atmosphere. If there is tons of cars out during the day all at the same time, they are all polluting the air which affects us all. The amount of pollution coming from factories and other things is already way too much for us to be adding even more gas emission into the atmosphere. Also, there are not only little cars but different sizes of cars ranging from extra large to small. Some cars let out more polution than others but when all the pollution from all the cars come together, it is a gigantic problem.

Congestion is something that happens in many places where cars are used alot. In Miami, congestion is a big problem and it is very stressing specially during afterschool hours. In souce 2, it says that when France passed the law in which even- numbered or odd-numbered license plate had a certain time where they could not drive, the congestion went down up to 60 percent in the capital. Imagine the amount of congestion that was avoided each day by passing that law. In source 3, they state that they had a car-free day in Bogota, the capital of Colombia and it left the streets devoided of traffic jams. They also assure that it was a great way to take away stress. Stress is often caused by very long traffic jams in very populated cities such as Miami or Bogota.

If the usage of cars was limited, people would be more interactive. We would see more people walking and riding bikes. We would car-pool with friends and instead of just driving to a place where the person is going to be in a car from point A all the way to point B, people would interact more with one another. Talk to people while they walk, use public transportation and it would benefit local bussiness even. In sorce 1, they say that in the new approach of limiting the access of cars, stores would be placed by a walkside, somewhere you can walk to instead of being placed inside a mall along a distant highway. In source 3, it says that the limited amount of automobiles has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, parks and sports centers have bloomed and even the sidewalks have improved!

If you're stress and unhappy than take a walk, Mrs. Walter walked the verdant streets where the bicycles swish and chattering of wandering children drown out the occasional distan motor.

Vauban has a home to 5,500 residents and they're trying to built houses where stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

Lets take a look at Paris, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. If people didn't follow this enforcement they suffer a 22-euro fine of ($31).

Do you want to go outside and have a hard time breathing?- Nope i didnt think so. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after intensifying smog. Diesel fuel was the cause of that only because France favors diesel over gasoline. This decrease in cars will be better for implications for carbon emissions and the environment.

When you buy a car, you need space for it to stay in. A space can cost up to $40,000 max. That is alot of money you could save for other appliances and daily life products.

In the article Paris bans driving due to smog Robert Duffer said motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine.

And think about it! More stores you can shop at and save more money to shop at those stores because you arent buying gas everywhere you go and paying for car innsurance.

Not only will you be saving things we all wish to save on, we will also gain the oppurtunity to have more one on one time with friends or even family.

Experiencing a day without something you always depend on may seem foolish, considering, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (paragraph 5, Source 1:

) ""Transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources,lower emissions and improve safety."" If more and more people decide to live a motor-vehicle free life, then this could result in less traffic which can result in having enough time for that cup of coffee before work.

Although, if you dont have a car to get to further places that means you would have to take public transportation, such as a bus. When riding a bus, it is obvious that you are not the only passenger which means that you are not the only stop, this could result in a longer ride. When heading some where, its common that the person needs or wants to get there at a specific time, this could be a reason why not having a car could not apply to you.

Apparently, using public transportation or car pooling can give you the opportunity to bond with your friends, who would want that before arriving at your eight hour shift? As mentioned in paragraph 35, ""The rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexiable commuting arrangements.""(Source 4:

I have, by limiting car usuage there will be less pollution, your town will not be not be covered in smog and it'll bring you closer with your community. I think that you (my fellow citizens) should and do want that for you and your community.

To begin, the first positive of declining your usage of cars will prevent pollution.

Pollution is very horrible, it can harm people in many ways. Pollution can make people sick, keep them from wanting to go outside and enjoy the out doors and also can harm the wildlife. For example, big trucks and machinary seem to spit out a lot of diesel which is a lot of pollution which can internally harm citizen's bodies. So do you want pollution in your community?

Next, limiting car usage will prevent your beautiful city from being covered in smog. Smog is nasty and makes your environment (home) look nasty as well. Smog is pollution that travels through the air and allows the sky/clouds to look grey and the air to be filled wih all types of horrible gasses. I'm sure you wouldn't like going out side and seeing your environment be all gloomy and disgusting because of your vehicals.

Lastly, not being in your vehicals all day, talking to people about your life and just being genuine will truely bring everyone so much closer as a community. Being close with your neighbors, talking and walking will all of the genuine people in the communtity will help your society grow. We all want to know our surrondings so why not get out of the cars and go for a stroll, you never know what may be the outcome. Vehicals are overrated in my opinion.

To conclude, I think that you should consider all of the advantages of less car usuage. Not only to prevent pollution, prevent a smoggy community, but to also help you communicate with your family. Now the choice is yours, do what's best fro not only you but your society. Just don't forget all the outcomes of car usuage.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F3928951775C,"Many people throughout the world, would agree that car usage plays a significant role in daily lives. Although some may argue it plays an important role or a not so important role, the limitation of car usuage would be a very helpful thing for everyone, and the world we are surrounded by. There are many advantages to cities being able to control the amount of cars being used everyday. Advantages such as, less pollution in the enviroment by creating less smog, making the cities and roads a lot safer, by lowering the risk of getting into or even causing a wreck, or even something as simple as making your life, and the lives around you much more peaceful.

""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. (paragraph 5)"" Cars are the number one cause of pollution in most cities, espcially ones that have large amounts of drivers on the road in a single day. The author of source one, states in pargraph 8 that ""..some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like not only in developed countries, but also in the developing world, where emissons from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities""  All authors state that limiting car usage, is a great way to reduce air pollution. Paragraph 10, of source two, states that ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" If car usuage was limited in cities there would be less smog, and pollution in the air. Not only would it be better for the enviroment, it would also be better for your health.

Wrecks are things that claim the lives of people each and everyday. Some can be prevented, yet not all can. Think of how many lives are taken each day, due to wrecks because of things like congestion in big cities. Or even things such as someone behind the wheel who is stressed, and driving wrecklessly. A source from paragraph 3, states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Many people, get tense and stressed from the drivers around them. Limiting how much you use a car, can improve things such as stress levels. Imagine how much more at ease you would be if you constantly heard, a bicylest wizzing by you, or hearing children chattering and laughing among themselves, instead of hearing horns honking, loud motors, or even the sound of a car crash.

Roads and streets take up much more space than we think or even realize. With less cars on the road everyday and more people walking, or riding a bike, could only mean one thing; less roads and bigger sidewalks. More cities are trying to make limiting car usage a much bigger thing, ""...in attempts to make suburbs more compact..."" Source one, also states that ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather that in malls along some distant highway. (paragraph 6)"" Getting to these places will become safer for everyone.

As you can see, there are many advantages to limiting car usage, such as, limiting the amount of pollution there is, lowering the risks of getting into, or even causing a wreck, and even something as simple as making it a more peaceful enviroment to live in, not only for yourself, but for others around you. Our world, and daily lives would be affected in great ways, in more cities, and even more countries, participated in lessing the amount of car usage.             ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

If we can lower the percentage of people using cars we can stop air pollution. One reason for not using cars is that you can save money by not buying gas. Another reason is that you can walk and it is a great way to exercise. Last but not least is you can stop air pollution.

If we can lower the percentage of people using cars we can stop air pollution. One reason is you can save money by not buying gas. What I mean by this is that gas now a days are pricy. So when your not using your car you save money. Also gas is what causes air pollution. Gas stays in the air and kills our environment like our oxygen and trees etc .

If we can lower the percentage of people using cars we can stop air pollution. One reason is that you can and it is a great way to exercise. What i mean by this is that some people are lazy to exercise so people just sit down. But with out their car they'll have to walk to their destination. Also when you walk alot you loose caleries and you start getting muscles on your legs.

If we can lower the percentage of people using cars we can stop air pollution. One reason is you can stop air pollution. What I mean by this is that the gas that we put in our cars goes out in the air. With air pollution it can make us loose our oxygen. Also it destroys our trees that we need for oxygen. That is why we need to the percentage of car usage.

I mean can you just imaging the gases and smoke coming out of just one car,Its a lot right well now picture a country full of cars and trucks now thats cause for damage. limliting car use can have advantages on the world and ourselfs as a person. One city in germany is making a change for the better.

In VABAN, Germany population of just about 5,500 people, About 70 percentl of the people there do not own cars as said in source three of  the article,It also states that 57 percent of people sold there cars to move and live there. this plays a part in the advantge of less air polution, ''Fresh air'' when people say i need some fresh air he not really breathing fresh air unless hes sniffing a tree tahts has just gone to phtosynthisis .Not to mention the gas, In VAUBAN instead of having to use the gas for cars it can be used for other day to day things. although there is less polution in VANBAN it is nothing compared to the air polution that has already been let out but to make things better we all have to start somehwere.

less air polution is good but it might take years before we can implimant  a law or rule to have less cars around the world. something good that you can get out of not having a car right off the bat is less stress and being calm.''When i had car i was always tense, i am much happier this way.(source 3) heidrun walker, a media trainer and a mother of two stated that. Now she dose not have to wait in traffic of rush hour to go pick up her kids from school or get groceries all of that is a walk away. Daily excrsics and a nice walk. This is just another couple of advantages that people can get from not having a car.

In my opinion people don't need cars if places are two blocks away. i see it as an acsesorie, Or another toy to play with, But this toy has a cost. If the world for at least one day stoped using cars , They will under stand what is is to live in this small town of 5,500 people are who happy with there life style, hopfully they will understand the advantages towards not having a car.                                                                               ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
1.55E+11,"Fellow citizens should know the advantages of limiting their car usage of drivng less car can reduce the pollution, For example the article ""In German Suburb,Life Goes on Wihtout cars"" it says ""expert says its a huge impedmient to currenty efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpopes. Cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emission"". Thats why its important to cut back, If not... They could ban driving. For Example the article ""Paris Bans driving due to smog"" Paris almost of near the record pollution, so paris enfored partial drivng ban to clear the air of the global city. And there was 1 article about ""Car Free Day Is Spinnning into a big hit in Bogota"" talks about banning cars and only transportation is bike, walk, and busses.

In the article ""German Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars"" people who ownes house has to pay for Parking space stated ""Car ownersship is allowed but they must buy a parking spaces which can cost up to $40,000"" cause of this people who dont have money rather buy a house instead of a car so they dont have to pay $40,000 for a parking space. 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57% sold a car to move to germany.

""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Paris bans driving becuase after days of near record pollution, Which made Prais enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Mortorists with even numbered license plates were order to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine which is $31 in USD. And some drivers dont even enfored the rule for example ""4,000 drivers were fined for not coperating with the rule enforced by paris offical. Diesel fuel was the blmamed since France Car which is made up of 67% of cars fueled with diesels. its a good idea for Paris to ban driving for certain amount of days because it can clear the air up with pollutions.

In ""Car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" they have banned driving for 3 straight years. the only transportation you could get around is buses and taxis is permmited for the day without cars in the capital city of population of 7 million. People who violate the banned of driving could faced a $25 fines, the turn out was large, despite gray clouds thay dumped rains showers on Bogota. As the mayor says ""its a good oppertunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" in this case i agree with the mayor because having a stree-free pollution can lead to a heathier state and a clean enviroment.

""The End of Car Culture"" President Obama ambitous goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions. Many sociologists believe it will have benefical implications for carbon emissions and the enviroments, since transporation is the 2nd largest source of american's emission. For example companys like ""Ford and Mercedes have been rebranding themselves as a mobility companines. with all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habits. Company who offer transportation for example in New York theres a new bike sharing program to reduce car transportation.

So as a fellow citizens its a good idea to cut back and save on money, and pollution to our planet earth. everyone wants a clean and safe enviroment.

9DA4C62BB0F6,"So I'm driving in my nice great black colored Handa with black rims and green neon lights. But let me stop there I do not want to get into all of the details of the car. Like i was saying i was driving and next thing you know BOOM!! I collided with a nasty old rusty out fo style truckand ruine my car. I called 1800-411-pain and they will handle it. I guess i have usage for this car anymore and I can just walk. my point i""m making is that you don't need a car to get you where you go all the time. citizens can use other sources of transportations. Citizens need to take advantages of limting car usage for the u. s. and the world. i'm going to i'm inform citizens about advantages of limiting car usage.

First of all, a lot of citizens love their cars like i did. What some citizens don't know that cars are dangrous. Well I think everybody know that because of all the accidents and crash but I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the pollutions. That the air is being polluted. Secondly, That is not the only thing. Riding bikes, walking, taking the bus, and taking a cab can help stop pollution. Now I'm not talking about taking away all cars. We have to take advantages of limiting the car usage.

Honestly, walking is not that bad and so is riding a bike. It is really good workout. It is also safer than cars if you don't trip or fall off your bike.

Also citizens won't cause congestion. Citizens don't also have pay bill and loans for their cars if you don't have one. Now i know some people have job to get to, so all you have to do is to wake up early for work ride a bike or take the bus arrive to work on time. If you was late and something comes up just make up a lie about why you are. At least you are helping out the world. Most of all, when you drive a car then a cop stops you and give you a ticket even though you didn't do nothing wrong. You can avoid that by just taking a bus. Also going to waste money on gas and the bus only 2 dollars. Like I said I'm saying that you should get rid of your car. i'm saying take advantage of limiting car usage.

In otherwise, in Vauban, Germany life goes on without the usage of cars. As a result, 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. They had to give residents ticket if they drive their. All I'm trying to say is take advantage of limiting car usage.                            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
AABA631FB539,"As a nation wide situation, cars are a main factor of what causes pollution. Limiting car usage helps to make the enviorment we live in better. With the fact of owning a car can be stressful,and the precent rates of car traffic and car purchase has decreased, people have commited to a automoblie free zone.

If in a perseptive of a mother or father, you would prefer for your child to stay inside and not play close to the road because of the slight chance they could be physical hurt by a car. According to Source 1 Heidrum Walter was always tense when owning a car and now living in a city where cars are very limited she is happy. As a citizen in Vauban; where giving up cars is normal, some don't want to. To own a car you must only have the option to park in to places. One is in a large garage at the outskirts of the development and or a house you have to purchase inn order for you to use the parking space. As the limiting of car usage, it would be a lot easier to walk from point A to point B instead of being abnormal and driving further to park. A average amount for a house to citizens that own a automoblie is fourty thousands dollars. It would much cheaper to walk,bike, run, or even skate to a destination.

In Bogota, Colombia it has become a trend to banned cars for one day out of the year. As people enjoy the car free day, they bike, walk, hike or took buses on the rainy day. Rain could not stop the passionate feelings against cars on that day. Many agreed that for just one day the air they walk everyday was different. Not only in Bogota and many other Colombian cities, Paris has joined in on the trend. Many were happy to see no car traffic on the busiest streets in Paris. As before the car banning, the air was horrible and rivaled against the world's most polluted city; Beijing. After the participation of car banning, the smog cleared up enough for the city to continued as before. It has been stated that less people are now involved and well known to a life without a car. People in a range of 16 and 39 dont even bother to get a driver's license because of the droping rates of owning a car. It can be expensive but also dangerous. With limiting car usage people just phone a friend and catch a ride or public transportation. Later on when people have the need fora car, like when having children, working, etc. it will be cheaper and easier to get a car since compaines want you to have one becuase of the lower rates and money not coming in from years before yourself.

Advantages comes with disadvantages as well. Limiting Car Usage comes with a change in enviorment, a better feeling in safety, decreasing in Congestion,and a future that you can see happening for yourself.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
7A1940992606,"There are many advantages of limiting car use. The advantages are less pollution, less stress, and benenifical implications for carbon emissions and the environment. These advantages are good for the earth and they benifit us as a people.

The first advantage is less pollution. If the cars were limited then, there would not be fumes polluting our air. Cars run on gas which produces smoke from the mufler. Then when you drive around, the fumes and smoke comes out of the mufler and goes into the air. Therefore, it pollutes the air. With cars being limited, then we would have a better earth. To be specific, our nature would be better. But there are more advantages then just less pollution.

The second advantage is less stress. You see, in the first article Heidrun Walter says,"" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm so much happier this way."" She was was happy because she sold his car and moved into a car free community. It says also in the first  article that,"" As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"". It says that,"" Vauban completed in 2006,  is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "" smart planning.""

The third advantage is beneficial implicattions for carbon emissions and the environment. In the fourth passage, Michael Sivak says,"" What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household started to come down two to three years before downturn. I think that means more fundamental is going on."" The article says, "" if the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emission.""

Meaning people would not spend more money for gas or anything they will have more money staying in their wallets instead of leaving. They would not car about car insurance or anything because they do not have a car. Also, suburbans are in a new approach of this because now there are stores a walk away.

Also, limiting car usage means less pollution. No more car emissions would be trapped from those cold nights and warm days. There would not be smog also.

Studies show that Americans are becoming less interested in driving.

Instead of driving cars, people often ride their bikes or walk to their destination. By trying to lower car usage, we are promoting exercise.

People feel the need to leave the house less, which is limiting car usage as well. Because of the Internet, communicating is easier and people feel more connected with each other, instead of driving to meet each other.

Paris, for example is banning cars that have an even numbered license plate on Monday. Bogota, Columbia is also banning cars and telling people to find an alternative transportation. Lastly Vauban, Germany is demanding to be ""car-free"".

Paris has had days of near-record pollution, so they had to think of a plan to reduce the pollution in the air. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave thier cars at home of pay a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the crime.

In Bogota, Columbia millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during the car-free day. This day has been going on for 3 years. People faced $25 fine if they violated this event. Citizens were saying that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower the air pollution"". Parks and Sports Centers have been built, old un-even sidewalks have been smoothed out and rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.

In Vauban, Germany residents of this upscale community are giving up their cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experiment of being car-free. Car ownership is allowed but there are only 2 places to park; large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space for 40,000, along with a home. 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move here.

Even though many people still own cars, they still give off bad things for our enviroment. Many cars produce a gas that is bad for the air. Many countries have banned cars on certain days to cut down on air pollution. Paris makes you pay a fine if you are caught driving a car on a certain day. Bogota, Columbia has a specific day that cars are banned and you have to find a different way of transportation. Lastly, Vauban, Germany is demanding to be car-free and have certain ways to have cars but pay for them.

Many of the people in this passage talked a lot about making some of the cities more dense so more people could and would walk to any place they needed to go with out spending a fortune on the way to where it is they need to go. near the bottom of the main passage the writer talks about the ""Enviromental Protection Agency"" discussing this topic as said,""Many experts expect publc transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill"" it is quite obvious that the people spending so many efforts trying to pass this rule really care about the enviroment and all the beings in it.

The second passage talks about Paris banning cars from being driven and ho wharmful it was like, ""After days of near-record pollution, Pars enforced a partial driving bannto clear the air of the global city"".

Beijing China has just been placed in the worst type of economy and climate, because of the, ""cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"". The writer claimed it was the high usage of deisel fuel probably because of the large amount of automobiles with a deisel engine which the writer has accumulated a percent of 67 which is actually pretty high. These high deisel emissions was due to commercialized revanue and mass shippments of various products sold everyday nonstop. this also includes overseas and aircraft shipping which actually does make a difference not only just polluting the air and land but also the water.

Some of the places spoken of use a special event to introduce and promote the idea of not being able to use your automobile for a certain time, but in a few Columbian cities they practically have a festival about it, and some of the people even push the idea and construct walk lanes, smooth sidewalks, restaurants, and shopping districts. Even our own New York City has a ""bike-sharing program"" which helps the enviroment, the city, and maybe even the person, but some of the people who keep their licenses still give off more than we could get in. something that definitly boosts the car emissions is all the new technology that more and more car-makers are coming out with these days. I just beleive it is important that people learn how valuble the Earth is and how little today we respect it as our own home, so my message to all the readers is to mind how often you use your car for little things that can be resolved another sort of way.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D930E883CCBC,"I beam, flashing a smile towards the camera of my mom's iPhone. In my hand, I grip a four-by-three inch square of plastic that, in my perspective, is synonymous with freedom. It's the moment every kid dreams about, lying belly-down on the kitchen floor and pushing a Barbie jeep around their mother's feet as she labors away at the stove, the stark scent of garlic filling their little noses. Finally, I got my driver's license! While definitely a defining moment of adolescence, most teenagers refuse to acknowledge the degrading qualities of driving. Limiting car usage has a multitude of benefits, such as decreasing air pollution and improving the health and quality of life of the world's people.

As a new driver, there is nothing I despise more than waking up to servere smog, squinting as I corral my vehicle down blurred roadways en route to school. By utilizing my own vehicle, however, I am adding to the problem. Smog and other forms of un-aestetic air pollution are caused in part by the greenhouse gas emissions from cars' tailpipes. In the United States, passenger cars are responsible for up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. (Source 1) Another large percentage of these emissions comes from the unefficient, energy-wasting, carbon-spewing processes required to create gasoline and diesel fuel. Essentially, we emit large amounts of greehouse gases to produce fuel for our vehicles which, in turn, release more greenhouse gases. As an AP Environmental Science student, I know better than anyone the degrading results of excessive greenhouse gases. As these particles accumulate in the atmosphere, light from the sun, including harmful ultraviolet rays, stays trapped in our planet, causing a gradual rise in average temperature. This process is known as global warming. Besides being dangerous to our planet, air pollution is unappealing visualy to all inhabitants of Earth. Smog once reached such high levels in Paris, the capital of France, that a partial driving ban was placed on the city to purify the air. After one day of diminishing the number of cars on the roads by 50%, the smog had cleared enough for civilians to continue their daily activities. (Source 2) The grotesque images associated with smog can harm Paris' economy; tourists want to view the Palace of Versailles with a tear in their eye from its beauty, not from the sting of air pollutants.

Limiting car usage also has a variety of physical and psycological benefits that improve the health of earth's people. For example, a suburban community in Germany, known as Vauban, has gone completely car-free. 57% of Vauban's residents sold a car to move in and, so far, the majority of them seem to be enjoying the benefits. Heidrun Walker, a media trainer and mother of two, is one of them. ""When I had a car, I was always tense,"" she said, ""I'm much happier this way."" (Source 1) Walker's statement shows the improved psychological well-being of those who do not rely on cars for the majority of their transportation. Decreased reliance on motor vehicles can also improve the physical health of humanity. Without personalized vehicles for transportation, many people will walk, jog, bike, or skate to their various destinations. Such a phenomenon occurs annually in Bogota, the capital of Columbia. Every year, they host a ""Day Without Cars"", during which Columbians rely on their own two feet to move about their sprawling city. (Source 3) Physical activities such as walking have a variety of benefits, including increased cardiovascular health. If more countries hosted events similar to Bogota's ""Day Without Cars"", emergency rooms may find they have less clogged arteries to deal with.

Limiting car usage has many pros, including decreased air pollution and increased mental and physical well-being of the world's people. The next time you unlock your car to drive two minutes to your friend's house, stop and consider the consequences of your actions. Consider the health of yourself and your planet, and try walking instead.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

If we want the earth to live as long as possible, if we want a safe enviroment for our children to live in the future, then we need change.

There is a settlement in Europe called Vauban, it is a car-free community, for the most part. There is only a couple streets in the entire community that are hospitable to cars. None of the houses except for a few have garages. 70 percent of the population does not own a car. It is a trending lifestyle in Europe, and i can see why. 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions are from cars in Europe. That number is raised to 50 percent in some parts of the United States.

In Paris, it was so smoggy that they had to ban the use of vehicles for an entire weekend, one day even license plates would be banned, the next day odd. If you were caught driving with a banned license plate you would be fined, and approximately 4,000 people were fined on that weekend, 27 people's cars were impounded. This was all part of an attempt to clear the 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter that was congesting the air. Compared to London with 79.7. Public transit however was free during this time, and hybrid cars, electric cars, and cars with 3 or more passengers were allowed.

In Bogota, Colombia, they celebrate ""Car-free day"", where everyone in the city leaves their cars at home and either hikes, bikes, skates, or takes the bus to work and school. Violators face a $25 fine. It all started back in the mid 1990s, the city has added 118 miles of bicycle paths since then, the most out of any latin city. Parks and sports centers have also made an appearance around the city.

Basically what im trying to get across here is that all cars do is make us get to work faster, but if you think about the cons, it pollutes our earth, it dirties our streets, it congests our cities, and it makes everyone unhappy. We need to change, not all of us, but some of us, for the children.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
9C1450552F50,"Most people think that limiting car usaging is bad, but it's actually good for the environment. In Paris, they were day's of near record pollution and has more smog then other European capitals, so they desided to ban driving to clear the air. It was successful and the smog cleared.

In Bogota, Colombia, the Colombians have a day where they are not allowed to drive. The main goal is to reduce polluton and to promote alternative transportation. In a way, it is good that the Columbians have a car free day, but when a person has to visit somebody or go to work in another city, then its gonna get difficult to go to their destination. Even though Buses and taxis can be used for transportation, citizens have to spend more money then what they usually spend when they use their own car, or if they have to use a bike to make it to there destination, it will lead them to exhaustion and will take longer to get where they need to be.

In the United States, it was said that Americans are buying fewer cars since 2005. Between the years 2001 to 2009, the percentage of young people driving decreased 23 percent. At New York, they have a bike sharing program and has increased on tunnel and bridge tolls that reflected those new priorities. Honestly, this is actually great what this country is doing. The reason for that is because with fewer drivers and the percntage of fewer drivers, it will also reduce the percentage of car crashes and reduce the amount of pollution. With the bike sharing program that they have in New York, it also help people have a better lifestyle.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

We find different ways to get to school and work without a car. This is good for our planet and i'm sure mother Earth is thanking us for it, but in ten years from now will people even know what a car is?

Cars can play a big role in someone's life, it even has the power to take it away. In Bogota, Columbia a car-free day took place and buinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said, ""It's a great opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Driving is something that takes years of practice to perfect and it should not be taken lightly. How much a state pays in repairs in damages caused by car accidents must be huge! So what would happen if no one drove anymore? What it be a change for good?

Less and less people are driving today as our world is changing. Accroding to Doug Short, the amount of miles driven by a person has dropped 9 percent. Many people find it more difficult to own a car and fill it with gas and have to drive somwhere. They would much rather live in a place where they can just walk to work. The use of a very advanced internet is a good way to keep in touch with friends without having to get off your couch!

Cars have a really big effect on the air pollution and it is really starting to hurt our Earth. Paris has recently had a near-record pollution. Paris had 147 of micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter! This goes for show what kind of effect a car's exhaust can do. By people resiting the need to drive anywhere and even owning a car, it is going to help with controlling the smog prdocued and hopefully help keep our Earth alive!

So overall by limiting car use and by people taking the bus or riding their bike, our Earth can remain healthy. Also by limting the use of cars we can use those costs and apply it somewhere more useful and possibly save lives! Of course cars can be good, but their bad seems to cancel out what little good they do indeed. Our world we live in is changing and people are straying away from cars. In ten to twenty years who will even know what a car is?    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
360B5117F715,"Taking a deep breath in a city filled with cars and buses, people would be inhaling all the emissions giving off by the heavy duty use of cars. Taking in smog is like breathing in dirt. Changes around the world are taking place to accomodate to the impacts caused by cars. In the twenty-first cenury, cars are a must to get from place to place. So, why is it that there is a decline in the buying of cars? Well, the less usage of cars creates no smog to inhale, would promote alternative transportation, and the culture in this society helps create less dependence on cars which leds to a better envrionment.

First things first, around the world something known as ""smart planning"" is taking place. This is a movement to seperate suburban life from auto use. One main reason this movement is taking place is to reduce emissions giving off by automobiles, that would soon lead to smog. According to

Source 2:

""Paris ban driving due to smog,""  by Robert Duffer,  which states,"" After days of near-record polluton, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This ban was necessary due to the over pollution cars create and because of it, air was able to become breathable again.  Moreover, in

Source 3:

"" Care-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky, Bogota tells the goal behind the car-free day, which states, ""The goal is to promote alternative transportaion and reduce smog."" Clearly, having a bus filled with residents is a better choice than having cars filled only by one or two passengers because one bus would not produce as much emissions than twenty cars.

Futhermore, the less dependence of cars would promote alternative transportation. Having a city filled with people walking, riding bikes, and taking buses would allow a traffic free city. In Europe, cities are taking the step forward by creating a city where it is difficult to obtain a car. According to

Source 1:

""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, explains the main motive why cities are making it difficlt to use cars, which is, ""Its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accesible to public transprtation, with less space for parking."" This means, that by making it a struggle to obtain a car, it would help promote others to use public transportation or another method, which at the end of the day, would benefit the environment.

Last but not least, the culture of the world is constanly changing day by day. In the twenty-first century, technology has taken over the lives of many. From apps to the internet, the changes are inevitable thanks to the breakthrough in technology.  In

Source 4:

""The End of Car Culture,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University, explains,""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift."" Mimi is talking about the recent decline of automobile sales occuring which mean less and less people are buying cars. She believes the reason behind the decline is due to the culture in which involves technology. Moreover, she goes on to say,"" Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" Again and again technology proves to be a saving factor in this world to humans, and in this case it is saving humans from injurying the only home it has. With the easy access of calling someone up for a ride or searching up public transportation near by, allows the environment to be fresher and cleaner, as well as, it allows humans to interact with one another without having to drive to that person's house.

Movements take place to improve what seems to be a problem. It is obvious that the over usage of cars is a problematic case. Around the world, people are going around side by side, without depending on cars like they use to back a couple years ago. Improvements shown in places like Paris, shows how the limiting of automobile usage can greatly impact the envrionment to create a clean atmosphere. Not only would it help clear smog, but it would allow a stress free city from being populated by traffic jams and yelling individuals, who are experiencing road rage thanks to the taffic. A happier environment would be created when people are out rding bikes to places and walking with friends. In cocnclusion, the benifits of limiting car usage are as clear as water, it would reduce smog, promote other forms of transprtation, and would help our culture by creating a happier, cleaner atmosphere to live in.

03904638A08A,"Now and days, our world has transformed from using simple transportation to one source: the automobile. However, recent studies have shown our slow progression for the past years, discovering other ways of getting to point A to point B by having programs, reducing pollution and smog along the way, and living in an affordable economy.

To begin with, cities in our world have proven to be ""car-free cities"" by allowing programs to show other ways of transportation and reducing pollution and smog along the way. In Bogota, Colombia, a program where it is ""a car free day"", millions of Colombian's hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work and as Enrique Riera mentions in source 3, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution (paragraph 24)"". Colombia has been hosting this program since the 1990's and it has spread around the world; the influence Colombia has done is beyond incredible. Although the program is not held everyday, it impacts the world slowly. Also, in source 2, the usage of car in France has decreased drastically because of the ""intensifying smog (paragraph 14)"". Because their tax policy ""favors diesal over gasoline (paragraph 16)"", they're required to use diesal, but the French decide to rebel to save the enviroment, in result causing delivery companies to complain. Although, because the French did use less cars it made the smog clear up. In all, programs such as the one held in Colombia influence all arts of the world with showing other ways of transportation and even saving the enviroment.

In addition, the world continues to reduce the use of cars because it becomes more affordable to the people. When the economy crashed in the United State's, people relied on their cars, until they realized it was too expensive to pay gas, pay parking, but needed an alternative and as it says in source 4, ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit...(paragraph 36)"". People do not want to go back to a car based economy. They're finding other affordable sources. Not only does the usage of cars affect people financially, but also emotionally. In Vauban, Germany, as a result of forbidding street parking, house garages and fee's, 70 percent of the famalies do not own cars and Heidrun Walter, a mother of two, who usually bikes, expesses herself about the situation in source 1, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"". Clearly, the use of less cars result in a finacial plus and an emotional change as well.

In conclusion, ""car free days"" are much more effective in a way that demonstrates the world other options of transportation, an opportunity to save the enoviroment, and an affordable economy to all.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

More money in our pockets means buying more items that are useful to us. And muse about how much pollution would decrease! We could all breathe in sublime air, clean air! Instead of huge car garages and parking lots we could save a lot of room, and use that room to build cheap houses for people in need.

Gas prices are hefty these days. They used to be a whopping 5 cents! Now they are around 2.90$ almost three dollars! Could you even imagine how much money you would save a month? If you pay for 5 gallons of gas everyweek you would be saving around 60$ a month! You could go out, buy extra groceries, have fun with it! I remember back in 2014 gasoline prices waged to 5$ in some counties. Me and my father had to walk to our favorite stores, but it turns out that we very well like the sun beating on our skin, so we usually walk, and we rarely use our car unless we travel far distances.

Pollution will always be a big problem on Earth. We may not have cars, but we still have ships, and guess what? They can cause pollution, too!

Driving in this generation can be fun, but can also cause a lot of disadvantages. Cars can be very dangerous and cause a lot of damage in this world.

Limiting how much we use the car would have a huge positive effect on the enviroment. It would make the air more breathable, pure, and reduce the amount of smog in the air.

With the change in the economy, gas prices are up and down, and it's stressful trying to fill up your car having to spend so much money, when you have a family to take care of. Alot of people struggle with things like this situation, including bills. It wouldnt hurt to walk, or to take the bus to work. If you actually think about all the money you spend, using a car, you would realize that you could save much money by not having one. Maybe one day your car could start acting up and you would have to take it to the shop. Just imagine how much it would cost to fix it.

Cities have come to the realization of how much pollution is being released into our air by motor vehicles. Many cities and countries are taking part in this attempt to clear the air, such as: Germany, Paris, Columbia, and the United States. Smog is hanging over many cities in a dull cloud, blocking the citizens' lungs from receiving clean air but cities are starting to come to an understanding of how dirty our world is becoming.

In a small town with the population of 5,500, Vauban, Germany, the streets are completely ""car-free"", which does not include public transportation and certain roads meant for driving. If one wishes to own a car, they must purchase a car space with their home, costing a whopping $40,000.(source:1;paragraph:2) This automatically discourages home-owners to purchase a car because of the steep price. The attempt to rid the air of pollution is gradually becoming more and more successful. 70 percent of Vauban families do not own any motor vehicles, and 57 percent sold their cars to move to the small town. The United States Environmental Protection Agency approves of this movement and is promoting car reduced communities. Although this is occurs in the suburbs, it is hoped to spread into the cities as well. (source:1;paragraph:9)

Paris came to the smart decision of a driving ban once their air was replaced with a filthy smog. All motorists that owned license plates with even-numbers were required to leave their cars at home for the day, or they would be fined. The same rule would apply to any motorists with odd-numbered plates the next day. Evidently, it did not seem as if the people cared about the wellness of their planet, since 4,000 drivers were fined in a single day. 27 people were so furious with this law, their reactions cause them all to have their cars impounded.(source:2;paragraph:10-12) The pollution was catastrophic enough to have Paris challenging China for the record of the most polluted city in the world. After one day of a car-less city, the smog cleared enough to revoke the ban for odd-numbered plates the next day.

In an attempt for world-wide change, Bogota, Columbia creates a ""Day Without Cars"" in the capital city holding 7 million inhabitants. Many citizens partook in this act. They hoped to promote alternative transportation such as buses, biking, skating, hiking and walking to reduce pollution and have fresh air to breathe. Any violators were to be fined a fee of $25. (source:3;paragraph:20-21) This campaign began in the 1990s and has resulted in the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which is the highest amount of alternative transportation in any Latin American city, according to the city mayor. (source:3;paragraph:27) Bogota has seemed to make the highest impact of cleaning out air pollution, and resulted in a more positive effect on every person's life.

The motivation of people trying to clean up the human act of pollution and waste is abundant and consistent throughout the entire world. We are changing the daily enjoyment of our lives, animals lives, and the cleaness of the earth one step at a time.

73264E2E4ED2,"There was a world before cars. One without polluted air, green house gasses, and holes in the O-ZONE layer. Transportation was done the old fashioned way, with your two legs. Aside from your legs, we now have other methods of transportation aside from legs and motor vehicles, such as bikes. Technology is on the rise.. But are cars on their way down?

A new trend is starting, and like all good trends they have hefty price tag. An excerpt from ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" written by Elisabeth Rosenthal in the

New York Times . In paragraph two it gives an example of the expensive lifestyle to live if you would choose to live with a car, ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park--large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" Not going green comes with a price tag. Residents of this new community are pleased with the cut down on motor vehicles. Less stress, less pollution. According to the text in paragraph five ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe."" 12% may not seem like much, but if you look at the big picture, its quite the amount.

Another issue that is caused by motor vehicles is smog. Smog is what happens when there is fog and a mixure of gasses created by the exhaust in a motor vehicle. Pollution in Paris is at its all time high. In an article from the

Chicago Tribune by Robert Duffer, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" in paragraph eleven says, ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars ar home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to the odd-numbered plates the following day."" This ban gives people the opportunity to cut back on fuel by car pooling, taking public transportation, or riding a bike. Many drivers did not cooperate and approximately 4,000 drivers were fined. Consistency is key, will Paris continue the cut back?

Around the world officials are working to cut back. Bogota, Colombia has the car free program which bans all but busses and taxi's and leaving anyone who doesnt obey to pay a 25$ fine. In an excerpt from ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky written in the

Seattle Times paragraph twent two says, ""The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota."" This shows although there is bad weather people are still set on reducing motor vehicle transportation and decreasing smog. Along with the reduction of car usage Bogota is encouraging sports and outdoor play. Sidewalks have been enlarged and smoothed with leaves way for walkers and bikers. Parks have opened up as well as sports centers.

Are use of motor vehicles really decreasing? In an excerpt from, ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal from the

New York Times in paragraph 41 shows evidence, ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...."" Car culture is ending, and going green has just begun. Around the world from Paris, to Bogota, to the United States we are all cutting back on motor vehicle use. This will be a project that takes many years to finish but with the team work of the world, most definately anything can happen.                                  ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Many residents here feel that having no cars gives them a little peace of mind. Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" A major up-side to not owning a car is the relief from stress. Many people have many worries about their cars; whether it will work, the amount of gas in it, the cost of gas, and so on. Getting rid of the problem also gets rid of the worry. Getting rid of cars also allows new opportunities for better city building. Makeing cities and suburbs denser discourages the need for cars and promotes the idea of walking, biking, or skating to a destination.

The United States has always loved its cars, but recently many people have taken to the side-walks instead of taking to the streets. Transportation is the second largest source of emissions in America and it seems to be declining. Studyies find that after 2005, many Americans began to stop buysing cars and started to find other ways to go from point A to point B.  Many people credit this fact to the recession around 2008. After the down turn, people became more money contious, and the unemployed didn't need to go anywhere anyway. With no cars, Americans can save thousands of dollars a year because of no payments and not having to pay those expensive gas prices! The fewer cars on the street has also had a postivie impact on the enviornment. Less greenhouse gases has made the air in the suburbs and some cities much cleaner. Technology has also made a huge impact on our commute. People connected with friends and family without even having to drive and visit them, and teleconfernces across countries and continents have reduced the need to drive or fly places to do buisness. Many mojor car producig companies have also rebranded themselves in order to make personal transportation a thing of the past and make mass public transportation a obtainable goal.

Smog is a big issue, not only in the United States, but also in places such as Erope and Latin America, both of which have started to make efforts on cleaning the air and redcing the amount of cars on the road. In the 1990's Bogota, Colombia started a tradition in which the citizens find alternative ways of trasportation to work and shops one day out of the year, and for three straight years, cars have been banned in the streets on this ""holiday."" Because this event has grown so poular, many people have started to practice life without cars on a daily basis. New parks have formed, hundreds of biking paths have been added throughout the city, and upscale resturants and stores have began to pop up in the city. The car-free lifestyle has definitely effected Bogota, Colombia. Europe has also had a great quarrel with its smog problem in recent years, and Frane has been making an effort to stop the smog problem from getting any bigger. Paris recently put a ban on driving in the city in effort to reduce smog. On Monday, divers with even license plates were asked to find other ways of transportation, and on Tuesday drivers with odd license plates could not drive. The population did not have a very positive reaction, but the congestion of cars in the capital did go down sixty percent on both days, and the efforts worked so well, the city was able to lift the ban after on week.

Car culture has been a part of our societ for a long time. However, large strides have been made all across the globe in order to reduce the amount of cars on the road and the amount of pollution in the air. These strides have had many positive impacts on the communities they have served in and continute to make tomorrow a better and cleaner world.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
3FC5239BAD99,"What are the advantages of limiting car use? Eventhough cars are a really fast way to get from one place to another there are many other ways for example a train,air plane or boat. There are too many cars on the streets and many crazy drivers. People should stop using cars because cars make greenhouse gas and it's causing the air to be polited. Another advantage for limiting car use is that less people are going to be geting killed because of car axcidents or because of drunck drivers. Also if people stoped driving cars aand tok there bike to work or were ever they go more people would be in shape becuase they would be doing some excersice too.

Too many cars on the steets are poluting the air and thats not good for us because we are cutting down trees and we are going to run out of air to breath at some point if we continue like this. Thats why poeple should stop driving cars and ride a bike to there job or take the train. Also cars make geenhouse gas, cars are responsible for 12 persent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states. We are also going to have less death because many people die in car axcidents and becuase of drunk drivers and less kids are going to be getting hurt or killed if there on the street because they dont have to worry about cars hitting them. For example if a kid is playing with a ball and the ball goes to the street the kid is probably going to go get it but he wont get hurt because there are no cars on the streets.

Eventhough cars cause greenhouse gas, air polution and death they are also very help full because if you have to go late at night to get food you have a fast way to get to the market because u have a car right out side your door. Also if something happens to your son in school or if u or someone needs medical attention you have a fast way to take them to the hospital or to get to were they are. But theres a down side if you go out to see what happend to you son in a hurry you probably going to have a car axcident and get seriously hurt or worst. Too many people use too many cars the streets are always crouded with cars at all times and some of these people drive crazy or they try to show of there car by going fast and end up getting killed or killing someone els.

This are some of the advantages of limiting car use less people would die,we would have more air to breath, and there would be less green house gas effect. And i think think that it is a good idea to stop using cars and take your bike to work because you would be helping earth and will be getting some exersice at the same time. And you would also be helping to to save earth and have a better future for you kids. Well this is what i think but what do u think?    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

They might have just gotten taken in as if the were to go and drive or even walk with them for as long as possnle. Then there are the way some of them that are driving a certain car for a time being until they were able to help the enviornment that is neer by. Then in the second passage it is saying that people will try to use there cars less so that the smog will go fading little by little or is it going to start to disapate. I must say that it might take a while until they might have made it at the time they could have done it so they might even try to create a day when no one will be using a car so they might get a better life and they might be able to pervent smog also and they might get to a part of the atmoshere and depleat the ozone layer making the sun even harsher for us.

This acounts for a healthier life style. There is also less risk of injury. Limiting car use can be very effective in making a better tomorrow.

According to source 2 Paris bans driving due to smog and polution that vehicals make. This mostly accounts to the desile fueled cars as well as the older models with less eco friendly motors. By banning cars they were able to cut their polution hate to an all time low for Paris. Maybe this choice to ban and limit car use was a good idea for the people of Paris.

There is a car free day in Bogota where their main focus is to reduce smog as well as promote alternative transportation. This has proven to be affective. They have been doing this car free day for three consecative years now. Violaters of the car free day face 25 dollar fines. I think this is an great idea in order to preseve out planet.

The vast limiting of car use is becoming whats known as ""The End of Car Culture."" Americans are becoming less and less concerned with getting licenses and becoming more addaptive to alternative trasportation. This is a great coincadense in terms of preventing polution.

In Paris, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. In BOGOTA, Columbia millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during car free day. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, If cautiously.

In VAUBAN, Germany 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. As you walk Verdant streets where you can here the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drowning out the occasional distant of motors.

In Paris, diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 dollar fine. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined.

In BOGOTA, Columbia there goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced a 25 dollar fine. Being car free is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.  Parks and sport centers blooming, no traffic just people and there everyday life.

The United States is the birthplace of the Model T,the home of Detroit, the place where Wilson Pickett immortilized ""Mustang Sally."" Presidents Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States green house gas emission is slowly working. The number of miles driven per person is nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. New York's new bike sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car sharing programs across the nation.

In conclusion, life without cars keeps life fresh. Cars are destroying the earth from smog. We will be much happier people with out cars. Having to see all the children and all the wonderful people actually having a good time with there families. Cars are every where but if we can reduce the amount of cars being driven maybe we can save the earth from air pollution.                       ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Data has been shown that the driving in America has decreased over the years and study shows that the driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. My response to this would be that all of this, is that people are trying to help and make for something better

Getting around without cars isnt just happening with small time people, Countrys are even getting involed. for example Paris, after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a patial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. motorists in paris with numbered license are told to leave there cars at home, if not they would have to suffer a 22-euro fine. this is a great way to allow less pollution go into the atomshere, this also helps everyone even if they dont know it. And not just paris has a car-free day, but Bogota , Colmbia use this as well. many colombians hiked , biked, skated or took busss to work during a car-free day. this helps our planet so much even if its a small thing it help little by little.

Many countrys do a great thing by doing this and it helps and even if the trip from A to B might take a little longer, its worth it. usage of cars being less used is a very important thing people do .            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

5F7E9F042E8C,"In countries such as America, Germany and Europe air pollution is high and one of the main reasons of that is fuel coming from a truck or car. Cities such as  Vauban, Paris and Bogato realize that their atmosphere is full of pollyion and have decided to make a changer of that. Although people may not give up their car for a long periiod of time, even just a day makes a huge impact on their atmosphere.

In hte citie of Vauban, Germany you will not hear the loud sound of a car engine very often. This citie is very unique and residents of this upscale community are what we call pioneers. Street Parking, driveways, and garages are forbidden in the community of Frieburg. The streets of Vauban are ""car free""  except for the main thoroughfair where you can catch the tram to downtown Freiburg and a couple streets on the edge of the community. If you are to own a car their are two places to park, large car garages at the edgeat the edge of a development which wil cost you 40,000$ to own a spot. 70% of Vaubans families do not own a cars, and 57% sold a car to move here.

In Paris, France they nearly faced a record pollution due to excess driving on several days. To put a stop to it the city enforced a rule that on mondays even-numbered cars were permitted to not use their vehicle and on tuesdays odd-numbered cars were too not use their vehicle. If the people did not listen and use their cars on that day they were given a fine of 22-euro (31$). Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five days of the idea of non-vehicle use.

Another city that believed in non-vehicle use is Bogato, Colombia. On this certain day, Colombians used their bike, skatebaored, walked or took busses to get to work. This left the streets of the capital city clear of all cars except for buuses or taxis. This has been the third straight year that cars have been banned in a citie with 7 million people. The goal of this trend is to promote alternative transportation and to reduce secrete pollution in the air. Along with less air pollution parks and sportes centers also have bloomed throught the city; eneven sidewalks have been replaced with  more broad, thicker sidewalks; rush-hour resrtictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resturaunts and shoppings districs have cropped up.

These particular cities have seen dramatic changes due to their no car use belief. One day a week of no vehicles can make a change on not just your city but on yourself also. If every city folowed along with these cities we would find ouselves in great shape when it comes to pollution in our atmosphere.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
06BFA3A7DF52,"I think the limiting for car usage is not right because if people want to drive they should be able to. Walking, and riding bicycles aren't fun you get tired really easy and have to stop but when you are in a car you don't get tired and you don't have to stop you just keep driving.

Driving a car is easier because when you are late for work or getting somewhere you can get there faster. If you are walking or riding a bike your not going to get there on time a car is faster and quicker to get to places without any trouble. Gas could be high but it is worth it because a lady with three kids could be rushing trying not to be late for work and trying to get her kids ready for school so instead of walking them to school or riding bikes she could just drive them to school and not be late for work. Driving a car is so much easier and quicker.

Traffic with cars is bad but when you need to get places you can drive a car instead of taking the bus that has to stop ten different places. Cars are being banned in Columbia and you can only ride buses or taxis. Taxis can get you where you need to just as fast as your own car can but a bus couldn't because there is always people in front of you that have to get off in different places. They made two seated bikes just for this man and his wife to get around because they didn't want them driving there cars.

Teenagers get there license at a young age now and they start driving. They drive to school and to practices and everywhere else but it could be dangerous because some teenagers just like to goof and round and try to act all bad and then end up hurting them self and somebody else and it would be their fault. Some teens just decide not to get them because it is safe just to ride with their parents instead of them driving and having the chance to get in a wreck and hurt their self and then there car be ruined and won't be able to get a new one. Most teens love to drive because it's fun and they like getting out on there own. Teens like to go out and hang with there friends or go get something to eat. Other people are more worried about there job and social life then trying to get a car so they can drive all the time.

In conclusion, a limiting on car usage should be that they shouldn't have a limiting on car usage because most people are late for stuff when they don't drive there car. Walking and driving a car is way different a car is way faster then walking and trying to get to places on time. That is my opinion on limiting to car usage.                        ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
59CF05D9EDF8,"Limiting car usage can be beneficial in many ways. For example, the air would be a lot less poluted if we reduced the amount of cars being used. In a German suburb that rarely ever uses cars, people report that it is less stressful to not own a car.

The advantages of limiting car usage is not only beneficial to people but also to the planet. If people were to limit their car suage, the amount of polution and smog in the air would be reduced and not be such an issue (Paris bans driving due to smog, P19).

Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog (Paris bans drving due to smog, P14).

""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drving ban to clear the air of the glabal city."" (Paris bans driving due to smog, P10). Regardless of the partial driving ban, almost 4,000 drivers were fined. This shows that some people do not really care about all the pollution they are bringing the Earth. Which gives people more reason not to limit car usage. If people are not going to try limiting down  the usage, other poeple will follow that and not do so either. So limiting car usage is really important for the planet and for us.

The less cars we use the less smog there will be in the air.

Trying to limit car usage is not a new thing, the day without car is part of an improvement campaing that began in Bogota, Colombia in the mid 1990s (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, P27). In Colombia, the rain did not stop the people from participating in the car-free day, and it had an effect in two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, which joined in the car-free day for the first time (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, P25). So the car free day is rapidly making its way into cities, so that it can help limit the amount of cars being used.

Limiting car usage is very benefitial because it will also help keeping young people safe.

Researcher have found that drving between young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 (The end of car culture, P41). ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn"" (The end of car culture, P33). ""If the pattern persisits... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportaion is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" (The end of culture, P34). If the usage of cars is reduced, people could be a lot happier than the are now. Since 2001, resarchers believe that young people do not make getting their licenses a priority anymore, which does improve the fact that people are getting a step closer to helping reduce the amount carbon in the air. If people could organize their schedual around being able to walk or take public transportation to the location they need to be at, there would be no need to use cars, to an extent of course. Not everyone can there their schedual to do that, but the more people that contribute to it the better.

""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" says Heidrun Walter (Car free cities, P3). Limiting the amount of car usage will not only help to reduce the amount of carbon in the air, but it could also help the people live a happier life like Heidrun Walter. Although not everyone feels that way, whether people like it or not, it is better for them to reduce car usage not only for their sake but also for the worlds sake.

If car usage was to be limited, not only would the world be rid of more carbon, but it could also have a great impact on peoples lives.

""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commertial and public transporation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety"""" (The end of car culture, P43).

Also earth is are home. Why would should we all sit back and see are selfs destroy everything we bulit. The more cars we have and use the more damage we do on the earth. Cars have a huge part in the earths greenhouse gas. In Europe greenhouse emissions are up to 12%. In the United states greenhouse gas emissions are up to a bone crushing 50%.

Source 2 - Due to all the greenhouse gas after almost record breaking pollution, Paris had to do something about the smog. They set a law that only even numbered license plates were allowed to leave there home on mondays and odd numbered on the next day. That may have lead to some problems such as late to work...ect. But after five days the smog was down 60%.

The future is going to be a place where we can't even breathe in air without having a mask on our heads due to smog. Going green as in limiting cars is a tremendous idea for the communites, and for the planet for various reasons. No smog in the atmosphere, greener communites, and more benefical ways of transportaion. Once you go green you will go never back.

To start off, Smog is one of the main disadvantages of owning or being in heavily populated area where they use cars frequently. Smog is when the cars emit there gases out of there tailpipe, and get traped in the atmosphere causing people to have problems breathing. Articles in the city of Paris in France said that they had to ban cars due to the smog in the atmosphere. They hit a near record of air pollution and stopped people form using there cars on certian days to clear the smog from the atmosphere. On that five day period of the intensifying smog actually rivaled the place of Beijing, China which is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Once the smog cleared they rescind the ban of car usage only to be a the same place there are going to be now if they keep on using cars.

In addition, cities around the world are creating new communities where they are not allowed to use cars. In Vauban, Germany the residents there are in a set up where they cannot use cars in there everyday life. 70 percent of the people over there do not own a car and 57 percent sold their car just to move into the community. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrum Walter, a resident of the city. Other places in the world like in Bogota, Colombia is in a program that they cannot use cars in there life. The life were they are no cars is a good life for a community and for everyone else.

Lastly, the end of transportion is not done, but people are finding new ways of transportation. Newer ways of transportation has stared in New York they have a bike-sharing program has skyrocketed. As well as car pooling since only one car or van is being used rather than 4 of 5 cars it is more efficient. People in the United states are using these ideas in there everyday life. Sutdies have shown that are less likely to get their drivers liscense and get a car. The world will be in a better place without car usage.

To summerize, limiting car usage is a extrodinary idea to make the world a better place. To cease the air pollution of smog, to make greener communities, and to make efficent ways of transportation.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A68849B8E3B6,"Ever since their creation, cars have been the main method of transportation. However, in recent times cars have become less popular because of the issues that they cause. Limited car use would be very advantageous because vehicles discourage physical activity, make pollution, and cost everyone money.

An advantage of limiting the use of cars is that they discourage physical activity. Reliance on a motorized vehicle for transportation from place to place results in little to no physical activity. Cars have replaced the use of bicycles, skateboards, and regular walking, their use seemingly reserved only for the youth. In a car free society such as Vaunban, Germany, the ""swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children"" can be heard by anyone walking down the street (Source 1). This clearly shows that when cars are used less,  people engage in more physical activity. This is the same case for Bogota, Columbia where the Day Without Cars is a big hit. Just in the third year of this event, over 118 miles of bicycle paths have been contructed in the city (Source 3). Limiting the use of cars is definetely advantageous because they discourage physical acticity.

Limiting the use of cars would be incredibly beneficial because they make polluation. The billions of vehicles in the world create unbelievable amounts of pollution. In Europe, ""passenger cars are respondible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions"" and ""up to 50 percent... in the United States"" (Source 1). The pollution from the increasing amounts of cars in compacted areas ""are chocking cities"" (Source 1). Nearly nothing else creates that much pollution. The only thing that cars are second to in the polluation rates are the monstrous power plants that continuously belch smoke into the atmosphere (Source 4). If the use of vehicles decreases, then ""it will have beneficial impliciarions for carbon emissions and the environment"" (Source 4). This evidence clearly supports that the use of vehicles is causing a huge amount of pollution. Thus, limiting the use of cars would be incredibly beneficial because they make pollution.

Decreased use of automobiles would be extremely advantageous because the they cost everyone money. Expenses such as constant maintanance and fuel cost the average car owner a large chunk of their salary. In April 2013, the average miles driven per person was down by 9 percent, equivalent to the rate in January 1995 (Source 4). The most likely cause is that ""cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars"" (Source 4). The high cost of cars and their maintanace is a huge burden on the backs of the average vehicle owner. Not only does vehicles cost the individual person, but they have large effects on the government. In the six-year federal transportation bill, the cost of the highways was 80 percent, and only 20 percent was available to all other forms of transportation (Source 1). This issue has caused the legislators to get involved with the problem. Obviously, decreasing the amount of automobiles would be extremely advantageous because they cost everyone money.

The decrease of drivers can be attributed to several events, one such event being the large quantity of greenhouse gas emissions caused by vehicles, especially cars. With society shifting to become less car centered, communities are adjusting accordingly, becoming more compressed to enable walking to ones workplace or a store. Additionally, the lowered use of cars results in a greater usage of more physical methods of transit, such as riding a bike or skating to a destination while saving the money that would have been spent on maintaining a car.

Pollution is an important issue on a global scale, having the potential to drastically impact the lives of both humans and other life forms. A large amount of pollution brings negative health effects upon most living creatures, making it essential to reduce pollution levels for the betterment of the environment. Some may think that cars don't have a large influence on pollution, but ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States,"" (Rosenthal Paragraph 5). Automobiles are responsible for a large portion of greenhouse gasses, as ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants,"" (Rosenthal Paragraph 34). The enormous amount of pollution in some areas of the world even resulted in temporary bans of personal vehicles to reduce the smog, and at one point ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,"" (Duffer Paragraph 10). As a result of this temporary ban in the previously smog filled city of Paris, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France,"" (Duffer paragraph 14).

In order for society to shift away from the use of personal vehicles, distances between destinations must be reduced. There are experimental communities to test the effects of more compact cities, the most drastic being a Vauban, Germany, a suburb without cars. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life,"" (Rosenthal paragraph 6). These compacted cities have homes and stores placed close to one another, eliminating the necessity for a car or other vehicle. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway,"" (Rosenthal paragraph 6). Life within a smaller community saves the residents a lot of time which would have otherwise been spent on lengthy commutes. Additionally, through living in a less spread out society, people are more connected to one another, better learning their neighbors who are closer, while developing a deeper feeling of a community, by living in a close-knit zone. This reduction or even elimination of personal vehicle usage would enable more funds to be put toward public transport or pavement, as opposed to the current setup where ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport,"" (Rosenthal paragraph 9).

Not only does the reduction of car use have environmental, time, and societal benefits, but there are also health as well as economic benefits to be wrought from avoiding car use. When not using a personal vehicle for transportation, other methods must be applied to reach a destination. Among these methods there are choices of public transportation, riding a bike, hiking, skating, and more. By not taking a vehicle and instead commuting by foot or bike, the commuters health improves as a result of the exercise. Many claim that traveling by other methods than a car reduces stress, one such testamony coming from businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza: ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,'"" (Selsky paragraph 24).

In addition to health benefits, there are also economic benefits, as there is no need to maintain a car when one is not in use.

In conclusion, there are various benefits to not using a car. These benefits range from improving the condition of the environment thorugh reducing pollution, as well as saving money for those not                                                    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E11992CA707D,"Many people today are accepting the idea of limiting car usage around the world. Though cars are an excellent way to get around they might not be the best for the enviorment. In a city in Germany, Vauban is home to many residents who do not own a car. In fact 70% do not have one and 57% sold a car to move there. These people aren't only seeing an environmental effect but also they seem more happy.

Pollution is also a problem when it comes to motor veichles. When Paris had a record day of pollution they decided to take action and inforced a partial driving ban. In just five days, congestion in France was down 60%. As you can see limiting car usage is already benefitting many and the more we turn to it the most likely we are to be living a more happy and safer life.

In places such as Bogota, Colombia there are days called car-free day. These days only buses and taxis are only allowed, so some people just bike, hike, or skate. The ultimate goal is to reduce smog and stress. Some Colombian cites are joining in on the event as well making this a growing imporvment campaign. This day has made many imporvments to the way of life, making the city look cleaner, cutting traffic time, and creating upscale shopping districts.

When it comes to America we can already see a decrease in car usage from 2005. If this number continues we will see beneficial environmental chages. Though the car industry will probably will be hit hard they already are discussing a plan to partner with telecommunications industry. They want to create safer public transportation and by doing so they would be saving time and conserving our resources.

There seems to be more advantages than disadvantages when it comes to limiting  car usage. I feel when everyone gets the idea that a safer and cleaner world is in the best intrest of everyone. then we will be taking the right steps to a new and better life.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
75CA5F2C8334,"My fellow citizens, some advantages of limiting car usage is that its better for the earth  and reduces the greenhouse effect.

Also there wont be as much smog and there will be a lot less pollution in the air.  Limiting the usage of cars can be a better for you. not using a car can really benifit us.

People use cars everyday for everyday things.  If people cut down on the usage of cars and took the bus or even rode a bike to work it really could help the earth.  Less cars means less of the greenhouse effect.  Less of the greenhouse effect means a better world.

Billions of people driving cars can really pollute the earth.  Paris had to ban driving because the smog was to great and needed to be cleared from the sky.  The smog was so serious that if you didnt leave your car at home you would get a fine.  almost 4,000 people were fined.  Beijing, China is one of the most polluted city in the world becouse of smog.

If you dont take a car you could walk, bike, or skate witch could be fun.  If not then you could always take the bus and still help of the earth.  If you didnt take a car to work then it could reduce traffic.  Some people enjoy riding a bike instead of a car because it reduces stress and also reduces pollution to the earth.

Limiting car use is not only good for you but also good for the earth its self.  there could be less greenhouse effect and smog.  Lets all help and limit the usage of cars.              ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D474B301CB1B,"Although a motorized vehicle provides the opportunity to transport citizens from place to place, limiting the usage of a car may be considered more beneficial. Car usage limitations allow the citizens to feel less stressed, show a decrease in air pollution and a promotion towards alternative transportation, and a decrease in habit.

The article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" (Source One), suburban pioneers have decided to permently give up cars. Although the usage of cars are generally forbidden in Vauban, its fellow citizens express that they were ""always tense... [are] much happier this way"" without the use of a car in their lives. When individuals are stressed, they're constantly worrying and not fully paying attention to surroundings; therefore, stress is considered one of the causes of vehicle crashes. Also, the congestion of traffic (if not awful enough already) will become worse with the crash which causes more individuals to become stressedl. Without the use of cars, citizens are less stressed and can go about their daily lives. Vauban is considered to be ""the most advanced experiment in low-car suburband life"" because of the attempt to make the city denser and a better place for walking has succeed.

""Paris bans driving due to smog"" (Source Two), mainly focuses on the environmental issues that car usage has been causing throughout the city. After a near-record, pollution, Paris strictly enforced a driving ban to ""clear the air of the global city"". The smog from the motorized vehicles is hazardous to our environment which therefore can be damaging to us and our bodies if we only inhale smog. Therefore, health problems are presented among the population and causes an endless loop of health concerns to be dealt with. These can be considered ""solved"" if the environmental issues are presented and dealt with immediately and effectively. Luckily, with Paris going in the right direction with the ban, health concerns will decrease as well as the smog in the air. Because of the ban that Paris has plaaced, congestion was ""down 60 percent in the capital of France"". Presented later, the smog in the city has began to clear enough. Two beneficial causes have been brought forth all because of limitations on the usage of cars.

""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" (Source Three),  explains how Bogota has a dedication day to the use without cars. According to a business man, Carlos Arturo, he explains how the day of dedication relieves stress and lowers the pollution. In order to transport oneself from place to place, citizens can walk or ride bicycles. Because of the large impact that Bogota has made, ""municipal authorites from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic"". In summary, this city has made quite an influencial mark on others. With prediction, this event could end up carrying throughout the world because of the incredible benefit that it has on our planet: the decrease of air pollution. It not only helps us, but it provides help to the world. Another article, ""The End of Car Culture"" (Source 4), explains that a study has been made on the American drivers: ""... are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". If this pattern continues, it'll provide implications for carbon emissions and the environment, seeing as ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"". If we could reduce this, our lives and breathing conditions can be improved dramatically. The quote, ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit"", means that if we can break the habit of buying cars, there will be no more habit to continue with.

In conclusion, the reduction and limitations of car usage will not only be beneficial to us, but it'll become greatly beneficial to our environment; which becomes an endless loop of helping one another out.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
BF45A993373E,"In your everyday life, just about anywhere you go you will see people traveling from place to place in their own veichles. Is the idea of us, as indivisuals, not owning our own motor veichles even an option? The idea of not being able to transport where you need to be when you need to be there is a terrorfying thought. But, when put into consideration you will find it some what reasonable.

Just think about it, all the toxins released into the air and all the traffic we can be stuck in for hours at a time! Reducing the clutter and the use of oils is enfact very possible. Residents in Vauban, Germany have copletely almost completly cut owing cars out of their community. 70 percent of Vauban's familys don't own cars while 57 percent sold their cars to move there. With mostly ""car-free"" streets with the exception of the main thoroughfare, Vauban has forbidden driveways and home garages. Though car ownership is aloud if the car- owner buys a space to park it, Vauban is leading an example of an alternative way that communities can live reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

This example has most certainly envulenced Paris enforcing a partial driving ban. pollution, a large issue in the streets of paris, is being reduced with a driving ban fining anyone who did not leave their cars at home. After five days of this ban, congestion in france was down 60 percent.

Though completely banning cars may be found inconfiniate or extreme, Bogota, colombia, takes place in this uprising craze by devoting one day a year to ""The Day Without Cars"". By doing this they strive to promote alternative transportation and reduce clutter in this capital city. Violators of this event would recieve 25$ fines. The community who participated in this event have found alternate transportation, and comfort in a break from the clutter. Businessman Carlos Arturo is quoted ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", he rode a two-seated bicycle with his wife to get from place to place. As more Colombian citied participate in the event Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the eveny and were enthusiastic. Enriqur Riera, the mayor of Asuncion, paraguay stated that ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"".

These changes are most certainly revolutionary and are changing the way we see our lifes and the way we see transportation. The idea of us working, learning, and living without indivisual automoblies is becoming to look like a huge possibilty. The fact that there are communties taking part in this act, reducing polution and clutter, show that this very well could be part of a change for us and the way we live. With the owner-ship of automobiles and drivers liscenses going down in america, Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilitier Research center, stated that ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift"".         ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
5382172C375E,"Smog is proof that pollution is a problem. Cars produce pollution from the combustion of gasoline which causes extreme smog in dense cities. Paris is one of the cities that has smog mostly from cars. So most cities are now trying to convince people that live there to switch from cars to buses, walking, or riding a bicycle.

Paris has recently set a partial driving band in there city because of record pollution levels that were being caused by automobiles. The smog in paris had become so intense and severe that they had to create a driving band to correctly limit the pollution being made. ""...Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London.""(Source 2,17). This extremly high smog ratio and prooves the pollutin from automobiles is causing the problem because after a week with the band the smog had almost cleared fully.

Colombia has the same problem as Paris. Instead of weekly baneds on even and odd licensed plated vechiles Colombia has a 100% no car day with only taxis and buses allowed into the city. This day is dedicated to help people find new ways of transportation instead of personal veichles. Any violaters of the law face a $25 dollar fine. This event is normally only in the capital of colombia and has been that way for 7 years, but this year two new cities joined in on the event (Cali and Valledupar). Because of this event 118 miles of bicycle paths and new and improved sidewalks have been constructed, so many people are able to switch from cars to bikes and walking. All of these efforts have decreased traffic and now new restraunts and shopping malls have been created. Plus there has been a signifigant decrease in smog.

America is also trying to get in on the anti-pollution ideas coming from Colombia and Paris. Since America's love for vechiles is starting to decrease they are now able to try and decrease the vehcile usage. Population growth is a high contributing factor in this because with this cities slowly become denser and denser allowing for people to be able to get to the places they need to be without a car. They can walk there along the many sidewalks in the city. In New York there is a program to share a bicycle which has increased the bridge and tunnel tolls for cars because of all the people who no longer use their cars making cars more expensive to drive. Their has also been a drop in the young adult getting their license because they simply do not need it.""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009""(Source 4, 41). Which shows most people are slowly decreasing the amount of driving they do. Driving in America is not as nesscary as it was before and it shows.

Smog is a big problem in all cities like Colombia and Paris and they are almost all taking action to decrease it and its been working. Many cities and countries goal are to decrease the amount of their citizens require driving. This will in turn cause their citizens to resort to other means of transportation and slowly decrease pollution in alot of areas. This shows why and how you can help the cause in your city by switching to non-polluting ways of traveling and how cities really do need your help to decrease pollution.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
85E980090901,"Limiting car use could be a good thing, or producing greener cars that find an alternitive fuel rather than burning fossil fuels. The american society is built around cars, and as cars have only been around for a hundred years. we have not been interested in changing what they run on. Maybe we could find a cleaner burning fuel source so that we dont have to cut cars completly out of our lifes. Alternative means like electric cars and cars that run on solar power are out there we are just not mass producing them. the cars that are out and that run on an alternative means of fuel are to expensive for the avarage american. Oil companies dont want to see this switch happen to cars that run on alterniatve fuel because then that cuts into their budget.

There are cities that have cut cars out of their society completly, like vauban germany. were they are almost completly car free. You can still own a car there you just have to pay 40,000 for a parking space, which deters most people from owning a car. 70 percent of the population in vauban do not own cars as a result. Making the air in their city alot cleaner than their neighbors. Cities like paris and beijing china have some of the worst polution records than any other city in the world. Paris got so bad that they had to inforce a driving ban just to let it clear up. Cities like these have alot of residents which means they have alot of cars. Offering free transportation on some days might intise peple to leave their car at home and help lession the rate of polution that is given off.

Their are alternatives for now like car pooling and public transportation, but as the population keeps growing we are going to have to find another means of getting around greener. Once plug in and hybrid cars become cheaper there will be more of them found on the road, but for now we can try and cut back on our car use to help the enviorment. as more places become more populated the polution is only going to increase. In america however the main source of polution is not coming from cars it is coming from factories. which burn fossil fuels and blow them right up into the atmosphere. so we need to not just focus on cars we need to also focus on factories and trying to find an alterntive fuel that can power them.

We cant just cut cars out of our life but maybe we can cut back our use of them in our society, just so we can leave a better world for genorations to come. Alternative fuel is the answer we just have to start producing cleaner burning cars and more effiecent factories.         ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
0A532E02360A,"Limiting car usage can and will benifent us in all different ways. The so called ""smart planning""is to make it where all cars are sold, or not used and people start walking everywhere they go. With doing this the pollution rate will go down and make the Earth a better place. Not everyone is doing this, Vauban, Paris, and Bogota are the main places that are trying or have started .

First, As stated in passage #2, After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC. After reading this i feel like it's a good things that people are starting to do somethng like this, i just don't find it right that people are being fined, they could have gave people a warning and gave them a time line to find out how there were going to get around and make to far places they had to go. Not everyone has a bike, and alot of people have kids. At least they are making it were the public transit is free and working certant days.

Second, In passage #3 it states that,In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. With this i'm okay about the fines because its just for one day, everyone should have enough respect for there home [Earth], to not use transportation for one day, and it's not like they just came up the idea they have been doing it for 3 years, i believe people should be fined more because if you can't have enough respect for one day then you obiously  don't deserve the money you have because it useless anyway and if not fined more money get their driving privilages tooken away.

Conclusion, i believe that going a day without any transportation would be good, maybe not just on day, but i also feel like you shouldn't gat rid of cars all the way. People being fined for not wanting to just do it for one day should get there cars tookin away, they don't deserve to ride around and polute our air.

The whole idea of cars and americans are one of the easly seen together thing like peanut butter and jelly. The thing is though cars lead to the second amount of pollutant in america right behind powerplants. This is bad for both the safety and enviroment of people, because gas emmissions lead to smog. Smog is a deadly mixture of carbon and fog, it is created when fog is settling in a city or area and then with carbon that is being released by cars they mix causing a deadly black toxic fog that can serously hurt peoples lungs when they breathe it in.

By limiting car usage, like for example the city of Vauban, Germany where city are prety much ""car-free"", you can still buy a car and have it but its pointless to do so because everything is by your house and if you need to pick up grocery or such its down the road.

I mean im sure there is more reasions on why limiting car usages is good for example less cars lead to car accidents, your insurance would be lower because of price and demand, better air quality, better health quality both pyshically and mentally from all the exrcising you have to do. i mean i understand the question when it said ""must be based on ideas and informantion given"" but these can also be reasons on why car free sub urban cities are good. Think about it you have a city with no pollutant and or cars are banned. There are cities like this all ready for example there is a town in Maine where the people banned all cars! People are on bikes just getting there stuff, and if you do happen go into this town with a car you are fined $320.

One advantage of limiting car usage is that there would be less pollution. Source 4 says, ""If the pattern persits- and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" This shows that if you cut out some of your car usage there will be less carbon in the air. Which would lead to less pollution and a better living environment for everybody. Source 3 says, ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The person who said this was talking about the car free day that occurs in Colombia. Going just one day without your car can have an impact on the carbon emissions and help bring down the amount of air pollution in that area.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is new community set ups. Source 1 says, ""But it's basic percepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" This shows that the government is willing to set up the community in a different way to limit the amount of car usage on a daily basis. Which also makes your shopping trips more convinant because the stores you need or want to go to are walking distance from your house. Source 3 says, ""Parks and sports cneters also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been repalced by broad smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. This explains how the city is being remodeled to help encourage people to start using their cars less and to be able to walk to many places instead of driving there by bringing these places closer to their houses.

187501946AC2,"For quite some time, there's been deep controversies over automobiles and increased carbon emissions poisoning cities worldwide. China, one the most densely populated cities in the world, is also the most polluted with millions of cars on the roads each and every, releasing toxic gases into the city's atmosphere, and creating a ginormous smog. Even in Paris, there were laws that prohibited drivers with even and odd license plates from driving on certain days, due to the increase in pollutants in the city's air. There are many things that can be done to prevent our cities and capitals from becoming toxic danger zones, but all of them need a little initiative to get started.

As said before, Paris once put a ban on motorists with certain plate numbers from driving on specific days. On the Monday the act started, motorists with even plate numbers had to leave their cars at home, or face a 22-euro¹ fine. As many as 4,000 drivers had been fined, accoring to

Reuters , an international news agency based in London, and 27% of those who were fined had their vehicles impounded due to their reaction from said fine. Traffic on Paris streets had decreased by a total of 60%, significantly easing the flow of transportation and lowering the amount of harmful emissions exhausted into the air. This was enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates the following Tuesday.

Three years ago, in Bogota, Colombia, a program had been enacted that has spread to other surrounding countries and cities today known as, the Day Without Cars. On that day, only buses and taxis would be permitted on the roads, allowing the streets of the capital city of 7 million to be devoid of any chaotic congestion, clearing most of the roads. The goal of the program was to enbale and promote the use of alternative transportation and reduce smog. Any violators were charged with a $25 fine. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses, all for the sake of improving the region and getting rid of nasty smog clouds. Even though grey clouds overhead had poured rain on Bogota occasionally, the turnout incredibly immense. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Antanas Mockus, mayor of Bogota. Other cities such as Cali and Valledupar, also joined in on the fun. Parks and rec centers emerged throughout the city, shattered and askew sidewalks were transformed into smoother and broader sidewalks, and new restaurants and upscal shopping districts have popped up as well. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" says Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay.

So whether it be passing laws on driving cars, pooling in with friends, or just simply taking the bus, there's always something that can be done to limit the usage of cars in today's societies. Alternative transportation may not be as ideal or convenient as taking the family Mustang to work, but it's all for the hope of an easier travel to our workplace and having cleaner air to breathe during the day, and not choking on toxic clouds of death. With the combined efforts of all of us, the adavntages of limited car use are extensive as they are beneficial.

Maybe bike to your job or even jog. Exercise and get work at the same time!

Go out for the night to find yourself intoxicated, what will you do? Most would try to drive home while drunk. Then leading to a misfortunate disaster, or car acident. Streaming through the halls with a blurred vision of uneasiness, finally realizing you're in a hospital soon to be in the ER. Then few moments later the doctor reaveils the ugly truth to your beloved ones. Anthing might happen during those times of intoxication, you might even take a innocent life. Could you bear for a innocent lifes death? Think before consuming alchohal.

In conclusion, igniting your vehicle , return the lifeless box to an uproar of sounds , and let the fumes escape your car. Doing this could cause a invetiable end towards the future. Change the minds of those who once were toxic users undergo a change to hybrids to reduce our decisions affect. Or maybe regret having a car and taking remorse of others or even grieve amongst them, all for your choice.                                                   ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
8BFA9CC64A02,"There are few people who can can imagine living a full life in this generation without thewse glorified metal boxes with wheels attached to them; even fewer set living a life similar to that as a goal. The advantages of limiting the amount of cars being used are suprisingly unique due to the dwindling amount of disadvanteges there are. Some of these advantages include reduction in greeenhouse gas emissions and that there will be a reduction in smog. It is always nice to see humanity band together, willingly or forcefully, to work for a common good.

Let us begin with the most pressing issue: preserving the environment. Studies have shown that nearly ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" come from passenger cars (Rosenthal 1, 5). Reducing these greenhouse gases, which pose a threat to the Earth's atmosphere, would be an improvement, although slow, still an improvement nonetheless. While this would not be the immmediately noticable of changes, making an effort to cleanse our cities of pollution would be.

Moving on, some places have taken this matter into their own hands, matters that some would describe as extreme. Paris, France is one of these examples, ""enforcing a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city...motorists...ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine..."" (Duffer, 10-11).It is pleasant to see a city taking this matter into their own hands. This ban, though, did spark an uproar on the Internet, but it did die down. Many approaches to cleansing city-air have been drastic, but others such as in Columbia, had some sort of event where ""the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" (Selsky, 21). This did allow a public freedom, despite there still being a fine in place. The remarkable fact of this is that even though cars are being banned, a large portion of the targeted population actuallly do not mind the change, even ""'the rain hasn't stopped people from participating'""(Selsky, 23).

Suprisingly enough, this car-ban revolution is still going on today. Many more people are starting to realize the benefits to the ban. Elisabeth Rosenthal, in her article

""The End of Car Culture""

even adds in that many ""sociologists believe...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment...""(34). This simply furthers the ideal that humanity as a whole CAN see a chance to change, wants to desperately do so, and WILL do so...eventually.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

1CF00BDAE6BB,"Fresh clean air, spotless streets and no car accidents. Welcome to Vauban, Germany.  The 5,500 people of this town are a part of something that this day and age has never seen.  The residents here have given up their cars, and are a part of an experiment where their streets are completely ""car-free""!

After this experiment started in Germany, it's population would agree that the tense-ness they were feeling with their cars is now gone.  This new way of living was started in 2006 and other countries would agree that it is a smart move and an affordble way of living.  The residents of Vauban have more money to spend on other necessities such as clothing and food, or maybe some entertainment, even.  All of their monthly car payments and gasoline bills have ceased to exist because they simply have no reason to pay the prices anymore without a car.  Citizens of this little town don't have to walk (or ride their bikes) far because the city has thought this movement out very well.  All of the stores are placed just a walk away rather than their malls being placed on a distant highway.  Public transportation has become more accessible and there is more space for side-walks rather than roads. For some, this is a dream town for them and their children. There isn't much of a worry about air polution or accidents.

If you were to compare Vauban's air pollution to Bejing's the difference would be austounding.  Just last night, NBC Nightly News showed the city of Bejing where the smog was so dense that visibility was reduced to almost none.  The majority of the population won't go outside with out wearing a mask to protect them selves.  All of the air pollutants could be harming us even with a potential risk of lung cancer.  The mayor of Bejing has even made a statement talking about his city's air, and the risk and threat it poses to his residents.  Even the common person will recognize that the gas emissions from a car's tail pipe equals pollution.  Paris officials knew this too, and understood that their city had an air cleanliness issue.  So, in an effort to make the City of Love more pleaseable they limited what cars could drive on what days.  They enforced a partial driving ban to clear the smog in the city.  For a short amount of time only even-numbered cars, for example, could drive on a Monday.  If odd numbered cars were on the street then there would be a 22 Euro fine (that equals 31 USD's).  After 5 days, car traffic and conjestion was down around 60% on the streets, and the air pollution started clearing.

Fatal crashes are among the one of the third highest risks for all American's.  Some states have even made it a law to not text and drive, and in some states there probably is a ""no talking on the cell phone law"" too!  If the number of cars are reduced -or taken away all together- I feel that the lives of the American people are less at risk.  Every day, and not just in this country, hundreds of people are injuring them selves or getting killed by distracted driving, hit-and-runs, and driving under the influence.  It could be beneficial to cut down the car usage and up the number of public transportation avaible to the public.

In any major city you go to in the United States, all around you, you can notice the large amounts of people walking to where they need to go.  In Washington D.C. bike rentals are

EVERYWHERE.  And if you don't want to take a bike then take the D.C. Metro.  The same will go for New York City or anywhere with a large population of people.  You will also notice that city folk tend to be slimmer than others.  That is most likley due to the fact that they walk everywhere.  Just like I mentioned before, like Vauban, eveything in a major city is usually within walking distance.  As we all know, walking is a form of excersize and it is recomemnded by health officials that each person should get at least 1 hour every day and it is very believeable that a city go-er gets plenty more than the recomended.  The first lady has started a program for children in an effort to get them moving, fit and healthy as well. Some children in New York City won't even drive a single day in their lives- or worry about what could happen if they do.  Also, the Capital of Colombia-Bogota- has organized a day for it's residence to avoid taking their car.  It is called the Day Without Cars and the major goal is to reduce smog and promote walking.

All in all.. Cars, the most dangerous driving force in our daily lives, should be cut back on.  Even with study after study coming out and proving just how danger and non-beneficial to our health they are, they are slowly losing populatiry.  If this pattern stays consistant then sociologists say that it will have great effects on the atmosphere, and our healthy lives that we all live.     ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
AD0EF541297C,"Cars are part of our daily routines, they have been around for so long that we can't even remember when they first showed up, but did you know that people are starting to use other means for transportation?. Studies have shown that the number of miles driven in the united states has dropped steadily ever sice 2005, and as of april 2013, the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below the the peak.

Part of the reason lies in the recession, americans with a low income can't afford to buy new cars; not mentioning the unemployed, and now that recovery is under way, the next few years will be telling if the decrease will stop, or continue. But looking at the bright side, if the pattern persists (and many believe it will) it will be beneficial towards carbon emissions and the enviroment, without considering the fact that car transportstion is one of the largest source of america's emitions.

America isn't the only country that has seen a major decrease in car transportation, other places have taken steps to decrease the use of cars. For example, in VAUBAN, Germany, the residents of this community have given up their cars, thats right!, Vauban's are completely ""car-free"". Owning a cars is allowed, but they vanly be parked in two places, garages that can be purchased for $40,000, and of course, a home. As a result, seventy percent of the popullation does not own a car.

But why are they doing this?. Well, automobiles are used widely all around the globe, and that id a huge impediment to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Cars are responsable for 12 percent of green house emissions in Europe... and up 50 percent in some car-intesive area in the United States, that's why some places are triying to stop using vehicles, the advantage of not using cars relies on the fact that cars are dangerous to our planet, and we have to take care of our planet.

Finally(and most importantly)France and Colombia are taking major steps to fight the over-use of cars. Sice Paris has more smog than any other European capital, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numberd plates the following day, as a result congestion was down 60 percent  in Paris after 5 days. And in Bogota, Colombia, there has been a ""car-free day"" for over three years now in an attempt to promote alternative transportation, peole who refuse not use their cars are fined with a $25 dollar fine, because of this, the turnout has been large. And it has led to the construction oh 118 miles of bicycle paths.

So.... do you still want to use car?... or a bicycle?.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E78B32F820D3,"Have you ever walked outside and taken a deep breath of fresh air but then you realise that the air youre breathing isnt alll that fresh? Thats because air pollution has greatly increased in  recent years and the number one reason for air pollution is the exhaust from your cars. Yes, the amount of cars in the world has increaesed dramtically in the last 10 years. While this is good that the luxury of owning an auto mobile it has also put a burden on the earth and future generations. while cars have made it easier for our day to day lives the amount of pollution in the world has become too high to not do something about it now. instead of taking the modern convenience of a car what if you decided to ride your bike to work for a change.

The fact that the amount of pollution is ever imncreasing should be enough of a reason to limit car usage. Instead of driving every time you go somewhere if you just rode a bike or walked when its convienient you could make a difference in the world. You dont have to completely stop driving your car but just limit the amount of times you do drive and that little extra effort will make a big difference in the long run. the world is facing an epidimic in which we could not have clean air for our future generations to be able to take their kids to the park and enjoy a nice day in the sun.

Not only is limiting your car usage better for the enviroment it is also better for your body. When  you decide to ride your bike or walk opposed to driving your car you are getting a work out from doing so. This may not seem like much but when you look at how often you go places the numbers start to add up. In the ten minutes that you would take to go to the bank you could spend fifteen minutes riding your bike and getting exercise multiple times through out the day. thiss can also give you much more free time to do something physically active that you ignored because of a car, with the motivation to go out pollution free you can start up running or even learn how to skate and enjoy the go.

When you decide to make the change and not drive as much you open up endless possibilities for what you could do instead of sitting in one place driving. You become more active in the community and this helps the enviroment and you as a person. limited driving has been proved to be a great idea in more ways than you would think. Just doing your part can help out.

In conclusion the facts are all here that limited car usage is the best way to go for decreasing air pollution and making you a better you. It will help the future become a brighter and cleaner place to live.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

merica itself is going down the drain,and its going down hard. Gas prices going up,the rise of obesity,and with Ninety precent of Americans staying home and watching T.V. instead of going outside and taking a nice walk. As an American it sounds crazy that somebody would get rid of their car,borderline insanity. However,in their cases they were justified to do so. To pay for a large garage on your new home which already cost you all that money you were saving is just not right. That's why these very few people have decided to throw away their keys and pick up a pair of sneakers in order to combat the extreme amount of prices,all for a piece of luxury we bought when we were sixteen.

I f there is a place to start this off price is the best option. As I said before the prices that come along after you had the car are rediculous. All the taxes,insurance,not to mention if you want a house with a garage it cost you at-least forty thousand dollars along with your new home,as said in paragraph two. If you walk up to a person and spell this out to them they'd might say something like ""Well its a necessity to get around and another stepping stone in life"" saying this now,its not. I can make a choice and to whoever is reading this you look at this and ask yourself,maybe I don't need this junky Sedan to get around I have two legs and feet to get around. There's my question for you,would you rather pay lets say Twenty thousand on a New or Used car,or would you rather pay Twenty maybe even Ten dollars for a pair of new sneakers/running shoes. Take your time and think it out. While you do that,I'm going to go to my second option.

S

o lets move onto the cars themselves. A car in America is the basic standing point for which people get around. Aside from those with Motorcycles,Skateboards,Bicycles and Roller skates. Remember when you just got your lisence and you went with your parents to pick out your first car? Chances are,it was junky used pile of garbage,if not then congratulations on the new and expensive Dodge Camero. What are you gonna do first? Go out and hang with your friends? Nope! You're going to Allstate to pay for insurance,then making sure you have to pay every payment on your car so that it doesn't get Repoed,you might end up getting a second job,which leaves you zero time to yourself or to hang out with your friends. All because you wanted that shinney new car,or the used up hunk of scrap. Heck if you get a used car,chances are you're going to have to put in some work time to replace the parts and fix it up to make it look nice,making your money situation even harder. Not to mention the polution that they give off,not wanting to be the hippie in this situation but its true.

Paris itself enforced a partial ban on driving to clean up the smog that surrounded the French tourist hotspot ,as shown through paragraph Ten through Nineteen. I feel like I've made my point here,and now to close this up with my final paragraph.

T

o shut down this whole car talk,I'm going to give you an image of what it would be like to get rid of your car,if you're still reading this that is. Imagine that you finally tore apart you insurance bill because some kid chucked a rock through your window and burnt your 'Notice of Reposetion' on your car. Then you go back to the dealer and hand your keys and say ""Keep the car,I don't need it anymore."" as you then walk towards the nearest shoe store and pick yourself out a nice and comfortable pair of sneakers,and even get yourself a brand new bike. Now you can focus on keeping your house/apartment payments up,and whats this? You're getting thinner? More healthy? Its almost as like choosing to get rid of your car put your life on track to a healthier life style. Now you're walking to work with your amazing sneakers,and brand new pair of Six pack abs,good for you!

I think I've made my point clear. A car maybe great,but its not something we need to survive.

By limitig the usage of cars the air will have less polution and that means better air for us to breath. In france diesal makes up 67 percent of vehicles, witch is definately not helping the polution problem. If people use their cars less that means that they save money on gas. Ovcourse the proble is the smog in that country so that os why they want to limit the driving. Like it says over the past two decades they want to make the cities denser, and better for walking in the suburbs. In the suburbs make i more compact and more accessible to public transportation with less space for parking. All the development since world war II has been centered on the car. David Goldberg said a fast growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the united states ... who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars.

Everybody will have enough money to get what they want, on top of the money they get from working.

Instead of spending money on cars, we can spend that on neccesities. We will be able to walk, bike or use the public transportation given to us.

EC9894AEB172,"Reducing car usage is becoming a big thing in a lot of cities around the world. In some cities they're developing ""car-free"" days, a day without cars, to lower air pollution. Too many people are using cars and this is causing traffic jams and pollution in the air, which is not good for the environment. I believe that limiting car usage is an advantage because it can help prevent air pollution, traffic jams, and can make people open their mind to use other ways of transportation. Most cities in different countries are evolving and people are liking ""car-free day"".

Limiting car usage can prevent congestion in the streets which causes the air to be polluted. According to Source 2, Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, so Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog. This really helps clear the air for polluted cities.

The population is growing everywhere, especially cities like Bogota, Colombia with 7 million. According to Source 3, it was the third straight year that cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work leaving the streets of this capital city without any traffic jams. The turnout was large and people are liking this new change. For example, a businessman named Carlos Arturo Plaza said

""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said,

""These people are generating a revoluntionary change, and this is crossing borders.""

Since these cities have made this change, there has been a great outcome from this.

There are many different ways you can go to places without having to use cars all the time. For example in Source 4, Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University, says

""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift.""

In this source it explains that the internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Same with the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. With all of these changes, people who have stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.                                                                                                        ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In some countrys there are days were people dont use cars at all. Theres even a whole community/neighborhood thats placed a ban on all driving and car ownership.

Much of this change was caused by a need to reduce pollution rates and to cut down on green house gasses.

We're living because of nature, without nature we can't live. People finally react because of the warnings of nature, for example: Smog in Paris, ""despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota"". They finally saw the problems that they caused. So that, Gorvernment found some solutions to have less smog, so they banned driving but none all of them will stop driving if they don't talk about money, so they made some fine (31$) if they don't leave their cars at home. As they expected, not all of the french people obeyed it because we all know that Paris is an extremly busy city that can't avoid of using cars even if they have to pay. But people have to see how the environment is really bad because of cars.

Limiting car usage is very important and it's mostly because of the environment, because the number of people using cars is increasing every year. The nature is now becoming scary because of us.

A5C1E31219F6,"Decreasing car usage would serve as a benefit to our communities and enviorment. Many countries are already being influenced by the new trend. As proven that without cars we could provide ourselves with cleaner air, physically healthier bodies and a more pleasant social atmosphere.

With the purchase of a car comes the consequences to our only enviorment. In ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", it is shown that ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in some car-intesive areas in the United States"". If we started to limit car usage these numbers could drop giving us cleaner air to breathe and a longer lasting enviorment. Some heavily populated cities such as Beijing, China are so polluted that there is a smog covering the entire city. The thick, grey cloud over Beijing is caused primarily by the greenhouse gas emissions from cars and various other pollution sources. Not only is Beijing to be held accountable but also cities in Europe such as Paris. From source 2, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", it is said that ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"", because of the over usage of diesel fuel vehicles Paris had to put a hault to motorists for a few days. If Parisians were not complient with the ban they were fined with 22.

Giving up your vehicle for a day or two may seem like an impossible task but if you were not to have it there would be health benefits. We created the car for a reason, to get places quicker, safer, and more efficiently. Now that we successfully done that and have been doing it for quite some time, we have become much too dependent on them. I'm not saying to completely give up the usage of our beloved vehicles but just become more aware of when and where to we use them. If people used their cars a little less and started walking places, biking, skateboarding, etc. we would have a much healthier community. People wouldn't be so lazy or unfit and it would create a more sociable community.

Limiting car usage would enhance the idea of being social with your friends, family, a neighbor, or anybody for that matter. You could see more people walking down the street as opposed to being inside a car with a limited number of people. It would break down barriers of being afraid if you are walking alone, instead you'd have plenty of around who are mostly aware of their enviorment.

Car usage should be decreased a bit more than it is now for a better community and enviorment. We only have one planet and we should do as much as possible to try and keep it as clean as possible for as long as possible.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
FA7634A1120E,"Imagine this, Living in a world where pollution no longer exists, where cars have been limiting due to important reasons and where stress no longer affects individuals that drive. Cars have played indeed an important role in our lives since a long time. They do make us get to places faster but they are also making some individuals more lazier than before. They have affected our atmosphere which can affect every living organisms on Earth in the nonfar future. In my opinion cars should not be limited, the companies that make them should just change the way they work.

First of all, less and less people no longer walk or take public transportation in places where every individual in the population owns a car. According to source number 1 paragraph 3 ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". This is important because it shows that when individuals own a car they are always going to fight against state laws, traffic, people on the streets, meaning that they are always going to stress everytime they ride their car. This could be a lot different if cars were limited for every single individual or if cars somehow where seperated from people's places for walking.

Second of all, our planet's atmosphere has gotten more and more polluted than when cars were not a big thing to people. Pollution is something that some people do not take seriously. It can affect our lives in a big way. According to source number 2 pargraph 1 ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drivin ban to clear the air of the global city"" meaning that the air was being contaminated due to cars. This is important because cars are affecting our atmosphere in a way that can affect us all by destroying our atmosphere and leaving every living organism on Earht with no oxygen.

Last but not least, Scientist's have invented cars that are electric meaning that they dont use gasoline. This is a good thing, because it can reduce pollution for a better atmosphere. Another way that pollution can be reduced is by making more and more individuals use public transportation. This can help by them not using their gasoline powered cars that pollute the air. In conclusion, cars will not be limited in the near future they will just change the way they work.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
FD48976C9913,"""All of our development since World War II has been centered around the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. David Goldberg says this in means of trying to decrease car usage, such as in Vauban, Germany. Car usage after World War II continued increasing for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of miles driven started to decrease. In the year 2013, the miles driven in the United States decreased nearly 9% since 2005 and was equal to the amount of miles driven in 1995. Throughout the whole world people have been experiencing problems with air pollution and due to that many have been trying to decrease the usage of cars in different ways to slow this air pollution.

To start off, pollution from cars has been a large factor of the air pollution today. In the United States, 50 percent of the greenhouse emissions in the United States is caused by passenger cars. Then there is Paris who has been experiencing heavy smog. Recently, it has had days of near-record pollution. Reason for such high levels of smog or air pollution can be attributed to a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France. Then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3% of the vehicles are diesel.

Next, is how some people attempt to slow the car pollution. The first example of a community trying to decrease the usage of cars is Vauban, Germany. In Vaubaun street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. For the most part, Vauban is car free. The only way to use cars in Vauban is to carpool because there is only two places to park in the whole city and they are two large parking garages on the edge of development. Then you have to pay $40,000 to keep a spot. 70% of the people in Vaubaun do not own cars. Anoter example is Paris, who is one of the biggest air pollutants next to Beijing. They have been trying to decrease the smog in their area through slowing the amount of cars on the road. What they did is make it so only cars wih even-numbered license plates could drive one day and odd-numbered license plates the next. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined due to this policy, which showed some  reluctance in following the plan. This did not matter though because the smog cleared enough to where the polcy only lasted for one day. Another attempt in lowering the usage of cars was Bogota's car-free day. In this program it is quite obvious that it was just a day of no car usage at all. During this event Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. Even in the rain people of Bogota participated in this event. Then there is one other case of lowering the usage of cars, which is the natural way, having people just grow away from the car. This is currently happening in the United States, one of if not the largest car users. Like I said earlier since 2005 the usage of cars has decreased. Whether this trend stays in motion or not depends on the idealism of the current and future generations.

To conclude, the use of cars is creating problems in air pollution and due to this there have been attempt to slow this usage. Then back to what David Goldberg said the development of the car needs to stop being the center of attention. So instead what we have to do is take our attention away from using the car to ways of finding ways to limit the cars use.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. Cars also cause pollution, which can be deadly to the enviorment. Cars can create smog which could be prevented by having one car free day. People who have cars also are more stressed than those without cars. A car free city would most likely see parks and sports center bloom throughout the city and uneven pitted sidewalks replaced by broad smooth sidewalks. Rush hour restrictions would dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

Americans would save so much money if they didnt buy a car. It seems as americans are buying less cars each year. Bill Ford laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. Changes are being made by people to limit the use of cars and its a great idea.

Life is much easier without cars. The world could be different and better if improvments are made daily and everyone contributes to limit the use of cars. Too much harm comes from using a car.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
2C27E003116B,"The truth is that we are too dependent on using vehicles for transportation, we've invested our entire lives on them and now we've congested our communites and streets with them, growing mutually with their presence as they slowly but surely harm our environment, but if we limited the use of these vehicles, much good would come out of it as a result. People would benefit greatly if car usage was limited. Think of all the money people would save because they wouldn't have to spend so much on gas and maintence of their cars. Having a car is a privilege and a great responsibility, which means it's also stressful to have and care for one. In developed countries and cities, the streets are bustling with activity that comes with nothing but pollution and congestion, so only good can come out of limiting care usage.

When we think of automobiles we immediately consider factors such as money, maintenance, safety, and particularly for this case, emissions, and emissions have been an issue that causes much controversy and complaint throughout the community due to its toll on the environment and its inhabitants, and limiting car usage is the best solution to this problem. There has been a profound shift of thought during this day and age about how the environment is being negatively affected by emissions and how vehicles play a great role in it. The first source stated, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" In places like Vauban, Germany, it's people have given up cars for the sake of the environment and the community, and although it's a small town, they've adjusted to the use of no cars and many of the locals say they enjoy the change. For example, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two said, ""When I had a car I was alaways tense. I'm much happier this way."" This proves that limiting car use would not only help the environment but it would better the people as well.

If you look at the second source and notice what's going on in Paris with smog due to it's constant vehicle use, it further explains why car usage should be limited. ""[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" That

David Goldberg from the first source said, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.""

F24192427334,"The more we use cars the worse it is for our environment. There are advantages of limiting cars use and disadvantages. The advantages will ban the usage of cars in some states like German in the suburb area.

Im going to start off by saying that using cars is harmful for the environment. According to the first resource giving to us ""Passenger cars are resonsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emisiions in Europe ... and upto 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" But people are saying its a good idea to ban cars. Heidrun Walter states that ""When i had a car i was always tense, i'm much happier this way."" So to some people there are advatages of limiting car use.

Well we also need to clear the air of the global city. It states that ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city."" But humans are also claiming that its making the streets better. ""cold night and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" and also smooth sidewalks are being built and parks and sport centers have bloom throughout the city. Rush hour restriction have cut traffic dramatically and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. The goal is the promote alernative transportation and reduce smog. The driving has decreased 23 percent from the years 2001-2009. That shows you that America's attachment to cars has decreased. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and decreased afterwards. The number of miles driven per person was about 9 percent below the peak and equals to where the country was in January 1995. Some people are saying its cause Americans couldnt afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyways so they wouldnt need any type of transportation. Michael Sivake states ""What's most intriguing is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before turndown."" Even New York's new bike sharing program and skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities , as do a proliferation of car sharing programs across the nation.

To Conclude there are many advantages of limiting the use of cars.  The environment is doing beter without vehicles and we need to clear up the air of the global city.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
268A9E3B15FF,"Everyone loves fast, loud cars. The kind that make loud screeches, and speed away from the police in our favorite action movies. But in a social sense personal vehicles seem to be going out of style, especially in America's youth. Not only are less young people attaining their licenses, but simply less people are driving. Some countires put restrictions on driving to limit the excessive ammount of polution produced, and finding the effects to be quite positive. Is it time for the world to move on, and stop using this massive cause of pollution on our planet?

In the years of 2001-2009 there appears to be a very noticable social shift. Young drivers, between 16 & 21, have started to give up the desire to operate a motor vehicle, we know this from the 23% decrease in legal teens on the road. First thinking about that, I felt it was a bit exaggerated and mostly caused by urbanized cities where everything is walking distance. But then I thought, not about others but about me, personally. I recently turned 16 and I have yet to attain my license. My lack of desire to get it shocked my parents, they would continuously tell me how quickly they got their license. It's not that I didn't want to drive, I just didn't have the effort to pay the ridiculous sum of money to sit through headache inducing online modules that our state requires.

The average number of miles driven by American citizens is also steadily decreasing. Studies show the number of miles per person peaked in 2005. Eight years after that in April of 2013, the average had dropped nearly 9%. This may not seem like an abundance (it is), but that put the number right back where it was in January of 1995. That means after the driving peak, eight years went by, and then it was right back where it was 10 years before the climax. Not only is the driving of young people in America dropping, but the entire driving population in our country has a whole has dropped.

Many countries are noticing the changes in their enviroment, the large amount of pollution that their land is withstanding. In an effort to fight this, places like Paris, France as well as Bogota, Columbia have initialed ""no-drive-days."" France being more congested, ordered that people with even number plates not drive one day and then odd number plates not drive the next to reduce smog and congestion in their city. Smaller places like Bogota and a few cities surrounding it have gotten their population to be completely on board with parking the cars for a day or two. Maybe people are starting to catch on, its not smart to intentionally pollute our planet for our convenience.

Socially, car use is declining. For the sake of the only planet we have, car use is definitely declining. The only ""consequence"" is that large car producers will go out of business if they can't think of a different product to provide. But morally, should we focus on benifitting big business or our earth? Cars are a very convenient source of transportation and walking everywhere wouldn't necessarily be fun. But when the consequences are weighed, which would be more benificial in the long run? So lets abolish cars, for the only planet we have.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

The only thing citizens should avoide is ""accidends"" because then you won't no car to get any where, But it's always good to have a walk somewhere to get moving and get energy and not be lazy. I mostly preffer citizens should use there car to do things they need to do before going home so they don't have to keep going in and out the house wasting gas, and just wasting your time to relax after Work , School , and Ect.. Cars need a lot of taking care of too because if you have'nt check your car yet just in case if anything is wrong with it your car could randomly break down.

Theirs citizens out there that can be a recless driver ad could hit another car,people of side walks, and run into someting. I thinks citizens should at least once in a while use a bike, Skate, or take a public transformation, to move more get out the house. Most other countries don't even use cars to get places they use bikes,carges with the horses taking you,skate,or walk they do that because they feel they don't need cars to get places it get them out and do something,Why you think other counties have lots of activies,prades,places so close togther to make thing healthier and better for the people.

At the end I feel like we should go out more and use less car activity and do more thing to get out and move around. Citizens wants to feel safer start useing bicycles,public transformation, or walk, it's better to be safe then sorry. Also maybe less accidences and more better air to breath and feel safe.

But as good as driving seems there are also many negative things that occur when driving a car. But the affects of limited driving can potentially have a positive impact on our lives and our enviorment.

In our world a large number of people drive cars to get to work, school and many other places. Due to people driving, there have been serveral negative effects to our planet. Due to people driving from place to place there are very high polution levels in our atmosphere, from the exhuast that the car lives off. For example, in Europe cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions and in the United States it is fifty percent of green house gas emissions. This can potentially damage our enviorment and hurt our planet. But not all of this has to be negative. Many countries have been setting up days or even banding cars in general to decrease levels or pollution and promot limited car use is a positive thing. This is an attempt to help clean up our enviorment. On the positive side if we were to stop using passenger cars for transporation our enviorment would be alot cleaner more suitable to live in. If we stop driving and even owning cars it could potentially have an impact on our personal lifes and make us more relaxed and feel happier. For example a women by the name of Heidrun Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". Many countries are currently making a serious effort to stop the use of cars in all. Some countries have completely wiped out the usage of cars and have gone to riding bikes, walking, and even taking the bus. These efforts can only have a positive effect on our enviorment. If every country tries to enforce the fact that cars are damaging our enviorment then potentially the pollution levels and the smog levels will begin to decrease and maybe even depleat.

Passenger cars in the world is a bigger issue then everyone thinks. But if everyone pitches in to the idea that no cars equals a better society then I believe that Passenger cars will soon be gone for good.

We have gotten so used to driving cars that i don't know what some people would do if they had to give up their means of transportation. Its also another factored that what if someone had to drive a long ways, it would take them even longer to get where they're going. Its a very serious topic when you think of how much time one person spends in a car.

Well Paris has enforced a driving ban to help clear the air of pollution. ""On mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" Many people, in Paris, were fined for driving on the wrong day. Paris wanted to do something about the smog that was surrounding their beautiful city, so they figured if there wasnt as many cars polluting the air then the smog would go away. It actually helped having cars stop driving on certain days because the smog actually cleared.

""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" American has always had a thing for cars but lately that seems to be a false statement. In the more populated citys, people are using more bikes and less cars. Its easier to get around a city where there are thousands of people on the streets alone. Internet maybe a huge reason why theres less dringing because it feels like your more connected with your friends and family without actually having to go anywhere. The need for cars in the U.S. has gone down dramadically.

Ever been to a place where there are no cars aloud. Well in Vauban, Germany there is a place where if you want to go there you have to give up your car. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden is this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg.""

In all actuality, how many people dont realize how long they spend of their life in a car? If one day all cars in the world were banned, how would everyone recate?

However, Government intervention on limiting the amount of car usage may prove to be a genuinely good cause. It may prove to accomplish what Government was first formed to do; help shape the world to make it a better place to co-exist, not only with each other, but with the whole Earth.

At fist, it may seem a little crazy in our day and age to actually reverse the climb of our use of technology and innovation, like vehicles. After all, isn't that what we're supposed to do? Isn't it natural to constantly evolve as time passes? Well, cars aren't natural, and they destroy what is.

We are facing dangerous pollution; ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" (Source 2, 10). This is alarming to me and many people who care for the Earth. Every day, we're facing new headlines of negativity, and although whether Kim Kardashian's dress fits or not is upsetting, I think we need to focus on more important things and expell the negativity we're always bashed with. We could be developing things that will really make an impact, like new breakthrough sciences on space, medical sciences, and so much more. Instead, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" (Source 1, 7).

But, there is hope in all this. Already, we're seeing improvements. ""The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company"" (Source 4, 32). Maybe reversing the climb of our use of cars isn't so hard after all; we can hit the ground running.

A reduction in the ownership of cars has also shown a surprising improvement of psychological well-being. In Vauban, Germany, they have almost completely cut out automobile use in their community. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor"" (Source 1, 3). It sounds like people can be much happier without the constant buzz of cars coming and going. The mention of children also makes me think that it would be a much safer environment to raise children without the stress of parents having to worry if their children would be safe with so many cars about. I think everyone remembers their parents telling them time and time again to look both ways before crossing, and then double check, and then hold their hand, and watch out for right-turning traffic. A reduction in automobile use, in this case, is directly related to the stress parents have over their children when doing something so simple as crossing the street.

In addition, a reduction in automobile use and ownership gives the local Government something more beneficial to focus on, rather than spending millions on re-paving roads; ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Source 3, 28). With this change, local Government can focus on really improving the standard of living; more job openings with more buisinesses, easier travel (despite what one might think) during rush-hour, and a higher level of general safety with less danger of car accidents.

All in all, I think it will be a hard transition to go through if Government does plan to get involved in the reduction of car usage. It's easy to make bad habits, but it's hard to break them. However, if we do succeed, we will see a huge improvement on the environment and the standard of living, and it will be really worth it. These are not views or opinions; these are facts.

if we limit our car usage people would start walking wich is good. people are getting so used to cars that they have no excersise all they do is get in there car go to work and home wich is not good. if we limit the car usage all those people will have to walk wich would be better so they can have some type of excersise. if people needed to travel far distances they would have public transportation.

if we do limit the car usage there will be less pollution in the air. and if there is less pollution in the air there will be less congestion. there would be less smog in the air. where would be less people getting sick.

another advantage we will have is that people will be saving money. people wouldnt have to pay for gas. since people are walking they wouldnt have to pay for car insurance. people wont need to pay for car damages. and with all the money that people save most people wouldnt go in debt.

this are some reasons why i think we should limit car usage. now you write to inform our citizens why we should limit the car usage.                                                                 ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
8B0FA5DB7BC1,"In my opinion limiting the usage of cars would be great. Some people use there viechles for the stupidest reasons when they could walk or even ride a bike. It would be better for our enviorment and even people. some advantageas of limting car usage would be cleaner air and people would get excercise.

Alright we'll who wants to be in town and smell the nasty fumes of a car? Not me i would love to smell the fresh air. When you limit the usage of cars  this could happen not only would you hvae clean air but the people around you would be satified with the results. According to the article""Car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" they claim ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" With this being said happier people may give people a chance to get job or even have a better enviorment to be around.

In addition people could get excersise from limiting car usage. when people get excersise it means the obiesity levels can go down and make the place better for everyone. also from people having an activity they dint have ti sit on there butt anymore. They can actualy get up and attemp to find a job to benifit their family and the community.

In conclusion people can benifit from this no car usage rule from having cleaner and get exersise. those all play a factor in each other.                   ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
CEA8008D03D4,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. For example, to decrease stress, to decrease pollution, to manage your time and communication better, and to avoid traffic. The reason I feel most strongly about limiting car usage is to decrease stress.

First, many people that driving can cause a lot of unneeded stress. In the first article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Heidrun Walter says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Families or even individuals exercise and get out and communicate a lot more in my opinion when they aren't riding around in a car. Traffic also causes a lot of stress.

Second, pollution is beginning to be a very big deal that can't be fixed, only stopped. The first article states that ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intencive areas in the United States."" In the second article ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer I learned that Paris enfored a patial driving ban to clear the air of the city. The smog went down by 60 percent.

To conclude, I believe that there are many advantages of limiting car usage for reasons like stress, pollution, traffic. There are many reasons that car usage should be managed and in my opinion stopped.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F1EDE809A5EE,"Cars are benefits for getting you from point A to point B, but there are many other ways you can receive transportation that way. Cars can also get you there quicker, but its not worth what we are doing to our enviornment and ourselves. There are three major advantages about limiting your car use. It will help out our enviornment with the air pollution; you can hear the peacefulness of birds and kids playing, and its a financial rest.

First and foremost, it will help out with our air pollution. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...""(14). The gas we use to fuel up our vehicles is polluting the enviornment when we use it. If we used Paris as an example, we can have odd and even driving days for odd and even license plates (11). That means only half the people with cars would be driving on the road each day which could alter the air pollution. Another reliable example is Bogota, once a year they have a car free day to limit the air pollution (20). Carlos Arturo Plaza believes, ""[i]t's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (24).

In addition, the neighborhood or city you are in wouldn't be as loud. Have you ever imagined a peaceful enviornment with no car horns or engine? Heidrun Walter said she was always tense and now she is happy without her car, because she can hear the swiss of bicycles and the chatterring of children playing (3). Rarely do I ever have peaceful moments unless I'm inside school, or at the neighborhood library. For example, a peaceful walk to school can mentally prepare me for my day ahead, and save my mother gas money.

The amount of money one pays for a car could be equilvalent to amount some else pays for their house. Also, when you get the car, you have to put gas in it for your engine to power up. Limited car use wouldn't just effect you as a person, but the economy as a whole. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport"" (9). If we reduced our car usage, the United States wouldn't have to spend 80 percent of appropriations to highways and they could even it out more to other transportation use. Plus, if you didn't have to pay for gas every week just imagine how much money that would save you.

Limited car use doesn't just effect you financially, but it also contributes positively to the enviornment. In additon, more peaceful moments can be added to your agenda of things to do. Cars are reliable for their speed and transportation, but when it comes to long term effects, I don't know if its really worth the risk.                                                                                                    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
5E09E956B0F8,"Vroom! Beep! They everywhere. Cars. People use them everyday to get back and forth to work, school, and other places needed. You may think you need them in everyday life , but their are advantages to limiting car usage in a town.

One advantage to limit car usage is that its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Cars release gasses and toxins with odors into the air that we breath. No one really wants to breath in toxins and bad air that can possibly cause heath problems .

Riding a bike can reduce air pollution . It also can take away stress and help with weight loss or burning calories if you are trying to stay healthy and fit.

Another advantage is not having to pay gas and worrying about gas prices. Money for paying for gas canadd up ove time. That money can be used towards something else important such as bills . Gas also goes back to the pollution problem. Not driving a car and having to pay for gas can reduce that problem.

And last, Limiting driving can limit traffic . No one likes to sit in traffics for hours after a long day at work or at school.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
29A8E6DA6F04,"One uses a car to go to the store, pick someone up, or even to go shopping, but what if people had no cars? Not having a car would have advantages.

To start with, not having a car helps the enviroment. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in th eUnited Stated."" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, parragraph 5). Without cars the air will become cleaner and people won't have all the polution in the air. Our air will get better if we start not having cars.

Also, another advantage is that people will get healthier. No polution gives people healthier air and with no cars people will have to walk everywhere or bike. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular swuare mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are bing adopted around the world in attempts to make the suburbs more compact and more accessible to the public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, parragraph 6). Ones destination will be a walk away not miles. People will just walk, bike, and if their destination is far away one will take public transportaion. One will become more active without cars.

Finally, driving is comming to an end. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the Untied States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortutious assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (The end of car culture, paragraph 29). Gas cost more, people are getting hurt while texting and driving, and some people just don't know how to drive. People seem to be getting over cars. This could help the enviroment. Driving just isn't a priority.

In conclusion, having no more cars would benifit people. The enviroment will be better and people are getting over cars anyways. Why drive a car that harms the air, when one could simpily walk or ride a bike making one healthier too? Not having cars would help.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

""The rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexable communting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"", This states that cellphone apps has made it possible for more people to get involved in car pooling by arrangingments such as, vans, buses, cabs, or even in a car with friends.

F6AB957AB17D,"From what I understand, people are starting to use cars less and less.

Limited car usage has been seen in many different areas of the world recently and will continue to be seen in the near future. The green house gasses released from passenger cars is a tremendous harm to the ozone layer of our Earth. If one day a year we had a ""No Car Day"" then there would be a huge impact on the ozone layers.

Now I'm not suggesting that we just get rid of cars altogether, I love driving my car around, not just to get from point A to point B, but because of the freedom. Aside from that, cars are an essential for some people, like point A to point B for example. But, people that don't need to drive on a regular basis could get rid of their car and take the bus, or carpool. So there is always another option for transportation, I like to call it AT (Alternate Transportation).

If for one day of the year we had a ""No Car Day"" the ozone impact would be positively tremendous. Then people would also realize, ""Hey, I have other ways of transportation like a bike, walking, or something else."", then there would be no problem with green house gasses guarenteed.

Now I know I haven't said a whole lot to make this sound good and all, but I do believe the percentage of people getting their drivers license is declining. My cousins in Texas feel they have no need for their license, when they always have someone to carpool them, or their parents just take them, or the city bus. Me on the other hand, I have a job, go to school, and I'm an active Boy Scout that helps with transportation on campouts throughout the year, it all depends on your circumstances on whether driving is appropriate for you.

Driving is an activity that many people do on a daily basis, but do they need to drive on that daily basis? Could they help towards a cleaner environment by finding alternate transportation? Or is a ""No Car Day"" in need? All of the above in my opinion. It all depends on your circumstance.     ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
853D4D325335,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage .

Even though cars are becoming more advanced for using as little fossil fuels and energy as possible we should try not to use them as often as we do. Cars are not as needed as we make them out to be there are a lot more types of transportation that we can choose from for example a train, a taxi, or a bicycle.

To begin with, out of all the good cars do for us they also do some harm by polluting the atmosphere and the Earth. Passenger cars are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and some areas in the United States as cited in source 1. Long term car usage causes smog which happened in the capital of France which caused car traffic to go down 60 percent which is found in source 2. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions as found in source 2.

Now that technology has advanced there's not much need to drive to places to communicate with friends and family or do other activities. You can communicate with people through all types of social media which keeps you from having to waste gas to drive to the houses of your friends or family members. Cell phones and other electronics can now be used to pay bills or any other charges that need to be paid for and keep you from leaving the house. There's many apps for car-pooling that has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements and include the evolution of shared van services for getting to work as found in source 4.

All the new types of transportation that are available now a days make it unnecessary to drive your car everywhere. In major cities there are various train stations or bus stops you can catch a ride on which helps reduce rush hour as found in source 3. Since the mid-1990s an improvement campaign began in Bogota which ended with the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths where people ride through and have a day made specifically for it which is cited in source 3. In Vauban people walk because stores are placed a walk away, or on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway as found in source 1.

To summarize it all up there's many more ways of transportation that help keep the environment safe and help limit driving for example riding a bicycle, walking, and taking a train or bus. These are only a small amount of choices and there are many more to choose from so why not limit driving cars and do one of these other choices to help the environment and ourselves.         ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

It also states that when you have a car you become more tense because of the other drivers driving around you. When you limit yourself in car and walking around it mentions you become alot happier.

Driving from place to place you tend to get caught in traffic jams and it can become very stressfull but in the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Botgota"" they say if you walk, bike, skate, or anything that doesnt involve a car, you can avoid all of the traffic.

There are different ways to getting to work or school without everyone having to use a car. In ""The end of the car culture"" it states that you could take public transportation or car pool with friends and family.

Many people forget how nice it is to walk around and enjoy the outside without any traffic or road rage on the streets.

F074E15D7250,"Many people may argue about the advantages of limited car usage. ""When i had a car, i was always tense, im much happier this way"" (Source 1). Many countries including France, Colombia, and Germany seem to have no problem with limited car usuage.

Germany is one of the greatest countries that is against low car life. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. 57 percent sold a car to move Germany. (Source 1). In total their is approximatly 5,500 residents and has a low car life because their are less space for parking.

One of the most populated city in France is Paris. Paris enforced a driving ban to clear up the polution. A 22-euro fine was given if one failed to corespond with the rules. Around 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine . After 5 days of almost car free roads (not including bus and taxis) the traffic went down by 60 percent.(Source 2). The biggest problem of the smog was Diesel fuel. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared to the rest of Western Europe that has 53.3 percent average on Diesel.

For 3 straight years, Bogota has been doing ""Day Without Cars"" that limites transportation only allowing buses and taxis. the goal for this day is to reduce smog in the capital city. Violators who failed to corespond was faced with a $25 fines. "" Millons of colombians hiked,biked,skated, or took the buses to work during this car-free day"" (Source 3). The whole family went to parks and sports centers to occupy their day. Even two others Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined in on this event.

DA2A50E507A9,"Cars nowadays are a big part of our lifes, they take us to where we need to go and help us go to far away places. Even though cars are important in our lifes, there are alot of advantages to limited car usage. Some places such as VAUBAN, Germany have given up their cars. ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park--large garages at the edge of the development, where car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" This results in less people owning or having cars and reducing green house gas emissions from tailpipes. ""Passangers cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gass emmissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (source 1). Private ownership of cars are slowly choking our cities, if we limit our car usage little by little it may have a huge effect in our ecosystem.

In continuation, there have been situations where the air pollution got so bad that they had to ban driving so they could clear the air. For example in Paris, ""after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city""(source 2). The drivers were fined a 22-euro fine if they did not leave their cars at home. In the end the smog cleared and the French party recinded the ban for odd-numbered plates. This is one of the many examples that proves that just by having less cars driving around it eventually changes the way the atmosphere looks and cleans the atmosphere a little.

Smog is a sign of high air pollution, it indicates that the air is not healthy and this can be harmful to our enviroment. ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" As indicated in the passage(source 3), ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", just one day without cars can reduce smog imagine if we go weeks without a huge number of cars driving around. This idea might sound crazy to some people but it has suprisingly helped the enviroment. This however is not the only advantage of reducing car usage. Some other advantages are that if we go to our jobs in a bike everyday or just go for a walk instead of a drive we are also being more productive and active, hence making us healthier.

Although some people might find leaving their cars behind is a bad idea, studies have shown that people who do so gets used to the idea and find less reason to resume the habit of car commuting. For example instead of driving to the beach we should ride our bikes or take public busses to get there. Without cars we learn to appreciate the beauty of nature more and notice things about the place were we live that we have never seen before. I have came to notice that when you are driving you really dont notice things because you are to busy focusing on the road, but when u have a walk around your neighborhood or anywhere for that matter you see things you have never noticed before and you leaarn to appreciate nature more. The idea of leaving our cars behind is hard for some people, but if you think about the effect it will have on the enviroment it is worth it.

In conclusion, car-free cities might sound like a joke to some people but it is helping out in clensing our enviroment increasingly. As indicated in the passage, ""The End Of Car Culture"", ""If the pattern persists--and many sociologists believe it will--it will have beneficial implications for carbon emmissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of Americas emissions, just behind power plants.""

Suburban and city residents have taken quite a lot of thought into banning driving and giving up their cars, because of the great advantages that go along with these limitations. Reducing the use of cars has amazing advantages in creating a non-polluted environment, it leads to an increase in exercise, and provides a way to save one's money.

Car reduced communities are being promoted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, aswell as all around the world. Paris, France has enforced a driving ban to reduce the intensifying pollution all over the city, as explained in the article entitled, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"". If the pattern of banning the use of cars persists, the amount of pollution will be reduced, especially in major big cities, such as Paris, London and Beijing. Continuing this cultural shift ""will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" (""The End of Car Culture""). Limiting the use of cars would highly advantage and could possibly save our environment, if we conserve our resources correctly.

Hiking, biking, skating and/or walking are all types of physical activities that are useful to get from point A to B, rather than using a car. People have began to organize their lives around how they can get to places by exercising, than commuting by car. Restaurants, shopping malls, and work offices are beginning to be located in highly populated areas and within walking range, so that the use of automobiles becomes unecessary. In Bogota, Columbia, people take a car-free day to promote alternative forms of transporation and reduce smog. Bogota ""has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" (""Car-free day is spnning into a big hit in Bogota""), in order to encourage citizens to get off the roads with their cars. Exercising has many advantages in limiting car usage, not only creating a non-polluted planet, but also creating a healthier lifestlye for a person.

As gasoline prices rise, and car insurance rates fly up, less and less people are getting a license and have stopped buying cars to save money. A study done between the years 2001 and 2009 found that driving by young people decreased by twenty-three percent, explained in the article, ""The End of Car Culture"". Leasing or owning a car is not a priority for many, as the use of taking public transportation or car-pooling is available. Without cars, people are able to save money for important life necessecities, such as food, water, and shelter, where as a car is not something needed and may be considered a luxury in other parts of the world.

Commuting is not imposibble without owning a car. With forms of exercise and public transportation, many are able to get around without spending hundreds of dollars per week on gasoline. Less driving creates a non-polluted and healthier environment, keeping our planet more stable. Eventhough owning a car seems convenient now, it may not be so convenient in the long run, as we may have to face difficulties that life throws at us. Wasting money on a car gives no advantages, where as a car-free environment is safer and more effective.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

With air pollution, smog, and greenhouse gas emissions rising all around the world, officials have announced that cars are to blame. With this, many are resorting to making changes in their communities by offering alternate means of transportation and bringing homes and stores closer together. The advantages of limiting car usage include fuel will no longer pollute the air, alternate transportation is available and cheaper, and it would enforce goodwill and communionship.

To begin, a benifit of limiting our car usage is fuel pollutes the air by circulating green house gasses that can cause a dangerous enviroment to form and by limiting cars we limit this pollution. With President Obama's issue to decrease the amount of air pollution caused by cars, many have realized that car usage is not as common as it used to be. If the number of cars on the road continues to deplete- ""and many sociologists believe it will-it will have benificial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"" (Rosenthal source 4) says Rosenthal in her article ""The End of Car Culture."" By keeping track and trying to deplete the time you spend driving your car the trend of putting air pollution to an end will increase.

Additionally, a benifit of limiting our car usage is being able to use the cheaper and more efficient alternate means of transportation. By using alternate means of transportation such as buses, trains, and car pooling services you are saving gas money and supporting community business'. There is a rise in car pooling that has ""facilitated more flexable commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" (Rosenthal source 4) says Rosenthal. As these changes manifest many people are chosing not to switch back to driving themselvs.

Finally, a benifit of limiting our car usage can be found in the better communionship that will result as cities will make their stores closer together and communities more closley knit. In Bogota, Colombia people are practicing ""car-free days"" and relying solely on public transportation. As this happens author of article ""Care-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" Andrew Selsy, says ""parks and sports centers [are] bloom[ing] throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Selsky source 3). Other places implementing car-free districts will never hear the roars of engines drowning out the chirping of the birds or childrens laughter. Infact, stores and public transportation is stratigically placed a walking distance away thus promoting social and physical benifits (Rosenthal source 1).

The advantages of limiting car usage include fuel will no longer pollute the air, alternate transportation is available and cheaper, and it would enforce goodwill and communionship. With greenhouse gasses rapidly circulating and polluting the globe it would be acceptional to decrease this by not driving as often. Furthermore, by using alternate transportation such as car pooling or taking a bus money is saved on gas and car repairs. Finally, goodwill and good social habits would increase as towns would become more closley knit as everything would only be a walk away. With this it we should limit our car usage to ""save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve saftey"" (Rosenthal source 4).

36D35B8A7915,"Here, in the United States, birthplace of the Model T,driving has proven to be part of our history and culture.  However, with recently uncovered developments in our environment such as global warming and pollution, it is time for us to re-evaluate our ""car culture"".  Overusage has proven harmful and limiting alternatives that reduce stress, are just as effective in getting us from point 'A' to 'B' and are more eco-friendly.

Our excessive car usage is dramatically hurting our environment.  In fact, ""...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (5).  What people use for our short term convenience is actually proving inconvenient for us in the long run.  In Paris, there was ""147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.9 in London"" (17).  The culprit?  Diesel fuel emissions from transportation (cars).  To underscore the severity, the smog in Paris is so bad that French Officials had to limit car usage in a smog cloaked city that ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world""(14).

This issue is mirrored in Bogota, Columbia, where the government has also stepped in and established a car free day in which perpetrators get fined in order to "" promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" (21).  Efforts such as these can be effective in aiding our environmental crisis.  After France also instated a limit on car usage ""the smog cleared"" (19).  By limiting our car usage we can actually make a difference in reducing pollution and make our living environment more pleasant and healthier.

The switch is facilitated further not only by the inclination toward a better worldy environment but a less stressful social one as well.  In the city of Vauban in Germany, residents have "" given up their cars""(1).  Here although car ownership is allowed, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move [there]."" (3).  Do the residents regret their decision?  According to Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two:  ""When I had a car I was always tense, I am much happier this way""(3).  In Bogota, a business man, Carlos Arturo Plaza who participates in Bogota's movement to reduce car usage says that the absence of cars is an ""...opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (24).  These are two individuals on different continents with families and busy lives who find the lack of cars to be not a handicap but actually a source of stress relief.  In France, after the restrictions of car usage the streets also became less stressful for people who have to drive (like taxi drivers or public transporters) because of a ""60 percent reduction in traffic congestion"" (14).

For those who do decide to make a move to help the environment and themselves by reducing their car usage, their are more and more alternatives that are making their switch worthwhile.  In Vauban, you can hear the sounds of viable alternatives in use.  The ""swish of bicycles"" and the ""chatter""(3) of walking children is audible in the streets.  Carlos Arturo Plaza rides the car-free streets of Bogota on "" atwo seat bicycle with his wife""(24).  For those who don't feel comfortable with walking or cycling other options such as carpool exist and governments are now making more of an effort to make other alternatives such easier and more available ( i. e. public transportation).  In Bogota, in order to support the movement toward less automobile driving wide sidewalks have been made.  In Vauban the whole city has been constructed with the goal to make everything compact and easier to access by foot or bike.  This is good news for those who make the early morning busness commute as their job is closer to where they live and more convenient to walk or bike to than other suburbs in which commuters are forced to take the high way because of the distance.  Also, the more people who take advantage of whatever public transportation available to them will make the demand higher and cause more funding to be placed on public transportation.  Before ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to high ways and only 20 percent to other transport""(9), but with more usage, this can change.

Essentially, the sacrifice of some of our car usage is far outweighed by the positive affects on our environment and attitudes.  Plus new systems that cater to better alternative uses make the switch easier than ever!!                           ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
64375239BDD8,"Using a car may seem helpful, but what if we limit car usage. There are many advantages in limiting car usage. Limiting car usage is becoming more common, and also reducing pollution.

Being a car free city can limit a lot of the pollution. ""Automobiles are the linchipin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes."" as stated in:

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

In Paris, after days of near-record pollution, a partial driving ban was set to clear the air of the global city. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate mattere per cubic meter, stated in:

""Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer. Cold nightws and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions, which created a smog over Paris.

Another reason for limiting car usage is because it is becoming more popular. As stated before, Vauban is a ""car-free"" suburb. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this was,"" said Heidrun Walter a media trainer in Vauban. In Bogota, Colombia; for the third straight year cars, have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, stated in:

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky.

""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said the Bogota Mayor.

The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal says: ""...recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year go by."" This indicates that a new era is coming. Limiting car use has already taken action because of the dangers of pollution, making limiting car more popular everywhere. Cities already participating, are an example to others of how useful this act can be.

Although limiting cars is already taking place, it is not worldwide. Only a few cities have begun to do it. There are advantages, seeing the cities that participate in a ""car-free"" society and realizing that the results are not bad should be a wake up call to others. After all, doing so helps save the planet a little more; and with a bit more help, limiting car usage will be worldwide.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
9B23715DFB32,"if we look back at time in the united states young people were thrilled to be able to drive. but in more recent years studies show that the young in the united states dont really have the same thrill anymore actually there really not interested at all they find alternative ways to get to were there going like public transportation carpooling biking or just good old walking and really its not a bad idea at all if we can get others in the US to limiting the use if there cars it could do the world a lotta good

If you take a look at Colombia for instience they have a day where in bogota 7 million people are banned using there cars for a day they find alternatives to get around like biking hiking walking busses and taxi cabs doing this is a good way to stop air polluion and also to promote alternatives transportation and if people violate it theres a fine of $25 a bussiness man by the name of Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution""

in Germany theres one suburb that carry on's with lives without cars street parking driveways and home garages are grenrally forbidden Vaubans streets are completly car free except the main thoroughfare where theres a tram that takes them downtown in this expermintal upscale town on the outskirts of freiburg car ownership is actually allowed but theres only 2 places to park there are large garages at the edge of the development where a car onwer buys a space for $40,000 along with a home due to the outrageous price 70 percent of the families that live in Vauban dont own cars and 57 percent sold there cars to move Vauban in clousion i think if we could all take a page from everybodys book i truely think we could spread awareness and maybe cut down or even get rid of most of the air polution not just in the united states or columbia or in germany...but get rid of air pollution in the whole intire world

In German Susburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , writen by Elisabeth Rosental, She tells her readers that a suburb in Germany, Vauban, has street parking, driveways, and home garages generally forbidden. Rosenthal states that not having a car can actually bring happiness. ""'When I had a car I was always tence. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walker.""

In the second article,

Paris bans dring do to smog , by Robert duffer, he tells the reader about the struggles Paris faced with polution in the air. He states that they made a system where one day they would have even licence plate number stay home one day and the odds would stay home the next. After trial and error, They came up with a solution, And it helped the smog go away. If cars were banned completly the air we breathe would be so much cleaner, and less foggy. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescrind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.""

In the third passage

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , by Andrew Selsky, It talks about a car free day that takes place once a year in the town on Bogota. The passage also states that people hiked, biked, skated, and took buses to work during the car free day. Selsky states that the goal of the day is to promote alternative transportation and reduse smog, Which brings back the fact that not using cars reduses polution in the ait. The other reson banning cars is a good idea is because it redused stess, because you dont have to deal with traffic, find a parking spot, or worry about being late to work because you have to stop to fill up your tank in the morning. ""'It's a good oppotunity to take away stress...' said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza""

The last article the End of Care Culture , written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, talks about how ""americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". i beleive people are finally coming to the state of mind where public transportation is the faster, easier, and more afisiant way. Another reason it is better than having your own cars is that it is safer. ""'...public transpotation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resousrces, lower emissions and improve safety.""

Cars are one of the leading causes of pollution in the world. They are also very expensive to own and operate. By limiting car usage, you could cut down and costs and protect the environment.

By not using cars, it could drastically improve the environment. In Paris they banned driving because of smog, and now they have no smog and a much cleaner city. If driving limits were placed everywhere, then this could happen worldwide.

Everyone knows that cars are very expensive, to buy one knew can set you back tens of thousands of dollars. And then a few years down the road it breaks down, to fix it can costs you thousands. Not to mention inssurance and gas. Just imagine how much money you could have if you didnt ever have a car. You could practically buy a house with the savings. That could happen to everyone if we limited the use of cars.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car use such as saving the environment and saving money. We need to follow Paris's example and cut out car usage in cities to create a healthier world.                         ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

People are starting to realize that their happier when not riding their car, in fact Heudrun Walter mother of 2 said ""when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walter now can walk the streets and enjoy the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children.

Us humans rely to much on our cars for transportation, We should learn how to get to places on our own. Before we had cars we walked on our own 2 feet and didnt complain, its time for us to get back part of our humanity. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"",said David Goldenberg, an official of Transportation for America. If cars were to all of a sudden disappear would you be capable of getting around without a vechicle of transportation?

In Bogota, Colombia a program was set to have a car free day. The only way of transportation was through buses and taxis, and violators would have to pay a $25 fine. ""It was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower pollution"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Not only does not riding your car lower pollution but it can also help lower emissions, conserve resources, and improve safety. The goal is to limit car usage and to start noticing the advantages of a car free life, like walking the streets and enjoying another beautiful day.

Fellow citizens I advice you to put down you car keys and go outside to smell the clean air, see the sun shining on your face and get a breeze of how life would be from outside the windows of your car.

6ED31611B5C4,"Many people in the world today think that cars and driving everywhere is a necessity; however, many people feel that owning a car is ""impractical (and) undesirabe."" (paragraph 43) There are many advantages to having cars, but there are also many more advantages to not using cars wherever people go. Some advatages include conserving resources, making people have a little more money in their pocket and it also improves safety in many suburban cities.

In the world today, a major problem that still exsists is greenhouse gases. Cars emit a lot of gas that isn't good for the enviroment. In the first source, it says that people living in cities ""is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes... passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent...in Europe...and up to 50 percent... in the United States.""(paragraph 5) Exports mean to say that it is better for people to live in cities so they don't have to drive everywhere. This means that the more people that live in cities, the less gas goes into the air. In Paris, the city issued a ban for driving to try and reduce the smog. The second source says that ""congestion was down to 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" (paragraph 14) Only after five days of the no driving ban, more than half of the smog was gone in Paris. It also says that the amount of smog was almost as polluted at the city of Beijing, China, which is the most polluted city in the world. Bogota also did the same thing. They have an event called ""A Day Without Cars."" Participant Carlos Arturo Plaza says it is a good way ""to take away stress and lower air pollution.""(paragraph 24) They also got other cities, and even other countries, to follow suit and join the event. America faces the same problem as Paris; too many greenhouse gases are being put into the atmosphere. President Obama has a goal that he wasnts to achieve and  that is to try and make the enviroment healthy. The last article says that driving less ""will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.""(paragraph 34) This implies that the amount of gases let into the air will be reduced. If peolpe didn't drive as much from place to place, the world would be a happier, healthier place.

Apart from the fact that cars give of gas, not driving everwhere also means people save more money. In Vauban, Germany, nobody has any cars, they walk or bike to wherever they need to go. ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the egde of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.""(paragraph 2) People would be more inclined to not getting a car rather than spend an extra 40 grand on top of getting a house for a parking space. Also, in Paris, a fine was issued for people who drove their cars during the car ban. The second article says ""even-number license plastes were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine..""(paragraph 11) If people didn't drive their cars around when they weren't supposed to, they would still have the 22 euros they lost. The same type of fine was issued in Bogota, Columbia. If people drove their cars on ""A Day Without Cars"", then they would have to face a $25 fine. However, in the United States, ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""(paragraph 29) Without having to pay for a car or gas money, Americans are saving way more money they had been when they first got a car. Wit people not having to worry about payments or gas prices, they have more money in their wallet.

Not only does not driving save money and reduce gas, it also improves cities and people's lives. Heidrun Walter, a German media trainer, says that ""when (she) had a car, (she) was always tense. (She's) much happier this way."" (paragraph 3) She likes not having to drive everywhere, it makes her feel more calm and less tense. It's not only changing peoples lives, but it's changing the cities. Cities are attempting ""to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with eless space for parking.""(paragraph 6) Cities are changing their apperance in order to intice people into driving less and walking or biking more. They intend to make the stores closer together rather than having to drive across the highway to get to the next store. Also in Bogota, there has been a ""cunstruction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" and ""parks and sports centers...have bloomed throughout the city.""(paragraphs 27&28) With more people walking, the city wants to make the outside apperance different and more appealing than what it looked like before people just used cars. Not driving is not only good for personal well being, but for the a city's well being.

There are many advantages to driving cars, such as saving time and getting to places faster but, not driving cars is way better in the long run because of a better enviroment, saving money and better cities and personal health.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E5EBC1FAE3BA,"In society today transportation is neccessary to keep most things going. Cars are one of the biggest transportation devices used. The advantages of limiting car usage range from taking away stress to lowering air pollution.

Stress is one of the biggest factors faced while driving. Continuously having to check for cars around you, looking for open spaces to race by the car infront of you, and waiting in those horrible traffic jams that waiste useful time in your life. Reducing the amount of car usage will lead to exercise which reduces stress and less waiting time for multiple things. As stated in source 1, paragraph 3 a resident of Vauban says ""When I had a car I was always tense."" Mentally driving is a lot to handle and always has you worried no matter how comfortable your car is.

A really big problem in our environment today is air pollution. Reduced car usage leads to less gas having to be drilled from oil mines and places underground. It also comes with a bundle of less smog and a stronger, cleaner, atmosphere. Even a businessman in Columbia commented ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" in source 3 paragraph 24 as he participated in the annual car-free day. The better the environment and air pollution the healthier the oxygen.

95E4058CC026,"In the following ideas and information passage set we see the effects of using cars too much and how limiting our car use can have a huge impact on, not only our environment, but also on cities on people. Limiting our car usage isn't only a thing that the United States has to work on, but we see that Central America and Europe also has to work on it. Limiting our car usage isn't a small issue, but more of a global issue. Over the years we have seen the effects of global warming (something cause by fossil fuels, which is gas coming from our cars) and how they have had an enormous impact on our world. So, why is liming our car usage even remotely important to us?

In the second article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", paragraph 10, the first thing it says is ""After days of near-record pollution.."", well, what does this say about how we're living today? Paris so close to to being on record breaking pollution, not that it's anything to be proud of. But, if that's how much pollution Paris has, which is a famous city for not only being the ""City of Love"", but for also being big, how will every other city's pollution be? Cities have been growing and expanding so much recently, factories are being built and more cars are being sold, how will this help limiting our car usage? If cities keep expanding, we'll just be adding to the pollution that already exists. After a couple decades all the issues we seem to be ignoring will come up and if the problems are bad now, how bad will they be in the future? This isn't just something we can ignore!

Like David Goldberg says in paragraph seven in ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car.."". Why have we been focusing more on a car than on health and medicine and cures for some illnesses? Why is a car so important? Yes it makes going to places much more easier and quicker, but at what cost will we go to to make things easier on us? It isn't jsut about the pollution caused from our cr usage, but it's also about our health. There are fewer and fewer parks by the year because we'd rather have all our tax money go towards roads instead parks. More malls are opening up and more fast food places are opening up on big interstates and highways, and now all we really have to being close to nature is when we pass by the trees near the interstates and highways. We need trees in order to have oxygen, but if all this pollution is slowly killing trees, how much more time do we have left before we realize it's too late to try saving our trees and limiting our car usage? Back then no one really worried much about limiting our car usage and pollution, because it wasn't that bad. Now all you ever really hear is about pollution and how to stop it.

Even though we really have got to start limiting our car usage, there is still hope in lowering and or even stopping pollution. We could start off small, for instance, by having a day where no one is allowed to drive their cars to places or be fined if you do drive, like Bogota, Colombia does in ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". It must've had a positive effect because it encouraged Cali and Valledupar, two other Colombian cities, to participate in the event as well.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E9E78F65AF52,"To limit car usage, can bring some positive impacts to our world. Many countries such as Germany or France are adopting this act to better their community. Some benefits are the reduction of traffic, a smaller chance of car crashes and injuries, reduction of polution and appreciating whats around you already instead of being couped up in a car. People now are replacing driving with riding bikes, hiking or walking to where they want to get to or just car pooling with a friend.

In Germany, Heidrun Walter (media trainer and mother of two) says ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" She walks the verdant streets where you can here the passing of bicycles and chatter of the children hanging around and roaming the streets. To ensure that there is a reduction in car usage in the Vauban streets of Germany, drivways and home garages are considered forbidden. If you wish to own a car you'd need to by a large garage and the edge of the development where you buy a space for $40,000, along with a home.

In Paris, France, they enforced a partial driving ban to cleanse the air of the city. Motorist with an even numbered licenced plate were told to laeve their cars at home or they'd have to pay a $31 fine, also with even numbered plates. After this was done, the congestion went down 60 percent, after 5 days of smog in the air. The reasons why France did this was because they blamed the amount of gasoline coming from the cars. The smog got out of control so they decided to limit car usage.

In America, the reduction of car usage is also going down. People are depending more on biking, or walking to their designation or catching a ride with a friend. New york has a new bike sharing program along with bridge and tunnel tolls which refelct those new priorities. In source 4, the author and another citizen have similar traits with their children and cars. Mr. Sivak's son owns a car but prefers to take the Bay Area Rapid Transit.  The authors chidlren didnt bother getting a drivers license even though they live in places where they should have one. They dont think having a car is a necesity. They'd rather stick with their jobs, take public transportaions and just walk or car pool to where ever they please to have their social life.  Limiting car usage has many more beneficial ways to communities, and it is being adopted in numerous places.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
3AC97712BBFA,"While cars have made our lives so much simpler in the aspect of transporting ourselves efficiently, there are a few drawbacks. Some cities have made efforts to reduce these drawbacks. Limiting car usage cuts down on pollution and saves money but makes transportation less efficient.

Limiting car usage cuts down on pollution. An example of this is in Paris when they had a smog problem, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Paris had a smog problem, and limiting car usage prved to be an effective solution. Another example of limiting car usage cutting down on pollution is in Bogota, Colombia. They had a car-free day to reduce smog. ""cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million."" Colombia has a day without cars to cut down on air pollution. This has beed proven to be an effective solution to smog.

75EB288E2375,"The articles explain that the limited use of cars or automobiles is to our advantage. Two reasons that support this theory is that one you won't have to stress about buying a car and making sure everyone has one, and second you will help to protect the environment from the harmful gases of automobiles.

The limitation on cars may have its advanatges because, among the billions of people on this earth many of them own cars. Many vehicles give off harmful pollution gases to the environment and can cause many endangering problems to people as well. Evidence from source 2: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" can support the following... ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a parial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This evidnce supports the fact that there was enough smog in the air that led to the prohibition of cars for a limited time. This is to the people's advantage because they were now able to breathe fresh air instead of smog. Another piece of evidence also comes from source 2: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensyfying smog...[The smog] rivaled with Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" This evidence shows that smog causes pollution which is harmful in many ways. It also shows just how much of a difference just five days of limitation on vehicles can help reduce pollution. So the sooner people can see what banning cars can do to their health and well-being then maybe they will see what the love and cherish so much, can actually be hurting them.

Car limitations may be the best thing yet for America and other places in the world. By banning cars we could reduce a lot of stress and the worry about the payments and supplying the vehicle with gas. Evidence that can support this comes from source 4: "" The End of Car Culture""  ""the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995....recession, because cash strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway."" This explains that many Americans cannot even afford cars. So they go about their days just fine taking public transportation or receivin rides from friends. So by banning cars we could actually reduce the stress of not having a car or making the payments on them... plus we would have better health. Out of the estimated 7 billion people on this earth, it is not guranteed that all of them around the ages of 15 and above are equipped with a a vehicel of their own. Evidence from Source 4: ""The End of Car Culture"" can support the following "" What most intrigues me is the rates of car ownership per househols and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" Thi just goes to show you that not only are cars bad for the enviornment and people's health but, they are bad financially for people to maintain and keep up. The automobile is what changed America back in the day. But it is causing some damae to us now.

Car limitations have some advanatges that are probably very beneifcial to us. We may think that cars are our only way of transportaion and that you need them to survive but, that is not necessarily true. Cars are great but up to a certain extent.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Therefore, if we all used our cars less, it will benifit our health, benifit our financial problems, and benifit our environment.

Duffer and Rosenthal tells us about how using less cars will benifit our health. It would make us healthier by cleaning the up the pollution and smog in the air. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog.."" (14) This is saying that people in France were becoming significantly healthier in just 5 days without the use of cars. Not only only does it make you less sick, but it reduces stress. It reduces stress because you dont have to worry about maintaining a car. ""When i had a care i was always tense. im much happier this way"" (3) This is saying that its less stressful not having car, and makes people happier. Health is a primary factor in our lifes and taking cars away puts us in a better position.

Rosenthal and Selsky tell us about how using less cars will benifit our financial problems. It would make us more money because they are not spending so much on gas, and components to keep the car in condition to drive. ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (29) This is saying that people are not on the road alot, and if people arent on the road alot, they are not spending money. Not only does it save money on cars, but it helps you use other ways to get to places that arent expensive. It isnt expensive because people can find alternatives that dont need gas, and so much maintance. ""In a program that's set to spread to other countires, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday.."" (20) This is saying that because they dont need to use cars and there are differerent routes to take, the need to spend money on transportation decreases. Money is important to gets the necessities we humans need, so saving is a big deal.

Rosenthal and Selsky tells us about how using less cars will benifit our environment. It would better the environment because people will learn to communicate better. ""Likewise the rise in cell phones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of share can services for getting to work."" (35) This is saying that people learn how to share and to help one another out. Not only does it help communication, but it also helps helps people get outside and be active. It helps people get active because is they dont have cars, they have to keep themselves occupied or if they want to get to places, they have to walk, bike, etc. ""Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.."" (28) This is saying that that the city is working with the people to help make the environment a better place with no cars. The environment is an important factor as well because we have to take care of the place we live in.

In conclusion, Rosenthal, Selsky, and Duffer have shown that the reduction of the usage of cars will help us tremendously, and that having a healthier life, a greater amount of money, and a better environment will change the world.                            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Another advantage woulod be that with less cars running around the streets would be way satfier. With generation being that more kids are starting to drive everyone esle is more at risk with there satfy. ""different things are convering which suggest thta we are witnessing a long-term cultral shift"" mean that we can still feel connected to other peolpe without driving.  So we dont need to be driving around all the time it would be in all of are best interst to limit driving cars.

in conclusion i feel that limiting driveeing would help all of us in the long run into liveing in a better an safer wold. Tat if we take care of will keep us safe by living here.                           ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
620BD8D96D0B,"Around the world, cars are being used every day to get to place to place. Cars are useful things that get us to places faster than public transportation, walking, biking, etc. But it doesnt seem to be worth all the things its causing. Pollution and smog carpet over cities because of all the car usage in such a small area. Sure cars are useful to going somewhere 20 or so miles away when there is no bus to bring you there, but do we really need them to go half a mile to get to work?

Many places have tried to reduce car usage, some even have special days where the complete ban them from being used. In Bogota, Colombia, for three straight years have had a day called ""Day withough Cars"". Only buses and taxis were permitted to drive on the roads on this day and anyone who decided to drive on their own, recived a $25 fine. Even when the rain came down, people didn't stop participating. Seeing the results, Colombian cites, Cali and Valledupar, also joined this event.

Some cites have big problems with smog and pollution from cars alone. After days of near-record pollution, Paris decided that it would be best to give the air some time to clear up. They enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air and it seemed to help. The ban was to decrease cars on the road by half, on Monday, drivers with odd-numbered license plates were allowed on the roads and the evens were told to leave their cars at home. The next day, the roles were switched and even though almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 72 people had their cars inpounded for the reactions to the fine, it helped.

In Vauban, Germany, They do allow cars, but it only has two parking spaces; large garages and at the edge of the development, which costs $40,000, along with a home. This place is an experimental district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near French and Swiss borders. 70 percent of the families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. Citizens seem to be much more happy with the no car zone and seem to enjoy walking and biking from place to place. Vauban, along with its 5,500 residents, are the part of a trend in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere to seperate suburban from cars as a component of a movement called ""smart planning"".

Many countries and cities are trying to help reduce the use of cars and are doing as much as they can to help out with the pollution and smog. This is an important step to helping our enviorment and conserving the resouces we need to better our lives. This doesn't mean getting rid of cars completely, carpooling and more conservative driving would help a lot as well. Limiting car usage is something we all need to do to live a better life and help our world.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

To have a home in Vauben, Germany, you have to give up your own car to own a house in that area. Till this day, Vauban, Germany have still hade the rule to not have cars in that area. People nowadays want towns like Levittown and Scarsdale which is located in New York.

Paris is another city who had banned cars for a period of time. Due to smog Paris needed to limit the use of cars and only use buses and taxis for transportation. If you broke the law and useed your car, you had to pay a fine off 22 euros ($31). Paris and Beijing, China were neck at neck with the worlds most polluted cities. This was a difficult time during the east coast of thr world.

In Bogota, Colombia during a car-free day people would skate, take buses, biked , hiked, etc. Peolpe who violated this rule would have to pay a $25 fine. Bogota only did that to reduce pollution and smog from the air. The majority of the people did not care abou t not taking cars as transportation. They enjoyed going outside to walk to places and to enjoy the weather even if it was cloudy or raining.

The United States is trying to be more efficiant and trying not to use cars as much. People who are being ""green"" use the diesel gas to fill up there car. They also love to car pull people. Some of them do not even use cars to transport themselves to other places, some use horses, skateboarding, biking, etc.                      ",1,Car-free cities,Text dependent
96B1B69CB61B,"Throughout the passages the limiting car usage is critical, our community are giving up their cars. due to Suburb, smog, and car free day. The United States, with it's broad expanses and suburan ideals, had long been one of the world's prime car cultures. American's are buying fewer cars, driving less, and not following inforcement laws.

In Germany, Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, or communiting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars. Therefore, Street parking and driveways are forbidden on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. causing residents to react differenly. Passengers cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive area in the United States. Basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to produce suburbs more compact and more accessible to pubilc transportation with less parking space. Also, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"". Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role.

For Instance, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city. Because, traffic was down 60 percent in the capital of France it created smog. Since, Diesel fuel was blamed France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. While, Delivery companies complained of lost revenue while exceptions were made, and cars carrying three more passengers.

In Other Words, in a program located in Colombia that's spread to other countries millons hiked, biked. or took buses to work during a car-free day leaving the streets of this capital city devoid of traffic jams. the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. In different too, President Obama's goals to curb the United State's greenhouse gas. recent studies produce that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. As of, part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, Americans can't afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work. The limiting car usage has big a big problem around the world and people's reactions are critical, the factors of the the car limiting usuage are smog, suburb, and car cultures.

05BFF181A3AA,"NO MOTORVEHICLES? Yeah I know sounds crazy but it is actually very true and very helpful to our ""Mother Nature"". Around the world there have been an ample amount of experiments and even permanent instances that show off the marvelous wonders of no motor vehicles. From the alps of Vauban, Germany to down the street in Paris, France to even meet the other side of the world in Bogota, Colombia. Where there have been complete motor vehicle banning even going to the extreme of redesigning the whole city just to fit there suburban type customs but without the vehicles. Even just a simple banning for two days on motor vehicles just to clean up the air from time to time. As well as having a yearly event where all motor vehicles except for buses and taxis are banned all day long.

In Vauban, Germany they host home to about 5,500 residents within a rectangular mile. With absolutely no motor vehicles, they are forbidden. I think its actually pretty nice to have a suburban town where the whole town doesnt even have room for motor vehicles. Roads, street parking, parking lots, driveways, and home garages all do not exist in this town. They take it to the extreme where as to live in the town if you own a motorvehicle you MUST sell your motor vehicle first. 70 perecent of families do not own cars and 57 perecent sold a car to move into Vauban. And if you are to own a car you must purchase your own car space at the very edge of the city wich cost up to $40,000, along with the price of your home. Alot of people around the world support this even here in the United States the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and legislators are begining to act.

After Paris came to a near record pollution level they enforced a parial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. One Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were demanded to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine or the the equivalant of $31. The same would apply to the odd numbered plated that following tuesday. Near 4,000 drivers were fined according to a international news agency headquatred in London. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals with  147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels, and 79.7 in London. There smog rate was so bad they rivaled the city of Beijing, China which is known as the most polluted city in the world. The congestion in was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five-days of incredibly increasing smog. But with the ban the smog cleared up enough Monday for the ruiling french party to rescind the ban for the odd numbered plates by Tuesday.

It was the third consecutive year that motor vehicles besides buses and taxis were baned from the capital of Bogota, Colombia. But this third year other major cities like Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. This day is specifically without cars is part of an improvement campain that began in Bogota in the mid-1990's as an improvement campain. And it has worked it has cleaned up the environment in all three cities. Parks and sport centers have also blosssomed throughout the city. Unequal, jagged sidewalks have been replaced by smooth sidewalks and rush hour has dramatically cut traffic out of the picture while restaurants and upscale shopping districts have been on the rise.

111D1D7C0A67,"Imagine this you're in a very populated city. Lets say New York, New York, U.S.A, London, England or any densily populated  city for that matter. Now aside from the sounds of car horns blairing and the sounds of the thousands of people around you there is one thing that would most likely stand out the most to people; the smell of car emissions mixed with the food street venders sell. Now they may not be a huge surprise but think about this, a city or suburb without cars. Now some may say that limiting the use of cars is a terrible idea and would hurt the working call citizens, but it may be better then you think. The reasons why these ""car-free"" places might not be so bad is it helps reduse the growing percent of greenhouse gas emissions that cars give off. You wouldn't have to deal with smog, and there wouldn't be as much noise pollution as there is with cars. Yeah these points may not seem like they are worth not having a car but there are comminties that actully don't allow cars because of those reasons. So maybe after this you may think a little differently about your car and may think about moving to one of these places that have alread choosen to go ""car-free"".

First off, probably like most people around the world you love your car, bt do you ever think about the car emission you admit into the air just driving to worl and back home. Now that does seem bad but, as shown in paragraph 5 of,

""In German Suburb, Life Goeson Without Cars"", an essay by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she writes that experts say the passsenger cars alone are reponsible for about 12 percent in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the U.S for greenhouse gas emissions. Now 12 percent doesnt seem like a lot compared to the 50 percent but that is still a lot of greehouse gases getting put in our atmosphere year after year.

Now think about this idea of a ""car-free"" suburb or city again. An example of this kin of place would be the city of Vauban, Germany. Now in Vauban drive ways and home garages are forbidden; now car ownership is allowed but there are about two places to park. Now that place to park is a large garagw at the edge of the developement where as well as buying your house you have to buy a parking space for $40,000. Now because of this 70 percent of the families don't have cars and 57 percent of them sold their car to move there. Since there aren't car used here the air is much cleaner and because of not having little to no cars there they don't pollute the air.

Secondly, another reason to think about moving to one of the places is that there isn't any noise pollution from cars. Beause of the lack of car noiseses these suburbs and cites let you hear nature a little better and also allow a kind of peaceful feeling making these p;aces probably a lot more chill and ""sleepy"" in a since. making them good for people who don't want to live in a noisy city but don't want to live in the middle of no where.

Lastly, another good reason to move to these little areas would be that there is no smog there to make it harder to breath. A real world example of this would be from the informative essay, ""

Paris bans driving due to smog""

, by Robert Duffer. Which basically states that due to near-record pollution Paris put a ban on driving to try and clear the air in the city. Now to help inforce the ban the put a 22-euro fine($31) if you where driving on a day your licsens plate was not allowed to drive. Now because some people did follow the ban nearly 4,000 people were fined and 27 people had cars impounded because of the reaction to the fine. Now because of this some companies complained about lost renvenue and the transit of free of charge according to the BBC. And because of these efforts the smog cleared enought that the ban was lifted. Now that probably isn't very convinet but in car-free areas they don't have to deal with making it eariser to get to work on more accessible public transportation options like a bus or a bicycle.

Now think about this idea about car-free places one more time knowing what the benifits are compared to the risks you get. Maybe noe you just might look at these places a little more carefully and acually think about making a switch to live there in this greenhouse gas free, noise free, and smog free zone.                                                                            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
6290D536F834,"In the old world, people didnt have car's, they did everything on foot. They got food, ran erronds, and just to get out of the house with the family. So how come now adays people are so dependent on their car's. Places around the world are implimenting rules or laws now to stop people from abusing the car.

Since the car was invented it has always had the same issue, not the engine or the interior, but the environmental issue. And now that people around the world are realizing that, they have created rules and laws to ban or reduce the usage of cars. A community in Germany called Vauban have given up their car's to help the environment, and people love it. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two.

Paris ""The Love City"" in France has Banned cars because of the high amount of smog it creates. After the law was placed, only after five days, congestion was down 60 percent.

Paris has the most smog compared to any other European captials, they had to do this or the smog would take over the city. And since the ban has been posted, smog has been clearing and is now much more limited in the area.

Major cities like New York were built in a narrow way, so its more congested when too many people are driving, and the buildings are much closer together so its more convinent to walk or bike to places rather than drive. New York has implimented a new bike-sharing program, and it is a hit. And around the nation a similar program is the car-sharing program. It encourages people about car pulling, it is when multiple people go to work or school in the same car, it puts less cars on the road and has plentiful benifits. Like less carbon dioxide in the air, less traffic, and saves on gas money.

Bill Ford, an exeuctive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, pitched a plan to live in a world that owning a personal car was impractical. He proposed to partnering with telecommunications industy to make a city or many where the ""pedestions, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety.""

Banning cars around the world isn't a solution because they are more convinent than taking a train or walking, but their needs to be a cut down on the amount we use a car, we abuse it. Eventually all the greenhouse gases might end up destroying the planet we live on. But their are solutions, implementing a world day were we dont use cars would help tremendusly, their are other means of getting around other than car. For example Biking is a great form of excersice and will get you to were you need to be faster than walking, while getting in shape at the same time.                                            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In Vauban, Germany is an experimental district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss border. Unlike the Marion County there are very few, or no cars, which means no accidents, no stress, and no money wasted on gas. Some of Vauban's citizens have said ""When i had a car i was always tense, I am much happier this way."" What if our communities were like that? Do you think morale would be higher and that people would be more laid back? Every day on the news theres a story about car pileups, and accidents on the highway and blockage on roads. The Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""Car reduced communities"" and legislators are starting to act on it. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a big role in the country soon, Says Elisabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times.

Paris, France one of capitals of the worlds most polluted cities enforces a partial driving ban to help clear the air of the city. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter compared to 114 in Brussels and 79 in London. On mondays motorists with even numbered license pklates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd numbered plates on the next day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined on the first day and 27 cars were impounded due to the reaction of the drivers. Some say thats easier to imagine than a car free community, but is it truly easier on the people? People blame diesel fuel because France has a tax policy that favors diesel over regualar leaded gasoline, and due to that diesels make up 67% of the vehicles in the country.

In Bogota, Colombia there is a car free day every year, where Colombians, hiked, biked, skated or took buses to get around. It was the third year of the event and the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog and pollution. The turnout was very large, despite gray clouds that dumped occational rain on the participators. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower pollution"", and for the first time two other cities joined in on the day, the cities were ""Cali, and, Valledupar"".

Limiting your car usage is very important, you could save the world and it's pretty efficient.

To begin, the earth is filled with pollution, but scientist have been trying to find a solution and I think we just found it. In ""German suburb, life goes on without cars"" Elisabeth Rosenthal writes about a small upscale community called Vauban, Germany where the residents are suburban pioneers. What made them pioneers was that they had given up their cars. Places like Vauban are becoming a trend in Europe, the U.S, and elsewhere to seperate subrban life from auto use as a component of a movement stated in the text as ""Smart Planning.""

This idea to solve the worlds pollution problem is working.

Furthermore, this idea is also efficient. The idea need you to reduce your car usage and revert to other methods of travel, like bikes, skateboards, and public transportation. For example in ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" Andrew Selsky writes ""millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" this event has going on for a while it's creating a revolution. This event has ""seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths."" What about America? Well recent studies suggest thet Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by as stated in another Elisabeth Rosenthal article ""The end of car culture"". Also the article says ""If the pattern persists...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Only the future will tell where this solution is headed.

In conclusion to, the fact that an idea like this has been around for years and the amount of progress it has is amazing. The polution and green house problems are going out the window and were to blame for it.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
5A94F91C9AA4,"In the modern world, we are almost completely dependent on our technology to get us through the day.  These human creations, such as, cellular phones, the internet, computers, and cars make it easier for us to perform everyday tasks.  But for such heavy use of these items, there are side effects.  Cars in particular can, and will, create lasting issues in our environment, which if not resolved will cause many problems in our future.  But there is hope; if the First World states like the UK, France, Germany, and the U.S. were to cut down on car usage, we would see a drastic decline in not only the air polluting greenhouse gases, but also expenses for families spending all their money at a gas pump.  Furthermore, we would see an increase in other things, such as the amount of exercise and public people would acquire through alternative transportation.

The foremost issue is of course, the environmental effects of cars.  According to the New York times, cars are on average responsible for ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas"".  These emissions can often make cities uninhabitable.  In places such as Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other urban centers; heavy pollution requires citizens to wear gas masks, and acid rain devstates plant life.  This heavy pollution has such an effect that it causes black snow in Russia, thousands of miles away.  But the scale of the problem is much larger than acid rains and black snow; our planet is heating up, and greenhouse gases are to blame.  If you want evidence just look at our neighbor, Venus.  Roughly the size of Earth, scientists believe that Venus once has water, but look at it today, and you will see our solar system's hottest planet.  Several million years ago Venus was overcome by volcanic activity; of much greater extent than anything ever seen on Earth since it's formation in pre-cambrian time.  These volcanos spewed thousands of tons of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere, and thus began the greenhouse effect.  The sun's rays would pierce through the smog and reflect off of the surface of the planet, but when they went back up the smog stopped them and turned them away, back down towards the planet's surface.  This caused the planet to practically absorb all of the energy and heat of the sun.  Before long the surface temperature became hot enough to melt lead, making Venus utterly uninhabitable.  If nothing is done to stop atmospheric pollution, this is our future.

But in our modern world many people would be completely lost without a car, it has become the staple of our infastructure, not unlike the horse from years past.  But there is evidence in the small town of Vauban, Germany; that life without cars is a very possible thing.  The small community of Vauban has forbidden cars within their town, and the results are suprisingly positive.  Of the residents of Vauban, seventy percent do not own cars, and are very happy with their circumstances.  As Heidrun Walter said to the New York Times, ""When I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way.""  While other states might not have such successful car free zone's, Colombia has an annual car-free day in their capital of Bogota and surrounding cities.  This day often has millions of Colombians biking, and walking from place to place.  There has also been an improvement in city beautification according to an article by the Seattle Times, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks . . . and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""  Not only does the restriction of cars help the environment, it can also help the economy.

The average American citizen's budget consists mainly of two things, housing, and vehicles.  But during the recession of 2008, there was a decline of about nine percent in average miles driven.  The burden of gas prices and car payments became too much for many unemployed Americans.  But after the recession passed, the decline continued, and may soon accelerate.  The New York Time states that ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate.  There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age"".  If this trend continues, then we have already taken the first step in curbing our greenhouse gas emissions; and by doing so, we may increase the living standards of our citizens who would have more money.  As well as repurposed government funding in other cleaner and faster forms of transportation due to a lesser need in road construction and maintainance.

Finally, the world we live in today is changing, and with always increasing technology, it may not be long before a clean alternative to gas burning vehicles arises.  But you cannot count on the unknown; and what is known is that should we continue on our current path, the world will be a very hot place by 2040.  Either we must change, or our cars will die with us.

Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city, sidewalkes have been replaced by smooth sidewalks, and new resturants ans shopping districts have cropped up.

The United States had long been one of the world's prime car cultures. It's the birthplace of many cars. But America's love of vehicles has been cooling. The number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped thereafter. At the Mobile World Congress they stated that 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars,commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Driving has decreased over the years. Not having a car does not stop you from meeting your friends either. There is the internet, cellphones, car pulling apps which has made shared van services more popular.

To conclude, not having a car wouldn't be such a bad thing. Many people would aslo agree to this. In Columbia they have a car free day, in Vauban, Germany nobody drives there. Also in the united States their is a lower presentage rate of people buying cars and getting their license. People are happier without a car and that says alot about how stressful having a car might be. Not owning a car might be more safe for your everyday life.

car liscense ownership rates have only decreased since 2005. this means we are putting out less emissions than 12 years ago! we are eqaul to where the country was in 1995. the reasons vary as to why lisence ownsership is decreasing but so far it has its advantages. People are car pooling more and using bikes and walking to their destination. the only negative side of limited car usauge is for the car industry. with less cars on the road, they get less money. But overall people will benifit from this.

Limiting car usage has huge advantages and I encourage you to try walking or biking rather than using your car. You will become more socail, fit, and help prevent pollution.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
CB8523849A13,"A world without cars is kind of hard to imagine right? Well not for most countreis anymore. Cars are becoming less and less desirable as the years go on. The peak was in 2005 and then has been slowly decreasing. Younger people like the ideas of cars but don't really need one. New York has subways, taxi's, and others are carpooling to  destinations. France has alreayd issued a ban on cars and has even had certain cars banned on certain days. For instance, even number car plates could not be used for driving on Monday's, odd number plates were banned for Tuesday's. This was to help reduce the amount of smog in the French air as they rely mostly on diesel rather than gas. In Vauban, Germany street parking, driveways and home garages have been banned from neighborhoods. You could now only buy a house with a garage for $40,000. This cause more people to stop using cars, and others to sell them to live in the upscale neighborhoods. Many of the Ford and Mercedes car dealerships are considering changing their train of car producing to the newer ideal of intertiwning public transportation with the up and coming ideas of bikers on the rodes, and people using buses and subways instead of their own cars.

In Paris the smog in the air was soon thicker than it was in Beijing, China the citied known for its polluted air. Soon Parisian officials enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the smog. Monday's, motorists with even-numbered plates had been ordered to leave their cars at home or get a 22-euro fine, which is also $31. The same requirements were set in place for odd-numbered plates the following day. The first time this new ban was enforced nearly 4,000 dirvers were fined. Some even had their cars impounded for thier reaction to the new fine. The amount of traffic was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after the five days of an intensifying smog. The smog was caused by cold nights and warm days that caused the warmer layer of air to trap the car emissions. Diesel fuel was, of course, blammed as France has a tax policy for diesel fuel over gassoline. 67 percent of vehicles in Frane, compared to the 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. Paris would typically have more smog than the other European countries with the percentage of diesel fule they use daily. Paris had 147 micrograms of diesel per cubic meter last week compared to 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. Delivery companies lost revenue, but this starte an exception for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Soon the smog had cleared anouth on Monday for the ruling French party to take away the ban for odd-numbers plates on Tuesday.

The United States has long since been one of the world's prime car cultures. President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse has emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitious assist from a incipient shift in American behavior.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B15DEE2358C8,"Not driving cars sounds like a crazy idea; How will soccer moms get their kids to soccer practice; How will commuting executives get to their offices? Although driving a car is an easier way of getting around, the amount of pollution a car throws out into the atmosphere just isn't worth it. When people stop driving cars, they start to drastically reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that's being sent out through a car's tailpipes, reduces traffic congestion, and is satisfying a lot of people world wide.

Europe alone is responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, following the United States' 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, in some car-intensive areas. Paris, the capital of France that champions the use of diesel fuels typically has more smog than other European capitals, having 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. Although the bans on cars may receive complaints for delivery companies, there are exceptions such as; Plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more people.

As a result of Paris's partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city, almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and some even had their cars impounded. This partial ban led 60% decrease in traffic congestion. In Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians hiked,biked,skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of the capital city devoid of traffic jams. Rush-hour restrictions in Bogota have also dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have sprung up.

The reactions towards the idea of limiting car usage has been taken with great satisfaction and support. In the city of Bogota,Colombia, a city of 7 million people, millions of colombians participated in a car-free day by either skating,biking, or even hiking to work. Althought it rained, Mayor Antanas Mockus of Bogota explains, ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"". Mayor Antanas's quote just shows what people are willing to do, rather than taking the easier, and lazier way of simply taking their cars to work; In a sense, it shows dedication to the event. Even a high-society man like Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business man from Bogota describes this event as a, ""Good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". This idea; the idea of limiting the usage of cars can be excersized by any class of society, be it poor, middle class, upper class, even rich, can participate, anyone can participate.

In the end, the advantages of limiting car usage includes, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases, reducing traffic congestion, and satisfaction.                                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
6C3DE9491C5E,"From Monster trucks to Volkswagen Beetles, all automobiles are created to make life easier for people from all corners of the Earth. Many people start up their cars everyday without a second thought, whether trekking across the street or across the country. Others believe that cars are ruining the Earth, and put effort toward decreasing their car's ""footprint"" on the environment. People everywhere should consider limiting their car usage.

A community with less cars has proven to also be one with less healthy citizens. According to Source Two, Paris, a city known for it's aromatic scents, was covered with the smell and appearance of smog for days (they had near-record pollution: Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London). After a day in which all even-numbered license plates were banned from the streets of Paris, the smog cleared up a great amount (enough for the city officials to take the ban they had placed for odd numbered license plates the next day). The smog that was affecting the well-being of Paris' citizens had mostly disappeared after only one day of limited car use. If a community limits cars, its inhabitants will be almost forced to exercise more. According to Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, where a ""Day Without Cars"" is held yearly, 118 miles of bike paths have been constructed, the most of any Latin American city. Less cars on the road in this city have led to other means of transportation being more popular, including walking and bicycling. These ways of getting around are much more healthy then their gas-powered alternative. Less traffic on roads will therefore leave cities healthier than otherwise.

There are many more reasons why citizens should limit their personal car use. Owning a car is huge investment. You have to pay for gas and oil refills for any standard car based on how much it is driven. Because of this, limiting car use would also limit the pressure on car owner's wallets. According to Source One, the majority of residents of Vauban, Germany don't have cars. This city is an example of a worldwide effort to make suburbs denser. Because of this there is no need for automobiles to commute across the city. The purchase of a car, which costs thousands to even millions of American dollars for the average buyer, is unecesssary for the residents of this town and therefore can lead to better financial stability.

Car-driving, the catalyst to the wonders of travel, will continue to drive on the pollution of our Earth. Babysitters, doctors, students, and even the retired will thrive from limitations of car usage. Whether by limiting car usage or not, Earth's inhabitants need to ensure their planet is treated right.           ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
8FFFA9711FA2,"There are many advantages of limiting your car usage and it too can help the Earth. Limiting car usage can be very helpful towards your health and your environment around you. Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert duffer and Andrew selsky has all written down thier opnions down suggesting for more people to use bikes, buses or even walking to help people use less cars.

Why, would anyone walk but have easier transport by driving a car? because by walking you being saving money and lowering down pollution that is in the air. In

In German Suburb, Life goes on without cars written by Elisabeth Rosenthal; she is explaining how in Vauban,Germany is a ""car-free"" city and if you own a car owership you would have to pay a lot of money just for a space in your home for you car. Elisabeth has eclaimed that "" Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home"". This quote is showing how by owning your own car can cause too much money in a place that doen'st allow cars but when they do allow cars, you have to pay double of the price of a normal car. There is also something else that is interesing that Elisabeth has also stated: ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car- intensive areas in the United States"". This quote is showing us that cars waste too much gas and it goes up into our greenhouse and it is destroying our planet. If the percent number keeps going up, our earth can be harmful.

Also, by not using your car, it can lower down rush-hours and traffice. As stated in this quote by Andrew Selsky written in

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota: ""

Rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffice; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"". That is very good for the people because they would getting plenty of exerices while walking and they would not have to deal with beeping cars behind them or being stuck in the same place for couples of hours. If more people people come into walking or riding bikes to their homes,schools,or jobs; the bike places would get a lot of money for their bikes and that is good because the car dealership places would get less money and would close down. This quote from

The end of car culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal reflects how the bike shops would get new priorities: ""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation"". This is showing how paying for a bike would benefit you and the planet by not buying a car that is polluting the air.

Finally, Paris has been noticing smog going everywhere in france and needs to do something about it so they enforced a partial driving ban to clear up the air. As stated in this quote by Robert Duffer who has written

Paris bans driving due to smog,

""Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline"". This quote is explaining how using up too much gasoline can lead to serious problems like having heavy smog everywhere in the country. That only does France have heavy smog but Paris does have the most smog, other European countries as well as stated in this quote: ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic metere compared with 144 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found""(Duffer). Having so much smog that you aren't able to see toward can be very dangrous.

In concluson, Being able to save your money, and help out the Earth can always be a good thing. Polluting the air can lead to many problems in the future and that could damage many lives and places. Always know how to respect your planet by always using less gas or no gas at all. Biking and walking can lead to a better future and it would turn out better than using a car.                    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
DC22349FF001,"The advantages of limiting car usage is incredible because we can actually just get out of the house and hang out with friends and family. Also people could get some exersice at that by walking to work or school or wherever you are going to and the percentage of people with obesity would most likey drop down excessivley by just doing this.

You also might actually have a happier life by giving up automoblies for example what this person Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This evoultion of limiting car usage is very beneficial especially for the environment by decreasing carbon and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and all of the bad gasses going into the air by all these automobiles and just maybe get or climate and everything back together they way it should be.

In this new approach, to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation. Stores are placed just a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highways where you need a car to get there.

By doing things like this especially in America would be big in safety because you would have to worry as much about your children being hit or ran over by cars or being kidnapped to because you can only walk or ride bikes, taxis and public buses.

Therefore you can also take time and actually look where you are and where you live and take it all in instead of panicing and being all tense and stressed on having to rush or go somewhere and just being in a calm, peaceful and quiet location. Like in what thisperson Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman said "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" as he rode on a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

By doing this it would also decrease the amount of congestion in different cities across the globe.

In my opinion, I'd love to try in do this because we would  not be on our phones going strait to our cars  instead we would be walking or riding our bike or get on a public bus and actually see and meet people instead of just waiting in the traffic and waiting to just go and do whatever we want to and the Internet is a big deal in this to. A sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center cities various factors like: the Internet makes telecommutung possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to goo and meet up with friends. The rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has faciliated more flexible commuting arrangments, including the evolution of shared van services from getting to work.                    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Thats a huge number, to huge if you ask me. But some step are being taken to lower of car emissions around the world. Creating communites like vauban, germany, also by banning driving and having car free days. These are some thing that have taken place in order to lower car emissions.

In the suburbs of Vauban cars are not a factor in everyday life. There is no street parking , driveways and no home garages. 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars. People get around get around by walking, bicycling and the occasional tram. This drastically reduces greenhouse gases. In result this is one of the cleanest communities to live in.

In paris after days of near record pollution, they enforced a partial driving ban. Motorists with even numbered license plates were ""ordered to leaves their cars at home or suffer a fine. The same thing would happen with odd numbered plates the following. Car traffic was down 60 percent in the capital city of france. That helped the city a lot, enough to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on tuesday.

Bogota celibrates a car-free day. Hiking, biking, skating and bus riding all great chooses to get from place to place on this day. This helps to clean the air around us and help us breath better air.

United States seem to have pasted our use for cars as independent owners. We have also started several different programs or actions around the world to assure we stop pollution with the use of cars. Another way we have stop the use of car is car free days in some parts of the world. Also cars are believe to be stressful to human beings.

In some parts of the world mainly Bogota, Colombia they have start to reduce the use of cars to avoid pollution and promote the use of other types of transportation. As it is stated in source 3

On Monday motorists wit even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" this shows that Paris even supports the limiting car usages by humans.

Therefore us as the United States we have shown that even we are behind in our glory days of driving cars. As stated in source 4

:

The End of Car Culture by Rosenthal "" recent studies suggest that Americans as buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" So with that have been said we need to understand we drive no matter what but slow but surely we will stop driving in general. Due to the fact of that we do need to decrease our carbon release a pond the world. As it also states from article 4

or source 4

""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind the power plant."" This quote shows how it will affect us and also how it will benefit us as well.

Although driving feels amazing it gives you tons of stress to an individual. Not only that but it also makes you sometimes want to hurt someone. As well as feeling upset and sometimes wanting to cry due to a lack of funds to pay for gas as well as the worry of other drivers on the road. As stated in source 1

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Rosenthal a man states ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter.

:

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota he  states It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" said Carlos Arturo Plaza. This goes and show a lot of people are in support of this act or idea.

In conclusion limiting car use will benefit us in many ways but barely affect us at all. The main idea is to limit car usage and we can do that by the law that forces us stop car use in general. Another way we can accomplish this is by being an average teen in the United States.  An added bonus is that we have loads of stress by driving.

From people not driving cars, it reduces the greenhouse gas emissons. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percenet of the greenhouse gas emissons in Europe, and 50 percent in the United States. From people not using vehicles, and walk or ride bicycles instead, they tend to take the suburbs to get around. The suburbs are more compact and more accessible to the public than your own personal car. Now that they have taken away personal vehicles and gave them suburbs, the stores are a walk away on the main street, other than a walk on a distant highway. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency promoted ""car reduced communities.""

While in Paris, they banned driving because of the smog. On Mondays, vehicles with even-numbered license plates were told to leave their vehicles at home or suffer a $31 fine. The same thing with the odd numbered license plates the next day. Almost 4,000 of the drivers were fined because they didn't follow the rules and their cars got impounded. The cold nights and warm days caused the smog to form which made a thick layer of air to trap the car emissions. Diesel fuel is the biggest issue because it makes up 67 percent of the vehicles in France compaired to 53.3 percent in Western Europe. When the smog cleared up on Monday, the French party went after the odd-numbered licensed plates on Tuesday and fined them.

In Bogota, Columbia there is a program that was sent to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses, left the city and avoided the traffic jams. Cars have been banned to the point were people can ride buses and be taxed with the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. Their goal is to promote the transportation and reduce the smog. For the first time, two other Columbian cities joined the event. The parks and sport centers were fixed throughout the city. The uneven sidewalks have been replaced, rush hour restrictions have cut traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas have cropped up.

The end of car culture is president Obama's goals are to change the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years go on. Mr. Sivak said that when he was in his late 20s early 30s, he was curious about what kind of car he drove, but no one really cared as long as it got you from point A to point B. A study was done last year and it stated that young drivers decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. At the Mobile World Congress last year in Bill Ford, Barcelona and Spain, the For Motor Companys chairman laid the business plan out for the world to see.

A city in Germany has gone the extra mile to solve problems due to car use. What the residents of Vauban, an upscale suburban community have done is, they have all given up their cars. Street parking, driveways, and garages are not allowed. The only way to park is to buy a parking spot along with your home for $40,000. Because of this movement 70 percent of families there do not own cars and 57 percent sold theirs to move to Vauban. A media trainer and mother of two said that when she had a car she was always tense but now is much happier. This no car movement is called ""smart planning"". A reason it started is because studies have shown that passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in america. The basic ideas from Vauban are being adopted around the world attempting to make suburbs more compact with less space for parking. Now in the US many agencies are promoting car reduced communities. Also legislators are starting to act. Many say public transport in suburbs will play a much larger role in a new 6 year federal transportation bill to be approved this year. More suburbs like this one could change the world.

In Paris there had been days of near-record pollution. To help clear the city's air Paris enforced a partial driving ban. Monday, moterists with even numbered liscence plates were forced to leave their cars at home or pay a $31 fine. Rejecting the fine resulted in having your car impounded. As a result 60 percent of congestion was down in France's capitol. The smog due to car usage was cleared enough on monday to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates the next day. In Columbia a similar day is taken place every year. A car free day where people hiked, biked, skated and took buses to work instead of driving their cars. If you violated this you would be fined $25. Even in rainy weather people participated just to help lower stress and air pollution. This campaign has sparked a revolution. It has also created the construction of 118 miles of bike paths, parks, and sports centers. It has caused the replacement of pitted sidewalks with broad smooth ones, cut traffic, and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have appeared. If every country had a day like this we could make a unbelievable difference.

According to recent studies Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer liscences each year. Even though America has basically been the birthplace of cars and is one of the world's prime car cultures its love seems to be cooling down. The number of miles driven in the US peaked in 2005 and steadily declined in the years following. In april 2009 the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below its peak and equal to where it was in 1995. Part of the problem has most definitely been recession but as the economy recovers the decrease in driving has not changed. According to a research proffessor at University Of Michigan car ownership per household started to lower two to three years before the downturn. If this trend persists it will have benificial implications for carbon emmissions and the environment. One of the things causing this is the internet which allows people to feel more connected to eachother without driving to meet friends. Also people car-pooling and biking have helped. There has been a large drop in peoples age 16-20 getting their liscence. They organize summer jobs and their social lives around where they can walk or take public transportation, or carpool. Between 2001 and 2009 driving by young people decreased 23 percent. All of this helps conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.

In conclusion there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Many communities have taken part of this trend and it is rapidly being recognized around the world. Taking part in this helps the community and environment. Anyone can do it.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D9376FA15233,"There are many efforts from different countries to reduce car usage.  Countries like Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States are trying to raise awareness and get people to not use their car as much.  These countries are raising awareness for example by having car-free days, banning driving for a day, turning suburbs into car-free communities, and rasing awareness about how cars affect the enviroment.  These counrties are making the efforts to reduce car usage because they know that there are great advantages if citizens limit their car usage.

In Vauban,Germany, low-car suburban life is their motto.  Car ownership is allowed , but with a price.  As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move to Vauban.  Heidrun Walter says that she is happier without a car and when she did have a car, she says she was always tense.  Vauban is an example of the efforts and new idea that Europe, United States, and elsewhere have to reduce car usuage.  Some advantages of this low-car concept is that now stores are being placed in walking distance and malls and resturants are also within walking distance and close to each other.

Because of air pollution and smog due to cars, Paris had to start banning people from driving certain days.  If you  were caught driving when you weren't suppose to, a fine was inforced.  Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters.  Diesel fuel was the blame of the smog because France perfers diesel over gas.  Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France according to Reuters.  Paris has more smog than most European capitals.  This is really hurting the enviroment.  While Paris was banning cars, congestion was down 60 percent.  Besides car congestion being down 60 percent, other advatages to this car banning was that non-hybrid car companies lost revenue while hybrid and plug in cars were not.  This shows how people are aware of the pollution of cars.  Also, because of the reduced driving, the smog in Paris was cleared enough to stop banning certain vehicles from driving.

A big event in Bogota, Colombia is their car-free day.  Only buses and taxis were permitted.  Violators of the car-free day faced a fine.  The turnout was large even though there was rain.  ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"", said the Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus.  Citizens of Colombia were happy participating in the car-free day.

""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode his bike.  Municipal authorities from all over the world came to see this event. The city's mayor also says that the day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid- 1990's.  The advantage of the car-free day has made parks and sports centers more popular to go to and other advatages is that the old sidewalks are being replaced with new paved ones.  The traffic has also reduced.

In the United States, President Obama goals are to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions.  The Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities.  The efforts to reduce driving is paying off.  A study found that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.  Mr. Sivak's research shows a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39 year olds getting a liscense.  In New York, there is a new bike sharing program and that can help people to choose to take bike instead of riding in a car.

All these efforts are helping people make the decision to limit their car usage and based on the facts, there are alot of advantages if you limit car usage.  This is only a start to raise efforts to reduce car usage, but I feel in the future we will be seeing a lot more people walking and biking than riding their car.             ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Now, few people would equate soccer moms to such pioneers as Lewis and Clark but in their own way, they kind of are. In many European cities and suburbs, people have almost completely given up driving and cars. As hard as it is to imagine a sprawling city without drive ways and street parking, it is almost forbidden in the cities participating in this experiment.

Everyone knows that cars emit greenhouse gases and it's oh so bad for the environment and blah blah blah, and we all care. We really do. But do we care enough to give up our cars? Most likely not. But we could all stand to limit our driving, and it's easy enough. If the grocery store is only a few blocks away how about riding your bike or walking? You'll get a little exercise and a little less pollution. And while you're taking this walk, imagine the silence you would hear if everybody else was also doing this and the streets were empty. ""The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" (Source 1). Aside from just the noise pollution our buzzing motors give us, the air pollution is much worse. Cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gases in Europe and fifty percent in some North American cities (Source 1). Beijing, China, the most polluted city in the world (Source 2) which is known for its intense smog, was almost shown up by the capital of France. Since Paris' government favors diesel over gasoline, they know exactly what was to blame. Closer to home, America's second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions is due to the transportation industry (Source 4).

On the topic of big cities and driving the first picture that comes to mind is a big highway filled with honking cars and irritated drivers. Traffic. Los Angeles and New York City are only a few prime examples. Heidrun Walter, a mother in the car-less city of Vauban said, ""When I had a car I was always tense.

In cities with little to no car usage traffic has been dramatically cut down and with it pollution and stress levels. The two day car ban in Paris, France not only cleared smog but brought down congestion, or car traffic. Bogota, Colombia has a population of seven million people who participate in the Day Without Cars to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" (Source 3). Regardless of the rainy weather, the decrease in use of cars has sparked the construction of bike paths and new sidewalks.

Minimizing to eradicating car usage would drastically decrease resource use, wasted time and pollution outputs while steadily increasing our own safety. Maybe next time you're ready to jump right in your car, consider another method of transportation.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D54E4C7B39CB,"Car usage around the world is causing an increase in pollution, greenhouse gas, and obesity. Cities have had to shut down roads and ban driving just to clear the pollution in the air due to car usage.

This is why the world must put limitations on car usage. If we limit the usage of cars we will be rewarded with numerous benefits, such as: better health, clean cities, and new relationships, in turn.

""But cars take us everywhere we need to go and fast! Why should we not use them?!"" Many people exclaim when first hearing about this idea. While getting to your destination fast, you begin to speed up everything around you. Trying to get everything over with as fast as possible. For example, a teenager is driving home, he notices he has 5 extra minutes because he was speeding, and he feels hungry. So what will he do? He will go drive through a McDonalds and get his dinner. Now, not only has he added to greenhouse gas and the pollution of his city, he is also polluting his body. Another downfall of the use of cars is safety. Millions of car accidents happen every single year killing thousands of people. Cars give stupid people too much power and speed then they need. You would not experience a bike crash or public transit bus crash as often as you would a car crash. Cars don`t just affect personal safety, they endanger your city. Driving hundreds of cars around one area will definitely lead to the collection of fuel emissions ehich in turn produces smog. Paris, France had to put a restriction on car usage because of the fact that the city`s air was covered in smog. Who on earth wants to live in a city of smog. The restriction acted as a test, to see if they could omit fuel emissions and help reduce the smog. So, one day all the even licensed plates were banned from driving while, the next day all the odds were banned from driving. This plan worked so well it didn`t last more than a couple of days. Car usage is a big issue worldwide and it needs to be stopped.

""Wouldn`t the limitation of car usage be a waste of cars?"" No. the answer is plain and simple no. Countries worldwide are taking action to wean people off of using personal cars. In Bogota Colombia, they have the Day Without Cars, a holiday in which you can not, at any time , use your automobile. The city of 7 million all use bicycles, and other forms of non technological transportation to move around the city. People who do not participate will be subject to paying money.

This day has caused new bike paths to be built, parks, sport centers to grow more popular, and decreases the air pollution of Colombia. Another country taking part in the no car festivities is Germany. In Vauban you will experience a ""car free"" community. This town has stores built within walking distance, and offers public transport to travel around the town. ""I`m much happier this way"" said a german mother of 2. She walks the town and speaks of the noises she hears such as the ""swish of bicycles"" and ""chatter of children"". The limitation of the cars has brightened the communtiy as a whole and allowed for it`s residents to be more happy and healthy as they walk or bike most places. Also, studies show that happiness and good health are directly related so while fixing the negative effects of car use you are also stopping the vicious cycle of obesity .

Over all, the world would be a much better place without a high usage of cars. These new ideas and innovations are testing the ideals of a car free society and frankly, they are getting positive results.  Without cars, the world would be a much cleaner, healthier and happier place for all.

09F5B48F1543,"Cars are believed to be mandatory in life today. They get use where we need to go quicker that it is to walk or ride a bike. Cars have many positive effects, but also many negatives. The gas emission percentage from cars in several countries have risen dramtically. Many people say, having a car stresses you out. By cuttin down on car usage, our world could be a cleaner and stress relieved place.

In many middle-class populated cities, the amount of pollution is sky rocketing. Because of this, some cities like Vauban, Germany are making their communties car free. Doing this can cut down on the amount of gas that comes from the tail pipes of cars, making the enviroment healthier and making it easier to breathe. Not as many cities are going as extreme as Vauban, but they taking the extra measures. In Paris, France the amount of pollution to due to car usage was getting higher by day. So they enforced a partial drivng ban, if they didnt follow this law they would have to pay the thirty one dollar fine. In Bogota, Colombia, they have a car free day that is now spreading to the borders, such as Paraguay. Even by cutting down a few times a day will not only help the enviroment, but will also help people breathe easier too.

Having a car can put a lot of stress on someones shoulders. You have to worry about maintence, gas prices and even traffic on the main highway on your way to work. If you take away that stress people will be happier than if they got stuckin traffic to or from where theyre going.

Driving is something that doesnt require much physical effort. It can make people lazy. In Bogota, Colombia during their car-free day, people ride bikes, skate or even walk to places. In New York's bike-sharing program not only is it cutting down on gas emissions, its also helping people stay in shape and bemore active.

So while having cars helps us get places sooner and quicker, its also having any negative effects people are turning a blind eye to. If even one city cuts down on driving for one day, it could help the enviroment. Many cities, states, and even countries are trying to cut down on the negative effects driving has.

As technology advances the world will start to get rid of things we use to use before, so that those new advancements could come and take their place, as time flies we might not need cars anymore, even though they are the most useful thing to get us from one place to another, they are also devastating for our community, and our environment. Now knowing that most people would never let go of there cars due to the amount of money people spend to buy them, that giving them up isn't going to be so easy. However giving up your car will have a major benefit to our everyday life, also there are many other alternatives that you could use instead of your car that will not only benefit you but also the people around you, such as bikes, busses, trains, and subways. Now that most companies are going green, they are developing ways to not let harmful gasses produced by vehicles that burn fossil fuels to stop damaging the earths atmosphere, so the air we breath isn't toxic and life threatening so maybe one day everyone can live in a much cleaner safer place.

In a suburb in Germany, the residents have given up their cars completely as to where street parking, driveways and home garages are a thing of the past. There are now only two known ways of parking which is having to buy a parking garage space for $40,000, and your house. It has been working very well because 70% of the towns families don't own cars, and 57% of the people sold their cars to move there. Now being in a car is where the true form of someone comes out, you don't need to even be a driver but you still will experience ""Road rage,"" thats when someone else gets so mad that they will start saying things they dont need, or want to say, but it just comes out with anger that they dont care about what they said. Being to angry is bad for someone because it causes stress and anger issues that will later lead on to heath problems and car accidents, now if we reduce the number of drivers, or even come to a point where driving a car doesn't even exist anymore, the amount of angry people will be reduced, thus making the world a little bit nicer than it already is.

Now bringing the topic back reducing cars will reduce the amount of accidents followed by them. Think about everyone you know, now picture those you love who have died by a car accident, Now whether they died by texting, drinking or someone else hit them    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E978C0850898,"As a result of the decrease usesage of cars over the past years. people have found it to be beneficial to use other means or tranportations such as bikes,walking, or even taking a public tranportations. Not only is it more excercise to walk or ride a bike rather then to take a car and getting to your destination faster,but it can cause less pollution on the earth then their is already. Other reasons to give up on your cars like it said it source 2 its less traffic out during busy days.

Source number 2 was saying that they made a deal or law is you call it to fine the drivers that drove during the day,they were to leave the car at home and take other means of tranportation to get to their destination. Many people didnt like it so thy complained and got their car inpunded for a day due to complaing. they were tying this beause they use diesel rather then gasoline it makes about 67% of france .It can be done in bigger states or cities like it showed in sourve 3 colombia had a population of over 7 million people but they tried it and yet many people liked it even when bad weather showed up they didnt seem to mid it and fot the others they were fine a total of $25 if the droved anywhere that day. so over all limiting the car usage is helpull by casusing less trafiic in busy streets or places .

Other  then the  usage of less car the companies had complain that many people are buying less cars now that some people rather walk or bike then to buy a car and waste money on gasoline,and repairing the damages that might come to the car. It not only safes money for people but its more then ever safer for children to be out playing and less people behind the wheel of a car and making parents much more comfortable and less worried. like it said in source 3 that many people started to actually like the new way things were working now that less people use cars and its safer and causes less polluiton to the world by doing so.

As a result limiting the usage of cars can have a huge impact on someone regular life that use to driving everywere,and to all of a sudden stop using cars. Their is more impotant reasons to limit car using such as its safer for people,less car accidents ,safes money ,less pollution on the world, and last but not least  it safes time.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

There are many up sides to it, it has a few downsides such as not being able to car far distances...but thats exactly where public transportation comes in. One great advantage to limited car usage is the reduced amount of obesity. When you dont have a car your only other options would be to walk, bike, skate, etc. which helps you lose weight. Not only that, but more parks and sport centers are being constructed. What about traffic? No one likes traffic, so by reducing the amount of cars in a given area, there will be close too no traffic at all. You'd be able to get to work or school on time, not have to worry about finding a parking spot, and generally get to where you need to be in a quicker amount of time.

In 2006, Vauban completion was an example of a trend growing in Europe and the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use. Planners would like to make cities denser and better for walking. That's why walk ways are placed on main streets andd not the main highway.

Almost 4,000 drivers were fined for driving with even numbered license plates. Twenty seven people had their car impounded because of their reactions to this fine. Car emissions were cause because of cold nights and warm days. Some people blamed fuel as a tax policy favor diesel over gasoline. Everything was going bad with vehicles and tax policies.

72B560BE6C3B,"Do you think there are advantages to reducing car usage?  There are many advantages in limiting car usage.  Reducing car usage can decrease the amount of pollution and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  It can increase physical activity and decrease stress.  There can be numerous advantages when we reduce the amount of car usage.

To begin, there are various advantages in reducing the amount of car usage.  Limiting car usage can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere.  ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""  (

In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal).  This is an example of how greenhouse gases are polluting the atmosphere; limiting car usage can reduce the amount of pollution being released.  ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza"".  (

Car-free Day Is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogota by Andrew Selsky).  This is an example of the advantages of limiting car usage.

In addition, some people may think that there are no advantages to limiting car usage; however, they don't think about how it can help the world around them.  Durning a car-free day in Bogota, people will use different transportations and avoid traffic jams.  ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (

The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal).  This is an example of how over the years, people are using less car fuel and reducing air pollution.  People are beginning to realize that buying a car is not a priority.  To reduce pollution and save movey, people car-pool with others.  ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.."".  (

The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal).  this states that the number of young people are not driving as much as they use to; therefore, it helps reduce the amount of greenhouse gases being released and amount of people on the road.

Finally, there are many advantages in limiting car usage.  Limiting the amount of car usage will reduce greenhouse gases, stress behind the wheel, and traffic jams.  Greenhouse gases can be very harmful when released into the atmosphere.  There may be less deaths due to crashes, and less frustration due to traffic.  There can be many advantages and people around the world should consider limiting their car usage.

First,in passage one showe that life can still go on whtout the ues of car. This is clear when Rosenthal write in paragharp three ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". this show that the prason is mush happier whitout he/she car. This clarey show that limiting car usage can make you lass tense on the stree.

We use cars for daily life, to make it through this world, whether its to work, school, the store, it seems almost impossible to live without one. Vauban, Germany is an upscale community of suburban pioneers who have simply given up their vehicles. As many as 70 percent of Vauban's famalies do not own cars. Heidrun Walter, a resident and mother of two, says she is ""much happier this way"". So what it is that has caused many communites like Vauban to take the advantage of living without a car? Green House gases better known as smog, that is polluting our air that we breathe.

In some places like the beloved Paris, home of the Eiffel Tower, smog has gotten out of hand. Paris has even enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. After 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty seven had their cars impounded for their claimed reaction to the fine, the congestion was finally down 60 percent. Beijing, China, known for being the most polluted cities in the world the smog rivals. You might even see people wearing masks in Beijing for their own health and safety.

Bogota, Colombia has caught on and spread this idea to other countries as well. For the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis allowed for a Day Without Cars. Not even rain or shine stopped Colombians from traveling accordingly. Instead of being pessimistic about traveling alternatively most Colombian see it as a good opprutunity to take away stress and lower smog. So, imagine a day without cars in the bustling city of our own, maybe like Detroit. Well it seems that President Obama is catching on.

Recent studies suggest a drop in Americans getting licenses', buying cars, and driving all together as years pass. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and is dropping from there steadily. Could it be that Americans love for cars is simply not what it used to be? Or is it that more alternate and practical ways of travel are now being provided and accepted widely? Either way if our country keeps up the good work sociologist believe it will have ""beneficical implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment"".

81EC93D0EF50,"Is limiting car usage a benefitial way to reduce many uneccessary smog and pollution in any part of the world? This is a case of many opinions. Many people say it is beneficial to the environment and where they live in. Others disagree about limiting car usage due to slow mobility going from place to place that might be far away. In my opinion, i do support the idea that limiting car usage is a helpful way to reduce smog and many other pollutants that might spread in the natural world. For example, reducing smog from the air helps animals and humans to breath better air and reduces the risk factor of getting a decease from the pollution or smog. Also, it just not only cleans the air but it helps citizens live a helathier life by always staying physically active either going from place to place.

It is a great way to reduce smog or pollution by limitng car usage and helps stop cars and truscks to stop generating many malitiant gases that may cause deceases. According to Source #3, its states that ""Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day."" This is a great example and idea of living in an environment that has reduced the amount of pollution generated by cars and trucks. Not using cars can also help the animals in the environment they live in. Animals also have a roll

Penultimately, the limiting of car usage also helps citizens live a healthier life by staying physically active and helps them stay in shape. Doing exercise everyday can also help reduce the risk factor of getting inmobile. Transportation like walking and jogging to places and not using mechanical transportation is the best way due to the fact that we dont produce pollution or smog.

Finally, limiting the car usage  can help reduce pollution and smog for many reasons. It can help the environment we live in and helps citizens stay physically active and healthy. It also helps animals live better due to the air they breathe. We need to take part on cleaning the place we live in and so if we caused smog and pollution into the air, Why not make a change and reduce what we already created?

To lower this statistic, many cities around the world are trying to cut down on car use in order to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. Cities like Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, and Bogota, Colombia have their own strategies for the reduction of these emissions from cars. These cities are having extraordinary success and many Americans are limiting their car usage as well.

In Vauban, Germany, many residents have given up their cars. This is due to the strict rules and limitations for car ownership in this experimental new district. If one would like to own a car, large garages that cost $40,000, along with a home must be bought. This has made many residents completely give up the use of cars and rely on public transportation and bicycles. In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, one resident stated,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Residents are embracing this new and innovative lifestyle and as a result, the greenhouse gas emissions from this area in Germany has decreased exponentially. The location of stores and businesses has also changed due to the very few who use automobiles. In the article, it is revealed, ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Even with these limitations, residents are not complaining and as a result, new suburbs around the world may start to look and be like Vauban, Germany.

Many cities around the world are being forced to issue partial driving bans in order to clear the air of the city. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", by Robert Duffer, it is explained how and why the city of Paris was forced to issue partial driving bans due to the very high levels of smog. Duffer writes, ""On Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" Due to this partial ban, congestion was down 60 percent and 4,000 drivers were fined. These fined drivers paid, in total, around 88,0000-euro($124,000). Not only did the pollution decrease dramatically but this money went back to the government. The article then reveals, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" After just one day, the results that was wanted by the city of Paris were achieved. This is absolutely astounding and very beneficial to the city of Paris and also to Europe as a whole.

Like in Paris, France, in Bogota Colombia, car-free days have been established. In the article, "" Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, the Day Without Cars in Bogota is detailed. Like in Paris, there were fines for violators, however this time it is $25. Due to the fine, many of the 7 million resident used public transportation, taxis, bicycles in order to get where they needed to go. One resident said, ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution."" As a result of the success that Bogota has with these car-free days, more than 118 miles of bicycle paths have been made, sidewalks have been repaired, and many new restaurants and shopping districts have emerged. Other cities in Colombia and other cities in South America want to follow Bogota's lead. In the article, the mayor of  Asuncion, Paraguay Enrique Riera, is quoted saying, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and that is crossing borders."" Hopefully, the car-free days that Bogota has will be common around South America and eventually around the world.

A new global trend is emerging and that is the decrease in car usage. Cities like Vauban, Germany has a large majority of its residents using public transportation and bicycles and many residents have acceoted and embraced this lifestyle. Cities like Paris and Bogota have partial driving bans and car-free days, respectively, and as a result smog and pollution in the air has decreased and many residents feel like it is a good way to take away stress. These changes bans and car-free days have lowered pollution dramatically and many feel like this is a good path for the future. Limiting car usage is beneficial to the world and these cities have proven that it can be achieved without many issues and hopefully many other cities around the world will copy this innovative new idea toward decreasing greenhouse emissions.                                            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Some people are saying that cars make them tense and by walking it makes them happier and more relaxed. They dont have to stress about putting gas in the car or driving safely. They are also trying to ""make cities denser, and better for walking""(article 1 paragraph 6) Puting stores closer to areas with a higher population so people can walk to them helps. This is an advantage to people who live in car-free areas.

Paris is also taking part to help better our environment. They have ""enfoced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" according to the article

Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog . The city is being more forceful with this action by giving a fine of 22-euros ($31) to people who didnt leave their cars home on their day. Due to having these days banned from driving ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" (article 2 paragraph 14) By doing these two day France was no longer considered the most poluted city in the world, Beiging, China was the new holder of this name. People are now hopeing to get ""plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers"" This will help bennifit the environment by decreasing the air pollution in the air.

BOGOTA, Colombia is making their move by having a car-free day where Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. "" The goal is to promate altrenative transportation and reduce smog"" according to the article

Car- free Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota . They want to show people there are several other ways to get somewhere without useing a car. A couple using a two-seat bicycle said it was a great way to take away stress and lower air pollution. Other cities in Colombia are also taking part in this event. Now the city of Bogota is making 118 miles of bike pathways for people to use daily. This day helps more people get outside and get active to. The article also states that "" Parks and sport centers also have bloomed throughout the city"" Having this day reduces the air pollution that was occuring and helps people relax.

To conclude, many citys are taking part in this act. They limited the car use and helped limit air pollution. People are starting to use cars less and take more alternative routes like walking or biking. Maybe you should try walking or riding a bike to work or school. You may like that more then driving and it helps the environment!            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
83D951A9B86F,"It is becoming increasingly evident that one part of life many older people took for granted may be going away soon. The invention of the car was revolutionary, but in modern times it seems that many wish to build communities that do not revolve around them. The reason for doing this vary somewhat across the different movements, but one main reason is that recuding car useage will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases and pollution. In fact, many places where this movement has gained traction are citites where pollution was a major issue, such as Paris and Bogota. Another factor is that many people simply are not as interested in cars as they were a few years ago, and have licenses only as a backup. The various movements are spreading all over the world, slowly but surely.

""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eeirly devoid of traffic jams,"" said Andrew Selsky of the Seattle times. Bogota, Colombia is notable for being one of the earlier players in this movement, and has shown that it can be effective. Not even rain convinced people that cars would be a better option. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrique Riera. Not only have other Colombian cities joined in the movement, but is has inspired similar actions in other countries. It would only be a matter of time before some people would take it to the next level.

""Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars,"" said Elisabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times. While not outright banned, cars are looked down upon in this square mile rectangle, where it is much easier to simply walk or bike. The only places to park are a $40,000 parking garage and inside one's house. ""...Some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world..."" said Rosenthal. This approach is gainging ground, as not only does the model inherently reduce carbon emissions, but also is a sharp contrast to 1950s-style suburbs that previously dominated the land. Another probable reason, however, might be due to shifting interests. You might soon be seeing less cars in general.

""...America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling,"" said Rosenthal. America may be the home of the classic muscle car, but many people today would rather have something less flashy and more utilitarian. 2005 was the year where the most people were driving in recent times, and ever since then it has been dropping. ""I think that it means something fundamental it going on,"" said Prof. Michael Sivak of the University of Michigan. Many people are simply losing interest in driving cars, while some people simply cannot afford them due to socioeconomic factors. Also, the advent of the Internet and social netowrking has made many people ""feel more conncected"" without the need to drive around in oder to meet someone in real life. If this trend continues, which it is predicted to do, then situations like what recently occured in Paris would be more readily accepted.

""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban to clear the air of the global city,"" said Robert Differ of the Chicago Tribune. It seems almost surreal for a major city to outright ban driving, but that is exactly what Paris did. Cars are occasionally banned based on their license plate, so as to still let some traffic flow while reducing smog, which had become a major problem for the city. ""...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" said Differ. Of all the European capitals, Paris is by far the most polluted, mostly due to a combination of warm weather and the abundance of diesel fuel. The simple act of banning driving has been a major help in reducing smog, with the skies clearing up enough for it to be considered safe for odd-numbered cars to return to the streets. It still might take some time for other cities to go to measures as extreme as Paris did, but it very well might happen eventually.

The world has seen many communities test the idea of modern carless commuting for us, and we should be taking notes. While copying Paris seems like a risky way to start, communities like Vauban are excellent baby steps, and major citites like Bogota participating in these activities only once a year can get people used to the idea elsewhere. Decreasing carbon emissions is an important goal for urban areas, and for a while it seemed like cars were a neccesary evil. Now, however, it has been shown that life can go on without them. Perhaps further experiments will occur in the future that will introduce the idea to more people, letting others consider various options. Now is the perfect time to prepare for the future.

This rule has influenced almost everyone to rid their cars and begin to ride bikes, skate boards, etc. I believe this rule to pay $40,000 for a garage sapce along with a home at the edge of the development is comeplaly and utterly ridiculous. But I also think this rule made made to inforce everyone to rid their cars, because unless one were to have enough money to pay the $40,000, you would have to give up your car.

In Source #2 ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" it speaks about Paris having a fine for 22 euros ($31) for driving as well. It states "" Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters... [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine."" Because the driving fine was not so expensive some people did not mind to pay the fee. This article also states ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...

In America, we use vehicles on a daily basis to get around.  You either drive a vehicle that you own, ride a bus, take a taxi, ride a bike, or walk.  It is rare to see someone walking or riding a bike these days, but that is because we are so dependant on motor vehicles.  If you take a look at other countries, you will realize that they are taking steps to cut back on the use of motor vehicles to help stop pollution.

It is uncommon in the U.S. for a whole town of people to ""give up"" their cars, let alone pay $40,000 for a parking space and a house.  In Vauban,Germany, this ""smart planning"" movement was introduced to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of cars in the area.  ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and media trainer.  70 percent of families living in Vauban do not own cars and walk or ride bikes to reach their destinations.  The town is not completely ""car free,"" there is a main thoroughfare that runs from downtown Freiburg.  Considering the town was only built about ten years ago, they are helping our environment in a big way.

Smog is a big problem in Paris,France.  After several days of ""near-record pollution,"" Paris temporarily baned driving to clear the cities air.  About 4,000 drivers recieved a 22-euro fine and 27 of those drivers had their cars impounded because of their reaction to their fine.  The fine worked and the cities congestion was down to 60 percent after five days of the smog.  The cities weather was part of the reason why there was so much smog, but some people believed it had to do with the diesel fuel that was used throughout France.  The public transit was free from Friday to Monday, but the smog eventually cleared and the band was lifted.           ",1,Car-free cities,Text dependent

the article reads ""after days of near-record pollution, paris enforces a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""

anyone who had an odd numberd tag on one of the days and was cought driving would  get a $31 ticket. and revers for the even numberd tags on the next day. so the cars took turns driving. meaning there would be less cars on the street on those certain days.

If we were to limit the amount of car usage all around the world we would be living in a much better place. Imagine how much pollution is going into the air as we use our cars, many people all around the world use their cars to get from their home to work or from work to home. All the polution that is going into the air is affecting us and the way we live our everyday lives.

In the city of Bogota Columbia they have a ''Car Free Day."" This program is set to spread to other countries in the next few years. During the event of car free day millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work or to their home. This caused the streets of the capital city to devoid all the traffic jams that they normally would have with the cars on the road. You would think the turnout would be extremely small for this event but no it was definitely not a small turnout. The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that occasionally dumped rain showers on Bogota. ""The rain hasnt stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Imagine if the United states were to have a ''Car free day"" not many people would actually come and be apart of the event due to the fact that having cars is one of the most important things to have living in the United States.

In other countries or cities the people are worried about the air pollution that is going into our atmosphere. In the city of Paris, officials feel the same way about the citizens of there city using there car way to much and polluting the atmosphere. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Not many people agreed with this ban when it started. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reauters. Twenty Seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Except there are some advantages to this ban, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france. But the smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most populated cities in the world. Having rules or banning certain things like a partial driving ban could have a good turnout or a really bad turnout with the citizens of that particular country or city.

However, some people may say that limiting car usage or banning certain things like driving won't help at all. They may state that banning something will make people rebel against it especially if it's with their car, and if that is how they get from place to place. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.''Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term curtural shift,'' said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason the resume the habit. Poeple in the Untied States have begun to decrease the use of cars in every state which means that everyday our atmosphere becomes less polluted.

Living in a world where cars are everyone's number one priority is horrible. Using a car is one of the main reasons why our earth is extremely polluted. Limiting the amount of car use has it's negative side and it also has it's positive sides. Could you imagine what it would be like to have a non-polluted earth or living a better life by using bikes, skates or even just walking to places would be like.

Another example of over pollution problems due to cars is Paris, France. Source Two states, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"".  Congestion was down 60 percent for those five days. The reason there was so much smog in the air was due to the diesel fuel. Diesel fuel is the mail fuel used in France, 67 percent of the people there use it.  Another factor could be the climate there. With ""cold nights and warm days caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" Stated in Source Two.

Europe isn't the only continent seeing change. Bogota, Colombia was celebrating its 3rd straight year of, Day Without Cars. The Day Without Cars is a banning of cars and only busses and taxis are permitted.  Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". For the first time this year, two more Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar are taking part in this Day Without Cars.

America too is seeing change with cars.  The number of miles driven in the US peaked in 2005, but has been steadily dropping after. As of April 2013, 'the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the county was in January 1995"", states Source four.  Although the drop in car usage will have a benificial effect on the environment, it will have negitave implications for car industries.  Ford and Mercedes are already taking steps to rebrand themselves to ""mobility"" companies.  Although car companies aren't the only ones changing their ways due to the drop in car usage.  New York started a new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing.  They have started building more bike paths and tunnel tolls are reflecting the new priorities.

821BF3C9418C,"""No one cares about the environment."" said no one ever. The environment we live in, wether its a crowded city like NewYork, or Paris, or even a regular suburban community, is a wonderful place. There is one issue though that has spread among communities, and that is the high amount of car usage. Having a car and being able to track to great distances in a short amount of time is great, but look at what cars do to the environment. Also when it comes to buying a car, you're basically throwing your bank account out the window. And dont get me started with the worries of having your children play in the streets.

Now, lets discuss the crazy amount of money you have to throw away on a car. You either throw away a fortune on a good car, that runs good, and then end up taking years to pay it off, or you buy a cheap, beat up car, that is always in need of repair. Either way it is a lose, lose situation. Why buy these isanely priced cars when you can buy a nice bike that moves perfectly. At around five hundred dollars, to a thousand dollars a bike is easily the way to go. A bonus to buying a nice bike instead of a car, is that while you ride your bike, you'll get into shape in no time at all. Now if you need to track a great distance that riding a bike can not get you to fast enough, buses or mobile transport have bike racks on them so you can ride a bus to the nearest position to where you need to be then simply ride your bike for the remainder of the distance.

The main issue here with cars for most people, is that there is a large amount of pollution that comes with driving a car. In Paris the pollution from cars were so bad that Paris had to put a temporary ban on driving to help clear out all of the smog that was in the sky. Also, in America car pollution is the second largest source of pollution emissions. There is no other way to say it, cars make up a lot of the earths pollution, and when the time comes that people start to die down on using cars the world will be a much healthier place to be in.

Now you can not tell me that there is not at least one parent who will read this next statement and not agree more. Less cars, safer streets. Every mom, dad, brother, sister, or any kind of other relative have worried about their family playing in the streets. There are millions of accidents every year in the world that result in people getting hit by cars and killed, or seriously injured. With less cars on the streets the world will be a much safer place for kids, and even adults, as there is drunk drivers you have to look out for, or reckless drivers who dont even have a license.

All together limiting car usage will have multiple benefits to the world, and even your own community. One being you dont have to pay for a car when they start going out of style, another being the worlds pollution will lower at a huge rate, and last that the roads we live, and breathe on will be a much safer place.

3DABFB0A459C,"A New Era

Times are changing, and changing fast. While the car may once have been the ideal accessory to a rapidly changing world, people have now found that the opposite is now true. Limiting car usage is cheaper, better for the enviorment, and is quickly becoming the ""cool"" thing to do. America's facination with the 1950's fords are over, and a new era is upon us.

Cutting down on car usage is much cheaper. Between the expensive vehicle itself and enormous gas bill, It's more fiscally responsible to carpool, use public transportation, or even walk. Places like Vauban in Germany are just the start of a quickly growing social trend to make cars more expensive. As stated in Source 1, ""There are only two places to park-Large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home"". Places like Paris have even been known to enact partial driving bans at times, with 22-euro fines enacted for those who failed to follow the ban. Driving, an already expensive task, is increasingly becoming a task only the rich can afford.

Removing some of our outrageous motor vehicle usage is also good for the enviorment.  As mentioned in Source 2, Smog that was already prevalent in places like Beijing, China has found it's way into modern European cities like Paris, with more to follow if we do't cut back, and soon. Paris has known to have over 147 Micrograms of pariculate matter per cubic meter, with other cities like Brussels and London having 114 and 79.7 respectively. If that didn't seem bad enough, it's worse in other areas. In some areas of the United States, passenger cars are responsible for up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions.

Having a lower dependence on cars isn't just good for the enviorment, it's now become ""cool"". The amount of driving done by young people has decresased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, and even big companies are starting to notice. As stated in Source 3, Bill Ford, the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, acknowleged the growing change, and even offered suggestions to help. He proposed a better system to save time and resources while improving gas emissions and public safety. Meanwhile in Bogota Colombia, Millions of citizens in participated""Day Without Cars,"" A yearly program set up in the city.

While 10 years ago might have painted a different picture, the writing on the wall is clear. There's a global trend for decreasing dependency on cars, and it's not looking to stop anytime soon. A once needed tool is quickly becoming less and less relevent, due to cheaper costs, less strain on the enviorment, and the always prevalent ""cool factor."" It's not the golden age of cars anymore, and about time changes were made to match modern day thinking.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
12B6AC349C2F,"A lot of people agree that limiting car usage is a great idea. it can help reduce stress. it will decrease all of the pollution in the air so we can live safer.

With the limitation of car usage it will help pollution all around the world decrease. This will be very useful because we wouldn't need to worry about global warming as much. With less pollution the next generation will be able to live safer knowing there air is not filled with dangerous toxins. This limitation will extremely benefit heavily polluted areas to limit the pollution and probably have the people live longer.

This limitation will also help reduce stress. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,""  says Heidrum walter. This goes to prove that without a car you dont need to worry about car related problems like car jams getting in your way of being late. It will also reduce stress by you dont need to worry everday not to get into a car crash and possibly lose your life.

With the limitation money can be saved. If you dont have a car you dont nedd to pay insurance. Without a car you dont have to pay for gas and that money can be used on other things. Some places fine people just for driving, so not driving would benefit.

As you can see this car limitation can benefit us a lot of way. Saving money, reducing stress, and air pollution is just a couple of great things.                       ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F406397A29A3,"Limiting car usage would not be good for few citizens. Some citizens are just plain lazy and have no sense of being active. But they are good sides of lowering car usage like citizens will have a more open community, citizens will save alot of money throughout the year, and the cities air would be less harmful.

To begin with, Some cities are just known for not having safe communities. But i think limiting car usage will make people interact with one another. The community will eventually join together and everyone will know everybody. Maybe the same neighbor you hate that lives across from you will become your best friend because you guys can walk to the same places together. I think that'll be utopia for cities across the United States.

To add on, They are citizens everyday that struggle everyday just to go to the store to buy some food for the house. I feel like this would save alot of money for citizens and it'll help them spend it on other things they need. I sometimes have struggled on my own to just to make it to school because i don't have any money for gas. I Think this is the main reason why citizens will benefit from the limitation of car usage.

Lastly,Limiting the car usage will greatly benefit the cities air. Some cities in the us have a bad reputation of having alot of air polution. I think after a while the cities will eventually just run on having no cars on the streets because of how good it was the cities air. It'll turn out to be a win-win situation for everyone.

In conclusion, Limiting car usage will first be a hard task to do but it think eventually everyone will adapt to it. Limiting the air pollution, saving alot on gas money, and building a better community are all great factors in this change. They're is many more good factors into doing this but these are just some i thought i should talk about.                             ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

18819BF30DA5,"Driving can be a fun time and a bad time. Driving has its advanteges but there are many disadvanteges which makes people not want to drive. Limiting car usage can be an extremely good thing and there are plenty of reasons as to why thats true. Life will still go on without cars and it might even go on in a better way. People have voted and more have voted on less driving because it is less stressful.

For starters, limiting your car usage means less accidents. United stated has the highest death amount due to car accidents. Almost 80% of deaths are from a mistake made behind the wheel. You never know what might happen when you least expect it, especially when youre just going to a drive to the grocerie store. Alot can happen in 5 minutes, In fact it is proven that most accidents happen within a mile of your home. Limit your driving and save your life as well as someone elses.

Also, limiting your car usuage means saving gas money. On average you soen about $40 dollars to fill a gas tank. That is about $80-$100 in one month. If you save that you will have over a thousand dollars saved in a year. Gas prices raise and drop but are high most of the time, which is a primary reason why people run out of money.

Lastly, limiting your gas usage means getting more exersize. Driving around will not help keep you healthy, in fact almost everyone eats behind the wheel. Drop your keys and walk to your destination. If you walk everyday to where you need to be your body will stay fit as well as expanding your lifetime. Americans tend to be lazy and not go out and exersize but without a car they have no choice. It will increase the amount of healthy people and decrease the fat on your body.

Many advantages come with not driving. It is not something impossible to do, many have done it and many can continue to do it. It will also keep comments from other people held back. No one can judge what your driving whether youre less fortunate or not. It helps keep the community closer, money saved, better health and less accidents.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F62B61EC5742,"Many places such as Vauban, Germany have given up the usage of cars. Vauban is a gworing trend in europe and the United Sates because of the postive effects of not using cars. One of the biggest examples is polution, also the removal of cars would ultimatley lead to a finacial increase in our economy, lastly making this change positivley effects our future.

First I would like to talk about a huge problem we face as a society today and that is green house gasses. You may not think that these are a big deal put if left unchecked they caan become a huge problem. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emisions in europe, and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas. This can become a huge problem ranging from acid rain to climate change. An example of what polution can do to a city is in paris they are putting a partial ban on cars because of how how bad there polution is. There was a huge smog problem because green house gasses were being trapped because of hot days and cold nights.

Also this change can have amazing effects on that areas economy. Because there will be no cars people will take the bus witch is less than payinf for gas or they can walk to closer places. Also gas prices would decrease for other forms of tranpertation because there wouldnt be cars demanding the fuel. family could sell there cars and spend the money they were using to fund there car other thing witch will lead to the people being happier. Also the removal of cars will lead to teh creation of jobd because they will need people to operate public transportation.

Lastly the removal of cars will have a postive effect on the future of our world. With the track were on now the world is estimated to heat up and have negative consequences on our society. these climate changes may seem small but they can have drastic effects. in china there is a lake that is so polluted you set the top of it on fire because there is so much polutants on it. also this chang has coralation with peoples happiness. Were already started down the path of less cars, recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less adn getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

For the following benifits is why we should stop using cars and continue with the idea of using public tranportation and walking. Cars creat polution, its better for our economy to stop the use of cars and this will poitivley effect out furute. Also one last reason for why the beifits outweigh the harms is that we have started the removal of cars all it has shown is positive effects                     ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
2B194FE642E6,"In mostly every city all around the world, we can find cars. Its become a common thing now. But there are a few cities or countries that are going car-free. There are advantages to limiting car usage.

Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. In Vauban, Germany, residents are suburban pioneers, and they have given up their cars. They're allowed to own cars, but there's only one place to park: large garages at the end of the developement. Unfortunately, car-owners have to pay $40,000. So, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. This city is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use.

While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to suburbs. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new 6-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year according to David Goldberg, an offcial of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States.

After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforcewd a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Motorists with an even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or pay a fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the next day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals. Luckily, the smog cleared up enough that day so the ruling French party could rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates the next day.

President Obama's goal is to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, drving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. This has left researchers to think: Has America passed peak drving? According to an analysdis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily since then. Part of the explaination is that unemployed Americans weren't going to work anyway. If the pattern persists, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, jsut behind power plants.

With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. The end of car culture may be on its way. It's not such a bad idea, after all. Bicycles and walking from place to place also promote health and fitness. Breathe happy, live healthy. That's the way to do it.

26E1527FE040,"Cars have been around for over hundred years. They caused some good and bad things. People use cars daily to go places. Now days people have not been using their cars that much. Some advantages, from some texts, of limiting car usage is there will be less car emissions, and less traffic.

To begin with there will be less car emissions. Ever since the first car rolled off the assembly line they have been polluting the air. As seen here ""[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter"" (Duffer). From all the cars and trucks that Paris has, they have the most emissions in their air. Another example will be ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France"" (Duffer). From experance working on cars the diesel engine give off the most pollution out of all the vehicles on the roads today. Since the air in France was getting to bad they had to ""Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at hme or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)"" (Duffer). The smog got so bad in the air that France had to take a good amount of drivers off the roads to reduce their emissions so the smog will be reduced. As a result from parking those drivers ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined"" (Duffer). Today, cars are assories and people need their cars to go to work and cannot blame those people for doing what they had to do. One last example is ""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" (Rosenthal). Since people are using cars less the pollution in the air will decrease. The emissions had gotten to bad and its hurting our Earth.

Lastly is there will be less traffic on the streets. Lately people have not been getting their drivers license.""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" (Rosenthal). The newer generation does not have the disire to drive and to work on cars like the generation before them. Another example is ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent were sold"" (Rosenthal). 70 percent is a high number of people and that is a lot of people that are not on the roads. Since those people are in Germany this is what happen in France ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" (Duffer). That is a huge decrease in traffic there will be no problems getting anywhere on time. Another key example is ""People park their cars in large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home"" (Rosenthal). Since people do not have the money to pay for a parking spot they have to get rid of their cars and that will definatly clear up the roads. One last example is ""Vauban's streets are completey 'car-free'- except the main drag to down town"" (Rosenthal). Vauban's street are compleatly empty now hows that for no traffic.

In closing, cars have been around for a while now. They caused some problems and no problems. People use cars to go places daily. Now days people have not been using their cars that much. Some advantages, from some texts, of limiting car usage is there will be less car emissions, and less traffic.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
58ACC054FF00,"Citizens who own a car should listen closely to the advatages of limiting your car usage. Even if you do not own a car you should listen to this. The usage of cars in big cities have always been a problem to our enviroment but now pollution is at an all time high in the world. Officals have said cars are one of our biggest problems of greenhouse gas emissions.

Not using your car can benefit in your health more than you think too. Like the capital city of Colombia, Bogota, car owners should try the program they did. Columbians used every other use of transportation, like walking, biking, roller skating, or used the city buses to get to their work place. This day was know as the car free day. The program they used was already spreading to other countries but after Colombia did, many other countries started to fallow.

Car owners who do not use their car very much, tend to have a healthier life style than most. They begin to walk, bike, or go to the local bus stop to get to work. Those who do not use their vehicle not only have a healthy life, but they also have more money saved so that they can invest into something better. For example a better house, being able to support their children easier when it comes to school or sports, or they might even have a little extra cash to be able to spend when they want to buy something for themselves.

If the enivroment had a mind of its own, I am sure they would apprecate the things you have done by stopping the use of your car. These may not be all of the advantages to not using your care but these are some that can at least start you off on the right track.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
25003EA91F98,"As we all know cars are a big part of our society today. However cars have a bigger impact than we think. Some people can't live without there car. Some people can go their whole life without a car. We may not think about it however there are multiple advantages to not using a car. When we limit our car use it saves the earth also it i said that it takes away a heap load of stress and it saves people money. Just think about it, one day without the use of cars. How would that be?

We we think of saving the earth we think of recycling, reusing things, and reducing. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.(According to ""In German Surburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" By: Elisabeth Rosenthal). In Paris there pollution was almost record setting and so they ordered that even-numbered license plates leave their cars at home or pay a fine of $31. Almost 4000 drivers were fined that day  and 27 got their cars impounded. Most of the cars in Paris are diesel ran so the smog is worse. If they would cut down on their car use it would lower the smog.

You might not think of it but if we limited the use of cars it relieves stress. According to ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", In Vauban, Germany they have given up their cars. Vaubans streets are completly car free. 70 percfent of Vauban's families do not own cars ansd 57 percent sold a car to move there. Heidrun Walter said""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happierthis way"". According to ""Car-free dat in spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky in Bogota,Columbia they have been without cars for 3 years. Also Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It's a good opportunit totake awat stresss and lower the air pollution"".

According to ""The End of Car Culture"" by: Elisabeth Rosenthal recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as each year goes by. The number of miles driven in the United States  peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily afterwards, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Adivor Perspectives. People who stopped driving there cars as a result of hard times may not find a reason to go back to driving if they are saving money.

So I believe that they're many reason to have a car. However they're many advantages to limiting your car use. You can think of yourself as doing a good deed to the earth when walking somewhere or riding your bike are catching the bus. You can have a clear mind and seize stressing so much. Also you can save money I think that everybody likes to save money one way or another. Instead of drivng your car to the mall you can save that money and catch the bus to the mall and buy that new purse that you have been dying to get.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
06D6C0804BFF,"Cars are a very usable objects in the kind of society that we are living in today. But with great things comes bad things too. The limit of car usage in any places of the world would have an effect on every one . It could be good, it could be bad. But when it comes to the envirenment, limiting car usage can even help prevent certain problems that people don't realy pay attention to. Prolems like pollution and the government wasting money in highways for cars than trying to find safer ways for transportation.

Like many factories, cars give out bad smoke from the pipe under the back of the car. When that smoke goes in the air and get mix with the air, it would create pollution. Now the pollution would create bigger  problems like the rise of the greenhouse gas emission and  it could also create global warming wich could lead to much worse stuff that I would not get into. All you have to know is that global warming could lead to the destruction of the earth.

In France, their government decided to enforce a driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Based on facts cited in source two, the city of paris was near-record pollution. On my personal experiances, I know what car smoke can do to people. One of my uncles died in Haiti because he inhale too much car smoke. It knind of messed up his lungs.

People are suprisinly over the crisis of cars. But apperently the government deosn't realise that, since based on source 1 it stated ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. Bycicles are a much safer way to travel. Though cars are faster, but it is way easier to crash in cars, and bycicles does not release bad smoke that can culminate to pollution .          ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
1E844AC028BE,"Reducing the amount of cars used would benefit the fellow citizens greatly. Limiting car usage would decrease the amount of pollution in the air greatly, because they are among the main causes of emissions into the air among many countries. A better enviroment for the citizens would arise because the infrastructure of many cities would improve and the people would exercise more, therefore becoming healthier. Also, congestian would dramatically decrease because less people would be on the road which also leads to less car accidents so less people would be getting injured from a car accident.

Car emissions all over the world are among the main causes for the air pollution and greenhouse gasses. In cities llike Paris the air pollution rose so much that there was a temporal driving ban on the whole city. This ban eventually cleared the air but if this could happen in one city it is more than likely to happen again in another city. These car emissions are clearly a large part of this air pollution as Elisabeth Rosenthal shows the U.S  has a fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions from the abundant amount of cars. Limiting the car usage would clearly diminish the amount of emissions in the air and prevent these large amounts of smog and pollution to form in the air that the people are breathing.

In the city Bogota a car-free day was hosted to promote public transportation, and it had created many benefits to the city's infrastructure. With more money coming in from these public transportations the government has more money to fix and improve upon the city's infrastructure. The sidewalks were fixed, more restaurants were opened, and more people attended parks, and sports centers. If more cities implemented this car-free program for longer than a day the people would be becoming healthier and the enviroment would be a lot safer with better sidewalks, and better infrastructure in general. Also with these new buildings being created more jobs would naturally also be created therefore unemployment would also be decreasing in the cities that are restricting cars. In Vauban, a city almost no cars, the citizens live happy with a rectangular shape to their city to maintain everything close and a small walk away from almost everything, therefore the infrastructure for the city is clearly well built and no cars are needed.

The restriction of cars would also make the roads a lot safer considering there are less cars to crash into or cause accidents. As shown from the Paris ban on cars, congestion had decreased sixty percent from what it was originally. The only people driving would be the conductors of the public transportation vehicles, therefore a majority of the drivers on the streets would be experienced and not be drunk while driving. The decrease in congestion would also lead to a much more efficient mode on transportation from the busses, and they would travel much faster to their destinations.

With the restriction of car usage the positive benefits created would immensely improve the living conditions and enviroment that the citizens live in. With a cleaner enviroment free of pollution the people would live healthier, infrastructure would improve greatly allowing more jobs to be created as well, and less congestion and car accidents would occur in the cities. The restriction of car ussage would improve the citizen's lives greatly.                    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
704B7078F568,"One of the largest sources of pollution around the world is transportation, such as in automobiles being used in everyday life to get around from point a to point b. Many cities and countries are trying to find ways to decrease the amount of smog and pollution caused by car edmissions. People are finding ways such as banning cars or even having days where a car is not allowed to be used. Finding new ways to decrease the greenhouse effect is a revolutionary way by starting out with automobiles, since it plays such a great factor in many peoples life everyday.

In Vauban, Germany a community has a limited restriction toward cars. Cars are only to be parked in a garage on the edge of the development with a payment of $400,00. 57 percent of residents have sold their car to live in a community where no cars are allowed. Residents claim to be more happier and have felt tense with a car always around. This effort to decrease the number of emissions and now only has Europe responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas, as in the United States it is resonsible for 50 percent. Numbers are dropping in Europe which leads to a healthier enviroment to live in.

Another way,that Cities in Europe have started to take part is, banning cars off the streats of Paris. Paris has a large portion of smog than other European Capitals. Congestion was low during the five- day period that automobiles where banned off the streets of paris. Within the five-day period public transportation was free to get people places. The results of this car banning was a success to clear out the smog which is a risk of endangering a person's health.

Other countries such as Colombia have cities that have a car free day. Bogota is a capital of seven million that have people partcipate in a car free event taken every year. Businessman Carlos Aruto Plaza has claimed that it was a ""good opportunity to take stress and lower air polllution"". Rain also doesn't stop millions of people from partcipating in this event to reduce traffic jams and pollution. This campaign is enticing municipal authorities from other countries to start this revolutionary change that soon may be the future.

Also,car production is steady decreasing in the United States due to less young people getting a drivers licence. Young people do not bother on getting a licence or a car because they have public transportation or either car pool with friends. It has led a 23 percentr drecrease of young people on the road. Not many people go out to meet their friends and rather do it via internet, since technology has been increasing and is another part of daily routines. Cities such as New York have been taking part in a bike-sharing program to reduce traffic in large cities. These new ways to decrease pollution are still being tested but it seems like less people will be off the road and more engaged in less traffic.

Decreasing driving is a major priority to decrease smog around cities and the greenhouse effect. Having car free days and banning cars promotes healthier lives. It decreases the risk of having health problems and stress which can have major effects on one's well being. Supporting communities without automobiles and car free days results in living happier lives. Traffic has decreased and people are left happier breathing in less polluted air.

97F9199ECB5B,"Do you own a car? Have you ever driven one? Many people would answer yes to these questions, and would agree that cars , in fact, are very useful. But have you ever thought of the adavantages that would occur if we limited car usage? While cars are very useful, they also have lots of negative side affects that come along with it. Cars accumulate lots of pollution in the enviroment and stress to humans. Also less cars, results in less traffic, which means you will be wasting less of you're life waiting to get somewhere and actually being there in the moment. Whether you realize it or not Americans are already starting to cut down on car uasge. In the article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it even states ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""

The world has been struggling with pollution for quite some time now and has been trying to come up with ways to cut it down. So why not start with where it derives from the most? Cars. Pollution by cars got so bad in Paris that they had to use license plate numbers to decide what cars could drive on certain days! But what did happen was ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" (Duffer). That is amazing! Just five days of less car usage and the smog went down 60 precent. Pollution would drop in great precentages if we just cut down car usage a bit. Pollution will always be harmful to the world, but steps should be taken to harm the world as little as possible.

Stress is something everyone experiences, but it is safe to say that everyone could do with less of it. Cars cause lots of stress to humans. A city in Germany does not allow cars and a women from the city says ""When I had a car I was always tense."" (Rosenthal). She is much more relaxed now and does not need to worry about all the stress that comes along with owning a car. Another person from Bogota, Columbia, where they have a car-free day, says ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress..."" (Selsky). People all around the world are reporting that their lives are a lot less stress free when they do not own cars. Stress is something that can be very damaging to a human when in large amounts and just cutting down on driving takes away lots of that stress.

Everyone has been stuck in traffic from time to time, and for some people in small cities, five minutes could be a long time to be stuck in traffic. But for some people in big cities like New York City and Los Angelos, people waste hours stuck in traffic! When you accumulate all those hours stuck in traffic, that is a lot of your time wasted in just waiting to get from desitination A, to destination B. Those hours could be spent on actually being there in the moment at the destination you want to be at. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009....."" (Rosenthal), many people now-a-days just want to get to the place that they are going to, as fast as possible; whether that be by car-pooling, taking the bus, or biking. Car usage is already decreasing, but that advantage should be taken that people want to live in the moment more and car usage should be even more cut down.

Car usage may never be completely taken away, but it defintley can be lowered. The advantages and benefits of just less car usage is astonishing. Less pollution to help the world, less stress to help the people, and letting people live life in the moment more are all advantages the derive from cutting down on the usage of cars. It may be diffcult to let go of something many people hold on to so dearest, but it is a change the will benefit us. While cars may have its pros, its cons outweigh it in the end.               ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

The avantages of limiting a car you dont have to pay for any car ticket or parking garage fees.

As a result half of the families don't own cars about 50% of them sold there cars. It somehow made them feel a whole lot better. When you have to think about it your car is an example of a baby.

4915C64AF1EE,"limiting car usage is an advantage for many reasons, for example, the pollution will become less of a problem, people will be less tense, and we will be devoid of traffis jams, which means less car accidents. To me cars are just something to get you to point A to B, but now that I have read these articles I  realize that cars are alot wrose for the enviroment then i thought, and that i should try using of ways of transportation.

In the passage it states ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" The pollution was out of control and for the most part it was because of the huge amount of car usage. The effect of banning car usage was resulting in an amazing outcome, less pollution, which is healthier for the commuitty. The advantage of limiting car usage can effect a whole commuitty and one way is less pollution. Bogota, Colombia had the same idea but they were not banning the car usage they have one day called the car-free day to show that its an advantage not to use cars all the time.

Limiting car usage can even make you less tense, as said in the article,"" ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,""said Heidrum Walter, a media trainerand mother of two, as she walker verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering childern drown out the occasional distant motor."" Everything is better when car usage is limited it, makes you less tense and less pollution."" "" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.""

When there is less cars on the road there is less possiblity of car accidents or traffic jams."" ... leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" During the one day of no car usage, the streets were left of no traffic jams or accidents. The world is a better place with limited car usage. "" Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

To conclude, the limited car usage is a great way to reduce the amount of pollution, become less tense , and creat less possibility to have car accidents or road jams. After reading these article I have realized that taking othe transportations like bicycle or on foot could have huge impacts on the enviroment and my own well being.               ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

hat if we lived in a world with no cars? What are cars really? According to source 4 ""A car is just a means from getting from point A to point B when BART doesn't work."" If this is true then a cars only purpose is to polloute and cause trafic jams and accidents. If more people took the bus or walked or rode their bike to work we would see a steady decrese of greenhouse gasses. Also the less cars on the rode the fewer traffic accidents there would be.

Source 1 states ""Passenger cars are responisible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""

Therefore, without cars polloting the streets the world would not only be a better to live in but a cleaner one as well.

What this quote is showing is that cars only cause unessacary problems for everybody. Plus the less cars on the streets the fewer recless drivers there would be as a result there would be fewer car accidents.

I n conclusion, the limit on car usage can only be possitive. With fewer cars being sold the levels of greenhouse gasses would decrese. But not only that, less cars mean less accidents. Cars only cause problem in the world, whats being 10 minutes late compared to the safty of your fellow man.

There been efforts to make cities better for walking home and to other places. some countries developed increase of numbers of private cars owned and are being used with private parking spaces. It is a huge effect of reducing greenhouse gas if theres not lots of driving 50 percent of some car intensive area are effected. they are starting car reduced communities and legislator just for cautious to limit greenhouse gas from going out.

Many experts  expect public transportation serving to play a big role in the new limiting car usuage. They made the motorist leave there cars at home or suffer a big fine. They did care even if you have a license plate or a odd number plate. They also limited car usuage because france uses diesel fuel  and that was a big impact in western europe.

A car free day was made buses or taxes were the only cars permitted. They used those to ride to work or any other alternative to reduce smog. That was the best opportunity to clear air pollution. Many people from other countries came to see and celebrate the event that was happening. So many bicycle paths were made just because there were no more car usuage that was the most in any amercican city.

Sidewalks were replaced by even better smoother sidewalks even a rush hour started to happen now that the car usuage was limited. That dramatically cut traffic for taxes and any other vehicle that was still in usage. Some people feel more connected over the internet now instead of using there car to go see them all these changes made it  hard to continue the habit of not driving.

We have made some fantastic tecnologies in our desire to move more quickly and extensively. Not many could have dreampt of a day when mankind could ship large cargo from Mexico to Greece, fly large planes full of people across the atlantic, or even what seems so common today, drive in comfort from state to state in short ammounts of time. We enjoy the ability to drive so easily from place to place that almost every single American family owns at least one car, but there in lies a problem.

Seince the big boom of industrial car manufacturing in the early twenteith century America's use of the vehicle has spread from transportation of the high class, to a tool of public transportation, construction, delivery, and overall everyday use. This relationship between man and machine has been a part of our scociety for so long it is practically a part of our lives, but this relationship has taken a toll on the world it was brought into in the form of polution. The basic way an automobile functions is by putting fuel into the system to run the engine and then emmiting that fuel as a gas biproduct, and with such the wide spread use we have of these machines, the ammount of gas biproduct has realy built up. Harmful chemicals in these gas emissions from our automobiles have provided the second largest source of our emissions with only power plants contributing more to the polution of the environment.

There are however some easy ways we could help fix this problem. In other parts of the world this effect is being felt, such as Beijing, China, which is facing a huge problem with polution smog, and certian places have decided to make a change by limiting car use. This limitation of car use can be done in many different ways, and has helped curb a smog problem that arose in Paris. Other places have done this by means of car-free neighborhoods in Germany, or a car-free day in Columbia, and the reaction has been most positive.

These ideas of change for a clean future are helping communities in different parts of the world, so whose to say we can't do it too? We should contribute to the healing of our environment before its too late for the choise. This oppurtunity for change is not one we should let slip by, and it could be a refreshing, enjoyable change.

Not having a car could actually make you a much happier person as well. You would'nt have to worry about spending too much money on gas or even getting into accidents. If you have to go somewhere far, you can just hop on a subway or pay for a taxi. I know, your probaly thinking: Paying for a taxi or paying for a subway ticket cost money but definately not nearly as much as having a car.

Next, without having to drive cars, our air we breath in will be much less polluted then it would be with cars. Paris evenually ended up on banning driving because the smog was so harsh to the environment. Anyone who drove cars were then fined. According to the article

Paris bans driving due to smog

In  source 4, Michael Sivak says ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn.""

People were starting to realize that when they owned a car they would always be tense. After getting rid of the car, they have been much happier and less stressed.

Since there are less cars in the streets of Germany, people have stopped and realized how beautiful everything was. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, is now reilved as she walks the verdant streets where she can hear the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children.

In Paris, France due to the cold nights and warm days, the car emissions have been trapped by the warmer layer of air. Sometimes, weather can be the effect of something bad happening to your car. In the everyday world, people have been killed and have been in serious accedents. Not only because of the weather but also because of the lack of resposibility and concentration it takes to drive a vehicle.

The sounds of children safetly playing amongst themselves and soft chatters of people coinsided with the smell. It seemed like an utterly new universe where we tread, thanks to no more pollution and the ruckus of vehicles beeping and swerving every now and then, the atmosphere was delightful. The advantages of banning cars or at least reducing them is that the carbon dioxide levels will decrease and business will bloom.

To begin with, banning cars/reducing them will benefit our ecosystems and enviornments. Take Paris for example, they banned cars due to all of the smog and pollution it was emitting. Congestion, traffic, was down 60% after five days of intense smog; it was worst than one of the most populated cities in the world, Beijing (Source 2). That CO2 rises into the air, the atmopshere of Earth trapping all of that heat in, and it bounced back down at us. The climate would be more reasonable, there will be a less amount of traffic jams and people being late to work, and maybe some day, our Ozone Layer could replenish. Carlos Arturo Plaza from Source 3 stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" We as a population don't have to completely outlaw driving but more acts of car-pooling and using public transportation will immensely reduce the CO2. We can all be able to give up something for the benefit of the common good, in Bogota, Columbia it has been three straight years that cars have been banned found in Source 3; and they have a population of a wopping seven million. Michael Sivak brings up a good point in Source 4 saying, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Elisabeth Rosenthal states that, ""Mine (19 and 21) [speaking of her children] have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could some in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

Alongside with the bettering the enviornment, there is the sudden blooming of business and profit. With everyone on their feet and searching somewhere to hang , shop owners will be opening for business, and actually take part in the outside world. In Source 3, a valid point is relevant, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restauraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" There will be a fluctuation of revenue throughout all these newly built shops, stores, entertainment centers, and restauraunts. People will be more active with running, walking, and biking around the city/town. In Bogota, Columbia (according to Source 3) new paths have been opening up, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city,"" stated by Mockus the city mayor. An ordinary person, Heidrun Walter, positively commented on the ban of cars, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Consider all the factors of health, one will be fully exercised on a daily basis, there will be little to no car accidents where people have died either in the vehicle or on the sidewalks; DUI, drinking and driving, will not be an pestering issue anymore.

In conclusion, the idea of banning cars is magnificant. There will be less pollution, less traffic jams, more businesses and shops and restauraunts opening to suit our needs, and just overall great for the enviornment. We can all join up together as a union to save our Earth, the Ozone Layer from allowing harmful objects from outer space into our atmosphere, and induce more activity amongst each other. We will all be happier and less irritated without the ruckus of cars and check-up like oil leaks, motor mishaps.

Shoot, we'd probably all be millionares if we set aside our gas money.

Death. Death is a major problem. Due to alcohol and stupidity plus cars equal not very good outcome. Most people aren't even safe when the drive so it's not like cars can drive themselves and not get in an accident.

Here are some ways limited car usage effects the world.

It reduces greenhouse gases. 12 percent of greenhouse gases come from Europe and about 50 percent come from the United States in the car intensive areas that is. if we were to start having limited car usage we could drastically decrease the car emission greenhouse gases by about 50 percent. Paris, France has a partial ban on cars and only lets certain cars drive on certain days which completely cleared out the smog that had been covering the city for a while.

It increases the amount of money the usual gas consumer has. the save a ton of money from not having to refill on gas all of the time.

However, there are other alternatives when is comes to going form one destination to another. Citizens should limit their car usage. It helps with the terrible traffic on the street. Also, there will be no more pollution in the air. In addition, citizens can be able to enjoy the world.

Everyone has been caught in traffic, whether it is going to work or school or meeting up with someone. Everyone has been in traffic before. People can prevent traffic form happening. There is carpooling, it can help limit traffic on the streets. Just like it states in source three, ""...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" There are other ways to avoid and stop traffic. Not everyone needs to take their own personal car to work. They can either car pool or take public transportation to save money because gas isn't cheap these days. In addition, traffic somtimes end up leading to accidents. There are several people who died in a car accident due to someone speeding because he or she doesn't want to wait in the traffic. However, if everyone just finds another alternative way to get to his or her destination, then no one has to die. Just like it explains in proclaims in source four, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety."" This qoute listed some alternatives way to get somewhere. By doing these things it will not only limit the traffic but the resources and the safety of other people. Traffic isn't a fun place to be in, so find another way to get to his or her destination can prevent traffic.

Air pollution is everywhere we go. Whether someone travels to Japan, India, or South America. There willbe air pollution there. It might not have same amount of air pollution as other countries but there is still pollution. Why? Because there are people who uses his or her personal car not thinking about what happens to the air that they breathe. However, there is a solution to limit the pollution in the air. Limiting car usage or find another way to get to the certain destination. Mr. Sivak even claims that ""A car is just a means of getting from A to B..."" Cars is just a means of transportation. So are bicycles, trucks, buses, traind. However, all these have one thing in common, they are all going form destination A to destination B. Biking, walking, skating are some way to stop the gas from the vehicles from polluting the air. Actually, by using these methods pollution can be reduced. For example source three states, ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have bee replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic..."" When people don't use his or her car and decides to find another way to get to their destination it helps reduce the traffic.

There are several people who say that they know what the real world is since he or she travels all the time in their car. However, do people really know the sounds of kids laughter when walking down the side walk or a bicycle bell violently ringing at someone to get out of their way? Not a lot of people know this because they are usually used to their vehicles getting them places. People will argue that they have heard all of those before and that they were happier. But Ms. Walter thinkgs other wise, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Ms. Walter has been walking on the streets and she hears the swish of bicycles and the talkative children and occastional a distant motor. These help people better appreciate the world that they live in because not everything will last forever. In addition to this, less cars means more people walking which means that several people will end up walking pass a shop and look what is inside. For instance in source three is explains, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed through the city; uneven...and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" It helps by walking to find new stores or restaurants people never heard of.

Several people believe that the only way to get somewhere is by car. That isn't necessarily true. Skating, walking, biking, car pooling or public transportation can help get anyone from point A to B. Yes, it will take longer on foot than by car but it helps the environment, it stops from the air getting all the gasoline form the cars. It is faster than being stuck in traffic. Someone who is biking to school can be five minutes late while soneone who is took their car and got stuck in traffic can be an hour late.

However, they could still car pool or even ride a bike and get some exerscie. Also, reducing car usage would help people become more social in their life. They could meet new people and get to know some one if they would ride the public bus. In source 4, Elisabet Rosenthal explains how accients from cars are a mjor cause of death but its so unsafe when you get out on the road. Reducing car usage has many advantages for our live to stress free and safe.

Deminishing car usages has many positive changes to our lives and to our planet. for exapmle, with less cars we would have less pollution being emitted into the air which i killing the atmosphere as we speak, people would be happier with less cars because they dont have to stress over driving and paying full attention on the road and conditions. Less cars would have a more social effect on the live of humans. The positive advantages on reducing car usage are endless!    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
5FCEA1E5F5C6,"Imagine this. A world that caused you to suffocate when you opened your house door. No this is not a water world, just the poison-filled atmosphere caused by the doing of the last century or so. Since cars entered the time of modern technology, pollution began. More and more people purchased cars for their own wishes, desires, and/or conviniences that continously added on to the killing of the world. Now go forward in time. We're in the 1960's. This is the time scientists started to understand that the ozone layer began to appear with holes in it allowing dangerous U.V light to enter. This U.V is causing the water to rise, is now one big source of skin cancer, and many different detromental factors that destroy or will cause the destruction of a panoply of environments. All of this due to a good amount humans not having the energy or the will to find other means of transport.

""In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars."" So is the title of a fantastic article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal which shows that even an area with (I like to say) beautiful cars can survive and thrive rather well. Rosenthal is a fighter against the car epidemic, you can say. Rosenthal writes this article explaining how a small part of germany does not need cars to survive. The opposite, in fact; the survival of that little habitat is becoming powerful on the thriving scale. Rosenthal intelegently implements the opinion of a mother of two in this article. The mother, Heidron  Walter, states "" When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Now, we can all agree that most moms usually have places to be prevalent to their children. As you can see, Haidron seems to be just fine. Not only is Haidron doing well, apparently, but she is now a source of the rehabilitation of this Earth.

Since we're in the area of Europe, what of the beauty and the capital of the world of love; Paris? Well, according to Robert Duffer's article on the pollution of Paris, there was a small outbreak of smog given off. In the very first sentence, I read a jaw-dropping sentnce that said ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Looks like the beauty of Paris was lost. Dont' worry though, your honeymoons will still be available in this city, thanks to that partial ban. In fact, if the smog were to become more of a definite factor in the environment, then it would of broke the record in Paris for that particular reason. Sadly, that was not all that was concluded from this observation; "", after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" concluded Duffer. Incredibly, this did not occur due to the fact that cars were simply at the off position, which is a way of change that you and I can easily achieve.

Enough of the safety of the ozone layer, what about your safety in a car? Did you know that the percentage of you entering a car and driving inreases your chance of getting in a car crash? Pretty obvious but you never thouoght of it that way have you? Now, think of this but the statistic will be towards your child/future child. Everyday, a teenager dies of a head on collision. May it be a drinking problem, texting and driving, or a simple mistake, either way, someone has been lost that day. Families lose a big part of them, a future is lost, an education that could've been used one day. Gone. Rosenthal states in her article ""The End of the Car Culture"" that 23% of young people have stopped driving between the years of 2001-2009. If I was a father, I'd add on to that statistic of 23%, not the other statistic...

You may be a brother, a sister, a friend, a father, a mother, but you are human. As human, it is your responibilty to stop our foe, greenhouse gases and U.V light. The time of gasoline cars have ended and we have entered the era of higher, more environmentally friendly versions of cars. Thes cars are detteriorating the world with malice. Now with the help of all around the world will be much more beautiful. Now, Imagine this. A utopia filled with vibrant colors and vigorously jubilant people on the sidewalks of the world.

98228788A0B2,"umm, maybe we can settle downoff the cars !!, i beleive that can be an good idea for citizens in the united states without cars this can be a better world for me and people in my community and my city , this can help reduce the amount of air pollution from cars and  from other automobiles ,another way  we can decrease the use of cars is by having a car-free week. these ways can make a big change in the way people use cars  in thisx culture.

the reduce in car usage can help people from getting sick from trucks and cars from polluting the air, not only can people get sick but animals such as,dogs cats and some farm animals wat humans eat. the pollution in the air can cause plants to  die what farm animals feed on,for example where i live i saw an horse suffering from  dead plants. also, car pollution  can sometimes cause crashes because of all the smoke from an bad engine or even car that fan can be over heated, for instance one time i was on my way to walmart on a very hot day , all of a  sudden smoke started coming from my mom smoke pipe under the car, the cause of this was because her fan was over heated. there can be many ways an car can cause  pollution in the air thats why we need to slow down on  the car population or usage a day.

air pollution can be a major way fror the president to pass an law about car usage. but,  another way to stop people from using there cars. are by having an week off from cars and big trucks,if we have an week off from cars  more people  would be walking more or riding bicycles. for example, according to the seattle times in the city of bogota  people had less stress from being jammed up in traffic and lower air pollution. ,moreover, this can help because it can slow down the amount of fuel people use in a day. just imagine one week without cars this people can be able to catch the bus instead of driving. without cars people could slive better.

Do you drive or do you know anyone that drive an their car gives off pollution? Do you think we the people all over the globe should just give up on cars.............? Let's see what others think about this?

First off, the way car usage is used today I believe we need to cut back on the car usage because as we the people are polluting the air with more toxic that may one day kill Man Kind. Another reason we the people of this globe shouldnt use car usage is in "" Article one Source 1: ""In Vauba, Germany residents of this upscale community like suberban pioneers for example few soccer moms and executives have givien up there cars"". Why well I believe they have given up their cars because not only of the pollution that they can cause but they as people can also wall place instead of driving to places that were mainly just down the street why use gas when you can just walk. My second reason is why driving in Article 1: ""Vauban, Germany when cars are only allowed in two places in Article one "" Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development"". The differences in Artice two: (My own words) Paris baned driving due to smog is because when you started up your car and it pushes out all that gas pollution afterwards that goes into the car put not knowing were its going someone could in heal that gas pollution and get sick. for instants "" Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has.... atax policy that favors over gasoline"" Let's just these gases is used to make up the car. In Article two""Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in Framce, compared to a 53.3% average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to reuters. Meaning the gas used for cars out of the united states for example like France and Europe uses for then we the people in the united states do.

In Article 3, as I have read in BOGOTA, Colombia the rush-hour restrctions have dramatically cut traffic even the restaurants andupscale shopping districts have cropped up majorally. In Article 4 "" President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse gas emissions"".

596FA7F09075,"Some may say that they need cars to get around. Some people love thier car and could never dream of giving it away. Some also don't care about cars that much. Well in Germany and Paris cars are banned, yes I said banned. Some people may be shocked at this but others not so much. Some may ask how do they get around places? Some might ask so do they just walk everywhere from place to place? Some may ask do they actually like living without a car? Some might not even agree with the whole banning cars thing and may have lots of other questions. Well if you wanna know the answer to those questions well read on. Pay attention while you're reading and as I explain to you why these people think life is better without cars.

Having a car is important to mom's especially to the mom's that have about three or more kids. Mom's have dudies to do including taking sons to soccer ball games. Well a mom in Vauban, Germany got rid of her car. She actullay enjoy being car-free, and get this seventy percent of Vauban's families don't own a car. Also fifty-seven percent of people sold their car just to live there, obvisously more and more people are agreeing with this no car thing, and they would much rather take buses and taxies.

Now am not saying that everyone will agree about banning cars, read on to see how the people in Parris disobeyed the no car rule and what happened to them. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or pay 22-euro (31 USD). The same would apply the next day for the odd-numbered plates. According to an international news agency headquartered in London almost four-thousand drivers were fined. Twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

Some people may not know the real reason that people try to limit car use or even ban it in some countries. Its to take away stress and to lower air pollution. In Bogota, Colombia they had a care-free day and it turned into a big hit. On this car-free day millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses. Leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams. You know but not everyone was willing to parcisepte in this event and those people faced twenty-five dollar fines. This program was set to sprend to other countries and it did. For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event, and they were happy.

In conclusion limiting car usage or even banning cars is a good way takes stress and lower pollution.

Having to drive around alot can put a lot of pressure on a person and the pressure is lifted when they dont have to drive anymore. Air pollution is bad there are already a lot of things polluting the air why not make cars one of things thats not polluting the air. Also there will be less car traffic noone likes being stuck in traffic. I think that limiting car usage is a good thing. It will save us in the long run.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
54B9CFA95D80,"Fellow citizens, cars have become a major role in our daily lives. They have their many excellent uses, however there are advantages of limiting that usage. To name a few are, that it's enviromentally healthier and it's less money you have to spend on them. Now let me explain why it's a smart choice to take advantage of limited usage of cars.

Paris recently (according to source two article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer) came up with a brilliant idea of partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. They took days were only even or odd liscense plated cars would drive or they would suffer a fine. However public transit was free throughout the week. This promoted less congestion and smog which is much better for the enviorment by lowering the amount of pollution in the ozone layer. As well as a cheaper way to commute. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". This shows just how out of hand the smog had gotten but with limiting the amount of cars used they managed to clear over half of it! Making the world greener than before.

Meanwhile in places such as Vauban, Germany, the residents went as far as giving up there cars. (according to source one article ""In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"" By Elisabeth Rosenthal) About 70% of the residents no longer own cars because it's either too expensive to have one on the edge of town and it's generally forbidden in this experiment in the new distirct. They even go as far as to say that it's better without having one. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter,a resident in Vauban according to the article. People in general, especially the younger generations don't use cars or have liscenes in comparison to older people who are more likely to retain their liscenses as the age was shown in research. People now don't care as much as what cars are driven but are more focused to get from point A to point B, it's simply a means of transportation. (In source 4 article ""The end of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal).

When it comes down to it, cars are transportation, but there are plenty of other means of transport that are free or cheaper such as buses, trains, bikes or even car pooling. While at the same time creating less pollution and congestion, making it enviromentally healthier.                                            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

8CB328E9A1BF,"Cars have been an important part of transportation in society for many years. However, in some communities that is changing. Many young people are not getting their licenses and some are giving up their cars. The streets of Vauban, Germany, are mainly ""car-free"" and the suburb only has two places to park cars, at the expense of $40,000. Limiting car usage results in many advantages.

One of those advantages is helping the environment. The article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer explains Paris, France, put a driving ban into effect because of smog rivaling that of Beijing, China. The ban was based on license plate number, only allowing certain numbers to drive on specific days. Eventually the ban was lifited because the smog had cleared enough. Limiting the number of people that used their cars resulted in cleaner air, which is healthier for everyone. If limits were put into effect into other places, that could reduce air pollution, helping the environment. Americans are also buying fewer cars and driving less than previous years. The article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal says, ""If the pattern persists - and many sociologists believe it will - it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the envrionment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"". That is another example of environmental benefits from limiting car use. By utilizing other forms of transportation, the impact a person has on the environment is greatly reduced.

Another advantage that comes from limiting car use is lower stress and better mental health. In the suburb of Vauban, Germany, fifty-seven percent of families sold their cars to move there and seventy percent do not own cars. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Heidrun Walter says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". By not owning a car, a person has less stress and can relax when traveling. There is probably less focus needed when traveling without a car because there is no worry about other drivers. Bogota, Colombia has started the Day Without Cars, the goal being to promote alternate transportation. Violaters recieve fines of twenty-five dollars. In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". People could enjoy the outdoors, without the constant noise and pollution from traffic in the city. That could lower their stress and increase their happiness.

Limiting car use has many advantages, some of which are helping the environment and lowering stress. Some suburbs, specifically Vauban, Germany, are mostly ""car-free"". A trend of buying fewer cars and driving less is also growing in America, which is beneficial to the environment. Plus, the stress of driving a car is taken away when their use is limited.

702FDD64B9D5,"In Vauban, Germany, residents there have a unique way of doing things. They have given up the idea of cars. Even driveways and garages are starting to be forbidden and there are only a few streets in use. Vauban is becoming an example of a growing trend in Europe and is trying to seperate suburban life from auto use.

The cars being used particularly in the suburbs are a main reason greenhouse gases have increased over time. There have been many efforts to make cities denser and better for walking, but now, planners are focusing on the suburbs. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg. The U.S is now starting to promote ""car reduced"" communities and some suburbs are starting to look a little more Vauban-like. Also, the idea of less car use is being spread globaly, even in Paris, France. Fines started to be inforced on citizens that didn't leave their cars at home after a day of near-record pollution. Since deisel gas is favored in France, that became a huge blame along with the cold nights and warm days in France causing the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. In addition to that, France is already one of the top smog-containing European Captials. Despight all of this, there are few exceptions being made.

In Bogota, Colombia, a program had begun that was proposed to spread and inspire. It was their third straight year they banned car use for a day with the exception of buses and taxis. Their main goal is to take away the stress of Colombians and to reduce air pollution. Authorities from other countries even became enthusiastic about the idea and before you know it, the idea caught on to two other Colombian cities. The idea has caught the attention of many, even our president.

Obama stated that he has set goals to lower the United States greenhouse gas emission. This being said, studies have shown that Americans are buying less cars then usual and are not driving as much as we use to. The United States had long been one of the world's biggest car cultures and now the love with the vehicles seem to be cooling down. This has been showing signs that recovery is on its way and the use of carbon emissions has been decreasing.

There are many factors that play in the decrease of car use. People are being connected through social media, suburbs are becoming less apealing, and communicating has become easier with the use of elctronics. The rate of driver lisence have gone down and people are finding more ways to get to places they need to be.     ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B2266B51FEBB,"All around the world, cars have influence our lives for the good or for the bad. Whether that is getting people to their jobs or getting into an accident. Cars have altered our lives and are doing it constantly. Although for a century cars have benefited humans greatly, cars have negative effects and banning cars can help decrease the pollution all over the world, it saves the little resoucers the planet has, and car accidents will occure less.

To elaborate more, countries all over the world are trying new ways to decrease the air pollution as much as possible, whether that is banning cars or restricting them. In Vauban, German cars are restricted and if you have a car it is very expensive to use. In Vauban, 70 percent of families do not have cars, and inorder to move in to the town 57 percent sold their cars. The idea of resticted areas are getting big ,and for Vuaban has 5,500 residents, that shows that people like the idea and will support it. People in the town have claim to enjoy it alot and are happier. In Paris, France their idea to help low the pollutin in the air was to have specific licenses plats restricted on certain days of the week. France had very bad smog and within 5 days the smog decrease 60 percent. In Bogota, Columbia they had similar goals as other countries like Germany. Carlos Arturo Plaza said,""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""  In Europe cars make up 12 percent of the greenhouse gas and air pollution. In the United States Americans are driving less and the pollution in the air is decreaseing, benefiting the enviroment. Throughout the world, countries are tring to help the world, by decreasing the pollution.

Moreover, throughout the century cars have been using non renewable resoucers and now that alot of the people have cars, it has taken a toll on the enviroment. The world has only so much resoucers and once its gone it is gone, it takes time for them to come back and it willl not be in our life time. Using these resoucers have a negative effect they emit carbon in to the atmosphere creating greenhouse gas, that is bad. saving the resoucers and not using them can help with keeping the atmopshere cleaner.

Now people are banning and restricting cars for various reasons, but one reason is that for the past century cars have killed alot of people. It is one of the top reasons for deaths  in the United States and possibly in the world. If banning cars can save thousands of lifes why not do it. Banning cars or restricting cars means less cars which can result to less car accidents. Having less accidents results to less people getting hurt and potenially dying. Less cars can also mean that the goverment does have to focuse on roads and stuff like that ,but can focuse on improving the safty of the people on the sidewalks or at playgrounds. the funds can go to better causes.

The world we live has changed enormously and now inorder to save the plant and the people in it, we must make changes as a society, inorder to live long and healthy. Banning cars might be one of the many choices we must make inorder to live. Banning cars can help decrease the greenhouse gases, conserve the resoucers, and less people will die from car accidents.

7563AFFB29BF,"For many years countries like the United States, France, and Germany idolized the cars that they managed to manufacture. This so-called ""love affair"" between people and their cars, though, has started to diminish, and it may be for the better. In the past, the people who owned the prettiest, loudest, and coolest cars considered themselves to be at the top of an automobile social structure, but now, new generations are starting to move away from buying cars. They've resorting to walking, bicycling, or taking a form of public transport. Sure, owning cars may make you ""better"" than everyone else, but at what cost?

Carbon dioxide emissions are at an all-time high, meaning that cars are harming the world more than helping it.

Yes, cars will be continue to be seen as cool, and owning cars will continue to be seen as cool, but nevertheless, with green house gases emitted from the tailpipes of cars ripping holes in the Earth's atmosphere, cars seem to be more of an impediment to the cause than an improvement.

Countries in Western Europe such as Paris and Germany have recognized that the exponential amounts of smog produced by cars are becoming dangerous. Legislators everywhere are taking cautious steps towards eliminating the gases that have a choke hold their cities. An official of the Transportation for America, David Goldberg says ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" (Par. 7, Rosenthal). Cities in Paris and Germany are adopting a similar idea- developing cities than have a ban cars.

Vauban, Germany is one of these cities, dicouraging their 5,500 residents to give up their cars, charging them $40,000 to be able to park in one of the two garages in the city. As a result of these rules, 70% of the families that live in Vauban don't own a car, and 57% sold a car in order to live there (Par. 3, Rosenthal). The citizens are reported to be happier and less tense without a car, claiming that cars were the cause of their stress.

Communites like Vauban are set up in a way that makes life easy for the car-less citizens. In this approach, stores and offices are placed within walking distance from the houses, rather than in malls along some distant highway (Par. 6, Rosenthal). This has effectively reduced the amount of emissions of green-house gases drastically in Germany, and other countries around the world are starting to adopt Vauban's basic precepts in an attempt to make cities more compact (Par. 6, Rosenthal).

Paris, France is one of these cities that is revolutionizing its transportation. Paris has more smog than any other European counry, with 147 micrograms of particulate matter in the air, compared to 79.7 micrograms in London (Par. 17, Duffer). The smog rivaling that of Beijing, China, attempts were made by the government to reduce this smog, fining motorists for two days if they were found using their cars. France, having tax policies that favored the use of diesel over regular gas, blamed diesel fuel for it's record pollution levels.

Bogota, Colombia ran into a similar problem with it's high numbers of carbon dioxide emissions. The country has developed an atmosphere improvement campaign in the 1990's, constructing hiking and bicycle paths to encourage people to go ""car-free"". For the Day Without Cars, alternative transportation like taxis, buses, and bicycles are promoted, and violators that use their cars on this day are fined $25. Despite the constant rain, participants still turned out, claiming that ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away the stress and lower air pollution,"" (Par. 24, Selsky).

Other cities in Colombia have joined the event such as Cali and Valledupar. The mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, hearing about the revolutionary event says ""These people are genertaing a revolutionary change, anf this is crossing borders,"" (Par 26, Selsky). Since the Day Without Cars' institution, parks and sports centers have prospered, sidewalks and roads have been repaved, and traffic congestion has been dramatically reduced (Par. 28, Selsky). The appeal of car culture is decreasing, and it has effected countries all over the world.

An ""incipient shift"" in American's behavior over the last few years sugests that the American people are driving less, buying fewer cars, and getting fewer licenses every year (Par. 29, Rosenthal). The number of miles driven by Americans peaked in 2005, and has been diminishing steadily after that. Due to the recession, the majority of Americans couldn't afford to buy new cars, meaning that less people were driving.

Mimi Sheller, a sociology professer states that, ""Different things are converging which suggests that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" (Par. 35, Rosenthal). What she says is true; carpooling, van and public transportation services, and bike-sharing programs are the most populat they've ever been. Shifts in the population of drivers may accelerate the current trend, and the ""cash-strapped"" Americans that can't afford a car may never actually have to buy one.

The teenage and young adult population has been affected by this cultural shift aswell, with many teenagers not bothering to get a liscence. They figure out other ways to get around, and revolve their schedules arounf where they can walk or which friend they can ride with. Driving by young people is at an all-time low, dropping by 23% between 2001 and 2009 (Par. 41, Rosenthal). Many young people are adopting the ideas that owning, or even driving vehicles is impractical, or even undesirable. This mind-set, in turn, is reducing green house gas emissions unintentionally.

Over the years car and culture trends have changed multiple times, and this trend occurring now is probably the best one yet. Reducing carbon dioxide and green house gas emissions is very important, and this current philosophy and outlook on cars is aiding the elimination of those harmful gases. ""Pedestrain, bicycle, private cars, commecial and public traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" (Par. 43, Rosenthal). Overall, this idea is helping the Eath, unlike the many ideas before it. Limiting car use has had a positive effect on the world, and has been advantageous in many countries  in helping them revitialize their cities.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
3BB79F3AEADB,"Cars, they are a part of alot of peoples everyday life. They alow you to get around easly whenever you need to, but what would you do without them.

This may sound crazy but ""57 percent [of Vauban's families] sold a car to move [there]"" and ""70 percent [] do not own cars' (source 1). One of the reson pepole do this is to reduce there emisions to help the enviroment.

Emisions can ahave a drastic effect on citys because, many people driving in a small area can lock the gases in the city causing smog. In Paris ""[a]fter days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air ... On Monday motorist with even-numbered licence plates were ordered to leave their cars at home... the same would apply to the odds the next day"" (source2).

Places like Bagota, Colombia ""cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permited for the Day Without Cars"" (source 3), where people enthuaicticly use alternitive transportation to get to work. For some people not driving relives stress, a bussnes man living in Bagota says ""[the day without cars is] a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (source 3).

Even though cars may seem like an important part of out society today, a cultural shift may be leading america away from cars. ""The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter"" (source 4) so even though you may depend on youer car every day in a couple of years cars may not be the main transportation for the US. So you may want to start thinking about using other forms of transport because the age of the poluting cars is coming to an end.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

If they limiting car usage there's going to be less smog in the world because in the second story it stated  that, ""cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"". That means when you keep driving your car and it cold or warm the warmer layer in earth trap the car emissions. And its hurting the earth. Also, in the second story it said that ""the smog cleared enough Monday for ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"". They use less car in French becuase they had ordered motorist with even-numbered license plates to leave they car at home.

More people going to play sports and excersise, because alot of people not going to want to pay alot of money for a car and a place to park it. in the first story it sated that ""A car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. Not everybody going to want o pay that much money for a car sapce with the house. Also,it stated that ""As a result, 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move her"". That tell me a car is really expensive and not alot of people got enough money to buy a car, they would walk instead of driving.

It's better too walk,ride a bike instead of drive a car, because when you drive a car its releasing smog in the air and that's bad for our health. The air the car release's can get us sick. Alot of people rather ride a bike or walk.""it's a good opportunitty to take away stress and lower air pollution"". that means walking help u alot if you stressing you can take a walk its going to take away your stess and its going to be less air pollution on earth.

BFB4A021437E,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. It is better for the environment, it is safer, and it cost people less in the stuggling economy.

To begin, limiting the usage of cars is a advantage because it is better for the environment. For example, ""...Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" (Duffer). It is sad that there is so much pollution in the air that car usage has to be stopped in order for the smog in the air to decrease. After five days of smog, congestion was down by sixty percent in the capital of France. Obviously, limiting car usage is extremely better for the environment.

In addition, the less you use cars, the safer your community is. For example, Heidrun Walter ""...walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chattering of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor"" (Rosenthal). Children coul not be wandering aroundif there were cars on the road. There are accidents all the time where children and adults get struck by cars even when they are trying to be safe. Obviously, if cars are not on the road, it will be safer for everyone.

Finally, limiting car usage saves people money. Actually, ""...Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (Rosenthal). The less that cars are used, the less gas people have to pay for and so they will save their hard earned money. If people stop using their vehicles, then they will be more likely to sell the car, and then they will make money in the long run. If the trend continues, fewer and fewer people will use their money to buy cars. Clearly, limiting car usage allows people to spend less money.

To conclude, limitng the usage of vehicles as transportation is an extremely good idea because it is better for the environment, it is saer, and it costs people less money.         ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E3F8BA7C92D1,"Almost every American has a car. Just go outside and look at your neighborhood.. I'm almost positive if you were to look everyone woukd have a car except for maybe 1 or 2.. The car is in our everyday use basically.. It helps us get to work, run aarons, take kids to school, etc. Now you may seem like theres only 1 risk of being in a car, but believe it or not.. When your car is on and running you're hurting the air.. Now I know the air doesn't have feelings! But logically you're hurting the air and yourself. America should limit car usage for simple reasons like air pollution, car accidents, and lazyness. These are the things we should focus on when we're in our cars or when we talk about saftey because all those reasons fall into that category. Small changes would be nice and helpful here. It reduce alot of problems we have, and stress.

To kick this off, limiting the usage of cars would reduce the amout of air pollution that we are surrounded in now. Think about it millions of cars on and running everyday, sometimes if you look closely thers black gas coming out of the exhaust pipe.. And you're breating that? Out of millions of cars where do you think all those fumes go? they don't just dissapear! We're breating it! sure you might say ""So if im breathing it doesn't that mean i should be dead?!"" no.. that's not the case.. Yes it's bad for you but it hurts the earth mostly the gases break apart the atmosphere we have around to block other fumes from other places out. Think of the earth as a hamster in a ball.. The hamster is the earth and the ball is out atmosphere. The holes in the ball are the holes made from the gases that are released from our cars. This could let any type if gas in. In places like China there's a huge problem caused by all the cars.. it's called smog. Think of fog all over the place but its black and smells really bad. Not only that but it's really bad for you. You may think why don't we have that here? Well China is the most populated country in the world and almost everyone has a car. China is a pretty busy place you'd imagine because of all the people. Well you're right.. All the fumes coming out of those cars cause all that smog to contaminate everything there. Like water, animals, food, and even you! It's very bad. China needs to limit the usage of their cars in order to stop problems like that because it can effect everything around them. We should start worrying about the smog aswell because America is a pretty big place and all the busy cars can cause something similar to a smog, it may not be as big bu it will still cause damage. With all this said hopefully you understand what air pollution does and how we can reduce it.

Moving along, Car accidents is a very big thing everywhere it causes thousands of deaths and injuries. We can stop all of it if we can limit the car usuage. you may say ""We can also just stop teens from driving.."" well yeah you can do that but how will they learn for themselves? Small rules metioned in the article are very interesting like cars with even licence plates were allowed to drive on mondays for example, and cars who drove with odd licence plates were fined for not obeying the law. On Tuesdays it would be the same but for odd licence plates. I think if this rules was implemented atleast 2 times a week it would help reduce the amout of accidents. There wouldn't be asmuch cars and it will be alot safer for people to drive. Sadly in alot of accidents they are fatal in highways, just imagine hundrends of thousands of cars driving in 3-4 lanes, you hit a car and it will obivously start a big problem from there. Think of it like dominos stacked in a line you knock one down and it just starts all tumbling in order. Yeah some cars avoid it but not always. The less the cars the less the accidents. Altough this is off topic but limiting the amout of cars on a freeway or highway per hour will limit the amout of accidents aswell. Back to the point, America needs to do something about the cars or it will just keep happening the more the drivers the more the danger out in the roads and highways. Hopefully this helped you understand more about the limiting of car use a little more.

We're almost there, how ever we should stop revolving our selves around our car. If you live 10 minutes away from a supermarket or small convienience store just walk there.. You're just wasting money and polluting the air driving there.. A bike is a great way to get there you go decently fast, you don't get tired as much and it's a good exercise. We should stop getting to lazy because it is affecting both us and the earth very negatively. I would understand if you're in a hurry but seriously.. If you're 10-20 minutes walking distance why not just walk there.. You don't only exercise in the gym, get some fresh air outside.. well partially fresh air.. Yeah you get the point.. We need to get our butts up and walk places because our car isn't our only source of transportation! It's not just hurting you! Don't forget your purse or wallet! Because it has a big impact on that to with the gas prices going all over the place right now. Something people don't see when they're driving there car is what there doing to the enviornment, yeah i've mentioned it many times but it something we really need to look at because it effects your health tremendously. If you actually take the time to walk or bike to where ever you want it feels nice to actually walk and stretch your muscles out. We need more car reduced communities so that we don't just use our cars all day to get to places not to far away.

To conclude, we need to start limiting the usage of cars in order to reduce alot of problems in our enviornment. Most of our enviornmental problems revolve around something we use everyday which is the car. Problems such as air pollution, car accidents, and lazyness. These things just don't effect you, if effects everyone including the envornment. This is something we should look out for ecause it is a very negative thing we have. Mainly air pollution because that affects everything.. And i mean everthing... Food, water, animals, plants, and even you.. So we all should look out for this and be a bt more responsible. We need more laws to help reduce the amount of smog and greenhouse gases that we have here today in our world. Hopefully you read this and learned alot about the importance of limiting the usage of cars and how it can effect everything.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

F9766C2AA007,"To begin with, is that reducing advantages of limiting car usages can help reduce the 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and reduce 50 percent of the gas in areas like the United States. We must lessen the space for parking so instead of stores along a distant highway you can actually just walk to the store. 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

We have to try harder to make the United states more like Vauban.

Then,

We need to get rid of cars to help get rid of pollution. Cars also causes smog, which we can get rid of if we reduced the usage of cars. Also so many cars causes congestion and a lost revenue in delivery companies. A good idea would be to fine the people like Paris did to reduce so many cars on the street.

Next,

The goal would be to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. So only buses and taxis would be permitted for the time being without any cars roaming the streets. Also any violaters will be faced a $25 dollar fine. This idea would be a really good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. We could also build bicycle paths to help travel. We could also have restrictions which could dramatically cut traffic.

Finally, if we got rid of cars it would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities. It is said that young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

DF2BE9E97393,"Ever since it was first invented, the automobile has proved to be very important and practical for people all over the globe.  In the current century, however, the demand for the car has begun to see a potential disappearance, as  people are beginning to discover that there are advantages to minimizing their dependence on their vehicles. Limiting car usage has several very influential advantages, such as increasing mental health, reducing air pollution, and eliminating problems associated with traffic.

First of all, studies have proven that the use of automobiles is linked to the levels of stress and unhappiness that people feel. Source one elaborates on this by discussing a city in Germany that decided to give up cars. It quotes a woman who says that when she had a car she was always tense, but living in Vauban (the car- free city) has made her much happier. She is able to walk or bike everywhere that she needs to be in town. This opportunity to increase happiness is also mentioned in source three, which quotes a businessman who says that limiting car usage is ""a good opportunity to take away stress."" The alternative he choses is to ride a tandem bike with his wife. This allows for more bonding with his wife as well as increasing their physical health, which plays a vital role in mental health as well.

As of recently, the impact that cars have on the enviroment has gained more attention as well as increased concern. All vehicles emit greenhouse gasses, which are very harmful to the enviroment, causing smog and damage to the atmosphere. According to source one, limiting the use of passenger cars could reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50 percent. Source two describes how the accumulation of smog in Paris became so bad that it caused official bans on the use of cars. It took an entire week of restricting car usage to get the smog to clear up. Source four also agrees that the results of limiting car usage would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment. Source one mentions that as a result of all of this, the Enviromental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting car reduced communities.

Lastly, limiting car usage eliminates all problems associated with traffic. Traffic creates many problems for people, from increasing danger to wasting time. Limiting car usage would immidately reduce traffic substantially. This could prevent people from being stuck on their way home during rush-hour every day.  Having cars speeding by, in residential areas especially, increases the level of danger for pedestrians. There are many casualties that happen every year due to automobile accidents. Limiting car usage would easily eliminate this problem. It would also eliminate the problem of drunk driving and the dangers associated with it. Source four supports this claim by stating that limiting car usage would in fact improve safety.

Limiting car usage has many advantages, and therefore should definately be taken into consideration. Doing this would not only increase mental health and wellbeing, but would also save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.                  ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Two, is that it promotes the use of bicycles and/or public transportation. Three, you really don't need your car anyways. Those are the reasons why I say that it would be good to limit car usage.

My first reason why I say we should limit car use is because of the greenhouse gases we are releasing into the air. In article, ""In German Suburd, Life Goes On Without Cars"", paragraph 5, it says, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United Sates."", which means that 50 percent of the greenhousse gases that we release comes from cars.

My second reason why we should limit car us is because if we use cars, we would use something else to get around like a bicycle. And if we use a bicycle we wouldn't be releasing any greenhouse gases.""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bycicle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor."" stated in article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". This is prety much encouraging us to use bicycles instead of cars.

My third and final reason why we should limit our car usage is because we really don't need cars. We only use our cars to get us from place to place, stated article, ""The End of Car Culture"", paragraph 40 which says ""A car just a means of getting from A to B when BART deosn't work."" And why use a car, when you can use public transportation instead.

To begin with, Theres many differnt ways people look at cars. Some look at it as to juss get you from point A to point B some look as collectable items some dont even see the value of a car but at the end of the day most cars are giving off gas thats polluting the air. As a kid were told pollution isnt good and as teens and adults were well aware that to much isnt good for our atmosphere but we still dont do anything about it. in china (paris), A high level of pollution hit the city and due to that they enforced a ""partial driving ban' to clear the air. setting the example other cities enforced acts to help clear the pollution out the air and as a result the ""smog"" had cleard in time. After that many cites around the world did different thing to reduce pollution.  for example in bogota colombia a programed held a ""CAR FREE DAY"" were people rode bikes skated and took buses to work.

Motor run vehicles play a huge role in peoples lives today helping them get from point A to point B in a lesser amount of time then walking or even riding a bike. However cars are not always the answer, if a destination is less that five minutes away it isn't imossible to walk/ride a bike, when you take the oppurtunity of not driving in a vehicle you are doing two things saving the environment because there will be no gasoline burning and you will be giving your body the exercise it needs.

They did that for five days. 4,000 people were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded due to there reaction to the fine. A car being droven every other day helps out with the polution. it cuts back on the polution if it's not running putting it in the enviorment.

Instead of driving yourself to work ask your co-workers to switch days with you. Some days you drive them to work and other days, they drive you to work. You both would be saving on gas and putting less polutuion in the air. People from the ages 16- to 39- years-olds are just getting thier license, while older people maintain their license was the research Mr. Sivak's has found. Many people just get jobs where they can walk to work, use public transportation or car pool with friends.

Walking, riding a bicycle, hiking, and skating are all ways to get somewhere without creating polution. If there is a way to cut back on polution then you should take that oppertunity. Car-pooling with a friend, or co-worker is also a way to cut back on polution. Instead of two cars coming from an area to go to the same area they should just use one car to go to that area instead of taking to cars for it.

9B2952E23454,"""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""(source 2). Cars have been a great help to people but now their boarding the line of help and hurt. The advantages of limiting car usage almost never end. There's always a way for you to limit your use of your car. It's great for the plant. Also it brings ease to you. Then last is that it brings people together.

To began with is that it's great for there plant. For example in Bogota, Colombia every year for three years they would have a car free day. That is when everyone would leave their cars at home and use a bike or some alternative transportation to get to were they have to be. If you choose to do the opposite then you would be fined a $25 fee for using your car. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This also happens in Paris, were they banned cars because of smog. Even if the fee was $31 dollar Almost 4,ooo drivers were fined.

In addition to that is that it brings ease to you. Stated in the first source, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Heidrun Walter said that. When you don't have to think about any car problem you worry less. Even now there has been a decline in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-old's getting a licenses. It's not a priority anymore. With cars comes worries, and people today don't want any worries.

Last but not last is that it brings people together. Usual when we are driving in our cars we hardly look to see who's driving next to us. But if you take out the cars you can really see wants around you. Meet people while you ride your bicycles. You would see the world in a different way.

In conclusion, limiting cars would benefit you in so many way. One like bringing you closer to the people around you. Also without as many cars it would help the plant. Last it would bring ease to you. Overall the less the cars the better everyone and everything should feel.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
7D17EF70FE11,"Vroom,vroom cars go by there are cars every where people like there cars some people go to work in them others just like to ride in them. But do you think cars are good for the enviroment do you think we should have them every where we go or just for important things like work. Well people are trying to solve that problem by inventing new cars like ''the eletric car'' or ''the solar power car'' but people dont have the money to buy those things. Or should we just not have cars for a day just like in BOGATA,Colombia where they did not use there car for a day and people around the city were walking and rideing bikes to work. i think there should be a day where America should not use cars and then we could see how people react to how they think of that and say if they liked it or not. Because people in America are buying less cars and are driving less and i think we should keep it that way.

People in VAUBAN,Germany residents of a community are not useing cars and people like the idea there ''they think that its safer and they are less stressed'' you could have a car but it will cost u a fortune $40,000 just to get a car and a apartment with a garage to put the car in. But ''some people sold there cars just to live in that community'' but are happy there in the community there lives 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. so wat i think we should do is use are car less and save the enviroment from pollution and start doing what contrys like VAUBAN,Germany or paris, and BOGATA,Colombia are doing makeing this world a better place.

AE231385B80A,"Have you ever woken up one day and thought what life would be like without cars. Can there be advantages to limiting car usage? There have been people studying this and wondered what life would be without cars or trucks. In Paris they enforced a law that stated on monday motorists with even-numbered liscense plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or pay a 22-euro fine. The same rule would apply for even numbered liscense plates the next day. The reason that Paris did this was because they had days of near-record pollution, and banned cars to help ""clear the air"" of the global city.

Would limiting car usage for america be an advantage? No it wouldnt, you know why. The reason being is because there are alot more americans not making money or not trying to make money, Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Whether if thats because of americans not making enough income to purchase new cars or teens and adults prefering to take the tram or a bus as said by Mr. Sivak whose son lives in San Francisco and has his own car but takes the Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though it takes longer than driving.

Limiting car usage is also starting to become an advantage in other countries as well. In Bogota, Colombia they had a day without cars, and people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. Like in Paris they're goal was to reduce smog, and if they violated the rules they were fined a whopping $25. A businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said,""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""Also parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city;uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.

When its all said and done research shows that there are advantages to limiting car usage. Some countries are taking the extra step to try and solve the problems of pollution in they're country. Paris for example are giving people that are out driving on monday with odd number liscense plates a 22-euro fine, and the same goes for even on the next day to help with they're problems with smog. Even in america teens and adults would rather take the tram or the bus, being able to drive isnt a priority to some people in america. In Colombia they have a day without cars and they're goal as well is to reduce smog and pollution in they're country, and giving $25 fines to those who don't follow the rules. So overall it would be an advantage to limit car usage.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
C3583FE28FF0,"Limiting the use of cars seems like a crazy idea but if you really think about the importance of cars now a days does not seem like a big deal. People are starting to realize that cars are not the only way of transportation. According to the article, the number of people driving tend to decrease every year(Source 4 (S4) paragragh 41 (P41) ). On the other hand driving can be more beneficial than walking or riding a bike at times. The purpose of the essay is to explain the advantages of limiting car usage.

For all you nature lovers, limiting cars would seem like a good idea. If more people walk or ride bike's, the percent of air pollution would lower(S1 P5). In the United States, it is proven that up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas is caused by cars(S1 P5). Cars can be very dangerous if they are driven by the wrong people. Driving under the influence can cause many accidents because drivers tend to go to fast or drive really reckless while intoxicated.

Choosing to walk or ride a bike instead of driving can be more benefical because of the amount of exercise people can get out of it. One con to driving is having to worry about traffic(S3 P20). When not driving you do not have to worry about anything slowing you down. There are many advantages to walking instead of driving that many people do  not realize. For example, when walking you do not have to deal with bad parking, being fined for bad driving, or even washing your car which can be a hassle at times(S3 P21).

On the hand, there is nothing wrong with driving at times. A car can be more useful than walking when it comes to going long distances. Now a days everybody is always in a rush and based on where you need to go a car can get there at a faster rate. Accidents can still happen while walking or riding a bike just maybe not as frequently. People can even use smart cars if they are so worried about air pollution(S2 P18).

To wrap things and get to the point, driving less cars can be more benficial. Walking and riding bike's and avoid less traffic and accidents. The percent of greenhouse gas caused by cars would probably go down and air pollution would not be such a big problem. Another benefit of walking is getting exercise. While cars do cause many problems as far as pollution and accidents, they are not a bad idea.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
389A17CB27FA,"A relevant topic in today's society that many people often discuss is the reduction of motor vehicle use. Limited use of vehicles such as cars, buses, and trucks can have great effects on the environment. Most of the effects are beneficial to the environment such as the reduction of smog which can ameliorate the horrible impact we have already had on the environment.

According to source 1, limited use of of motor vehicles will be less harmful to the environment. Twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from passenger cars. This may not sound like much, but it adds up, especially when you factor in the gas emission from the United States which is more than four times what it is in Europe. Source 1 also claims that less use of motor vehicles will lower people's stress and will make children more social because they will be able to play near the streets without having to worry about being hit by a car.

All of these sources claim that motor vehicle reduction will also reduce smog and greenhouse gas emissions. One source that supports this claim is source 2, not only does Paris emit more greenhouse gases than any other city in Europe, they now have two days in which people who drive their cars are subject to a 22 euro (31 U.S. dollar) fine.

Bogota, Colombia is proving to be the most successful in attempting to lower greenhouse gas emission. According to source 3 car-free day has been started in which citizens may not drive their vehicles without being subject to a twenty-five dollar fine. Most citizens obey this law and the amount of traffic jams is reduced to empty streets other than public buses. The increase in amount of people riding their bikes caused sidewalks to be repaired and replaced which improves the aesthetics of the city. Several small restaurants and various other businesses saw an increased income. Along with sources 1 and 2, source 3 claims that citizens are less stressed when not driving a motor vehicle. Along with this statement. source 3 also claims that people will begin to be more socially active when they are carpooled to school and other places.

Source 4 takes place not in Europe, not in South America, but in our own country, the United States of America. In the last few years, the United States has seen a decrease in the amount of people driving motor vehicles. We have not, however seen a decrease on our impact on the emission of greenhouse gases. This is because though people are driving less, many people in this country drive large, gas guzzling Hummers and trucks which emit more gases than any other vehicle. If people stopped driving those vehicles, we would definately see a decrease in greenhouse gases. We've seen it happen in Europe because large personal transport trucks are seldom driven in Europe.

Many advantages will be seen when the act of driving a motor vehicle becomes rarer. These advantages include our emission of greenhouse gases, improved social interactions, people who are less stressed, and an overall more cheerful environment. Multiple sources make these claims, and many countries in Europe such as France and countries in South America have placed certain days in which citizens don't drive cars. These days have proven many of these claims that support the assertion that there are multiple advantages to limited car usage.                                ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
2249A7CAC7EA,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Imagine walking out into a world of smoke, dust, and fog; finding oranisms exstinct or hiding. This is a glimspe of our future. If we do not conrol car usage in our days today this is what it will come to. Limiting car usage has a plethora of advantages.

In Vauban, Germany, past car owners have given up their veihicles for a better life. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' sad Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the clatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.""(

""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars""

by Elizabeth Rosenthal Paragraph 3 Lines 20 through 25). Many people have given up their cars and homes to move to this upscale communtity. It is an example of a trend to separate suburban life and auto use.

There are efforts going on right now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Twelve percent of those emissions are from passenger cars and up to fifty percent in car-intensive areas in the United States.

According to the article

""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog""

, Paris, France has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of a near-record pollution. People who were motorists or drove licensed cars were ordered to not drive or they were to pay a fine of $31(22-euro fine). This did not stop most of the people however, because four thousand drivers were find, and 27 of them had their cars impounded for how they reacted upon this.

Paris typically has more smog. Having limited car usage enabled the congestion(car traffic) to go down 60 percent in Paris. Even though after this enforcement of the driving ban made delivery companies coplain of lost revenue, there were agreements for hybrids and cars carrying three or more passangers.

Imagine walking outside to the fresh air while feeling a rose petal on a near-by bush and watching a squirell and blue jay up in the trees. The neighbors are getting on their bike to the lake across town. All is happy and clean. This was due to limiting car usage in not just Paris and Vauban, but everywhere.                    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
3AAF5AE486B2,"Attention my fellow citizens, we should limit car usage  because limiting car usage will release stress, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, and stop smog.

First, we should limit car usage because driving a car can be stressful. For example say you just got finished with a hard day of work and it was not the best day, You hop in your car and when you start to drive you look ahead and see a trafic jam. After working all day, getting in a car to wait hours and hours to get home is not peaceful or fun. Another example would be when you're on the road and the people around you are not driving safely. ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happeir this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two.(In geram suburb life goes on, paragraph 3)

Not only does the usage of cars cause stress but it also causes greenhouse gas. The use of cars should be limitted because we could drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (In geram suburb life goes on, paragraph 5) Using a car to get around is nice but isint living on earth better than driving a gas powered vehicle and slowly destroying the earth? ""All of our development since World War II has been on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transport for America.(P7)

Finally, We should limit the usage of cars because if we do we can stop smog. Smog is pollution that creates clouds all around and it is discusting and horrible for the earth. 'Bejing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""(Paris bans driving due to smog, Paragraph 14) After intensifying smog, congestion was down 60 percent and thats only after 5 days thats incredible!

All in all, we should limit car usage because if we can use cars less than we do, it will ease stress, reduce greenhouse gas, and finally clean the earth. What do you say, use your car less and get some exersize? Thanks for reading my fellow citizens.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
ACFFAB81C16E,"""Vauban's streets are completely 'car-free'--except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community."" WHAT? I would never want to give up my car for anything. Yes maybe there are some advantages to living in a virtually car free zone but there are some downfalls as well.

Many kids play sports and neeed a car to get the to their practice or game because the walk is just to far. I drive to Clearwater, Fl every week to get to practice and I know i would not be able to walk that far with all my equipment in time. My life, as of many others, revolve around cars and count on them to get them to where they need to go. It's crazy to me how it says that ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars..."" I guess it is possible to live without a car.

Yet it is a good thing that more communities and cities are starting to do this to try and help the environment. Cars produce so much green house gases and that's why the environment is having such a hard time right now. All the gases that we produce such as cars, just get thrown up into the solar system and destroy our solar system. One woman that lives in this community stated ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" It proves that you don't need your own personalo vehicle as it just causes stress. If it's working for these people, it will begin to work for more communities that are changing to be like this and possibly, all communities will be like this.

FA721F8FFB50,"Have you ever took a vacation into a large city to see someone you know, or live in one yourself? Well if you didn't already notice, every single day wether the weather is nice or stormy, there's always this layering dark gray haze in the sky of pollution combined with the sound and congestion of cars going to tons of different destinations. That right there would be a car polluted city, which has a smog problem because of the over use of auto mobiles which is extremely harmful to the environment and us as human beings. You're probably thinking ""How do I stop using my car?"" but the goal isn't to stop using auto mobiles, but maybe to....reduce it.

One very big impact you can make is to ""car pool"" which you probably already do but maybe try if you try making it an every morning habit, like for example: You and your aquaintances go to the same destination for work, and you happen to live within a couple miles of them, if you have time you could pick them up and drop them off which would not only be much better for the environment, you would also be de-congesting traffic by keeping three or more cars off the road. Now imagine if everyone did it? The roads would be calm and empty, making transportation much faster or easier and create huge positive impact on the environment by reducing all those green house gases.

Is the job or place you're heading too, four or less miles away, and you can't pay for that ridiculously priced gallon or two of gas every morning to start your car and you don't have any friends near by to ""car pool""? The answer is simple and actually might get you there faster plus save you lots of money, it's biking there. Now you probably are thinking ""That's completely undesirable to have to do that every day to go somewhere local"". Here is why it's actually a huge advantage over driving that short distance, 1. You'll end up with more money at the end of the week by not buying gas, 2. You will get fit much faster because biking will burn calories just like running or working out would and 3. You can completely avoid congestion which definitely makes your life less stressful because trust me, no one wants to be late for something so close to them just because of car traffic.

To conclude this, it's really ultimately your decison and if you would like to make a extraordinary positive impact on the environment, make your life easier or less stressful, then I'd do it, and maybe along the way you might become better friends with people you know by car pooling with them or become more fit and healthy by making biking just as routine as your car used to be every day for those short distance trips.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

By reducing the usage of cars, you allow for your community to flourish in other ways than building or repairing roads. Since there would be less people driving cars, the community can focus on other things. For example, in Bogota, Columbia, because of the Day Without Cars, there have been 118 miles of bicycle paths that have been constructed. Also, ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city."" Old sidewalks are being replaced with new ones, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have also opened up. All of these great things are happening to the community of Bogota, Columbia, just because they have limited their usage of cars (source 3).

Also, limiting the use of cars would reduce pollution. In places like Paris, France, diesel has been blamed for Paris' days of nar-record pollution. Paris has more smog than most other European capitals, because they have more people driving cars (source 2). ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the US"" (source 1).

Finally, decreasing the usage of cars would create better lifestyles for people. People would be healthier and happier, because instead of driving around everywhere, they get some fresh air and more exercise. Heidrun Walter said that ""when [he] had a car [he] was always tense. [He is] much happier [not driving his car]"" (source 1). Also, don't you hate it when you're stuck in the rush-hour? In Bogota, Colombia, rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic (source 3).

The ""Car-Free cities"" started in the suburbs of Germany. Almost everyone completely gave up their cars. P2 L1-2 states that stret parking and drivewats and home garages are generally forbidden. If you are not completely car-free you pay $40,000 to buy space to park you car(s) along with a home.

Statistics say that 70 percent of families d not own cars anymore, and 57 percent actually sold their cars to move to Germany. Heidrun Wlter stated ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"".

In Paris, due to near-record pollution, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

On certain days motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. the other days same rules apply to odd-numbered license plate owners.

The more cities that start doing a ban on driving cars' or use more enviroment healthy cars are helping reduce pollution and other toxins in the air. p43 states that the Ford company is already making changes to their cars/trucks to make them more enviromentally safe.

The rate of Kids and aduts between the ages of 16-39 getting their licenes and permits have dropped drastically within the past few years. With communication the computers and telephones, teens and alduts feel connected by talking on these devices and don't feel the need as much to drive to go see a friend and find it easier to stay intouch.

In Bogota, Colombia millians of people hike, bike, skate or took buses to work durin a car-free day. It was the third year that cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Wihout Cars in the city. The turnout was large, despite the occasional rain they ecieved, that didnt stop the colombians for doing what they did.  ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza. Two other Colobian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the Day Without Cars event. The citites are generation a revolutionary change in the world.

Well, people say that cars has been very useful to us all, but in reallity it has been harmful to not only us but the earth aswell. In many countries they are banning the usege of the cars because of so much pollution. Studies show that in Europe ""passenger cars are responsable for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions"" and to make matters worse, it is ""up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" This shows how much cars have been harming the earth by increasing the greenhouse gases.

On the other hand, some people have been getting rid of their cars because their country charges them fees for having a car and for parking aswell. Other places where pollution is at the top like Paris, have banned car usage on certain days for people and if they fail to not us their cars they will have to pay a fine. All of this, causes tension and stress as a matter of fact, a woman once said ""when I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way."" Limiting or not using at all your car can free you from tension and stress, also reducing pollution which will help your health.

Furthermore, studies show that in the United States people are buying less cars than before and less people are retaining their drivers license. This is something good because one of ""President Obama's goals is to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions."" This shows how many people are trying very hard to reduce car usage which will reduce pollution. Even young people who are considered rebels of the streets are taking this into consideration because studies ""found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.."" People are aware of the changes that are going on like what a professor said ""different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long term cultural shift."" Reducing or limiting car usage or not using cars at all will not only help you, it will help your neighbors, your family, and most important the earth, where we live in.

The thing these countries have decided to change in their everyday life is to take cars away or start limiting the use of them. Now this might sound like a big deal but their are many advantages to this appeal of motor use.

Some advantages of cars being limited or just not used at all, would mean we would be saving more money. Just think about all the money you throw away to put it towards your car. Their are bills, repairs, new car if you get into a bad acident, ect. The list just goes on and on. Their could be so much more you could spend your money on and it could make are economy richer.

In source 3: car-free day is sprinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky it states that "" In Bogota people who violated the car usage would be faced witha fine of $25"". This is another way of showing you how much money you are wasting on your car.

Another advantage to not owning or using a car would be the pollution levels in the earths atmosphere would go down. In sourse 2:paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer it states that ""after days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a parital driving ban to clean the air of the global city"".

Their are many advantages to not using or at least limiting the use of a car. such as reducing the money that is spent on one which wouls help the economy out. Also reducing the the polluction that cars produce.

(Source 1) Limiting the use of private transportation will bring about cleaner skies, greatly reduce the amount and effects of acid rain, and impede upon the progression of the destruction of our ozone layer in the atmosphere that helps to protect us from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation. If more and more people in not only developed but also developing countries choose to become car- and truck-free, ""where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities,"" (Source 1) our Earth will become a much cleaner and healthier place for young and old alike.

There have been many previous efforts to make cities denser and more walking- and biking-friendly, but most of these advances have been limited by or even been put to a stop because of the need for an excessive amount of large roads and space for parking for the huge amount of private passenger cars found in cities and suburbs today. Reducing the amount of cars on the road can free up space for more important things such as housing, shops, financial districts, and even parks or other recreational areas that can be more inviting to citizens rather than the loud hustle and bustle of high-density roadways. ""'All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,' said David Goldberg, and official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars."" (Source 1) Removing the problem of private transportation from city planning and development can greatly increase the quality and efficiency of our city's layouts.

Many people consider New York City to be the ""city that never sleeps,"" because of the loud and constant noise of outside motors revving and angry drivers honking their car horns. New York City, along with many other large cities, face this problem which has been growing since the late 1940's. With the rise of reduced dependency on private means of transportation, places such as the more populated areas of New York may finally be able to take a nap. ""BOGOTA, Colombia- . . . millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" (Source 3) Noise isn't the only quality of life improvement that citizens of large cities can experience with a drop of the amount of cars on streets and boulevards. Levels of smog, a mixture of smoke a fog caused by excessive amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the air, would also start to fall down to a point where they would barely be noticable. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city . . . Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . The fog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" (Source 2)

Limiting car use can be extremely beneficial if executed correctly. These benefits include a cleaner city, more efficient uses of space, and an increase in the desirability of larger cities and towns. Overall, a reduction to the amount of private vehicles on the road would be a great improvement for a multitude or reasons.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
6CE22C58A24E,"The invention of the car was a revolution in itself, developing a new, faster way to get to far away places. However, the more people use transportation the more it seems to affect our everyday lives in both positive and negative ways. Transportation can cause a lot of pollution which could in later years really affect how people live their lives today, but a new car-free revolution could be just what the world needs to delay that probable outcome.

Pollution comes from all different kinds of things like cars, factories, and even smoking. Right now this is the only world in which is sutible for people to live on and all these things that pollute the air could risk how much longer people get to have it. Andrew Selsky says that in Bogota, Columbia the 7 million citizens have dedicated a day in which no personal car transportation is used. This one day has not only helped reduce the pollution, but also benefit the town in many different ways. Such as new parks and stores have been able to open, sidewalks have been re-paved, rush-hour restictions cutting the traffic down, and also the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. This ""Car-Free Day"" has also reached out into other countries as well and according to Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.""

A businessman named Carlos Arturo Plaza says that the ""Car-Free Day"" in Bogota is, ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Just one day without having to drive and worry about the risks of driving can take a weight of stress off of some peoples' shoulders. In Vauban, Germany there are no residents that own a single car. Elisabeth Rosenthal described the city saying that, ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district..."" Some of the towns residents said that having a car would always have them tense and they were much happier living in a ""no car city"". Having to deal with every day stress is hard enough, but when you have to deal with additional driving stress it can really take a toll on some people.

""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fower cars, driving less and getting fower licenses as each year goes by,"" says Rosenthal. America has long been known as one of the world's prime car cultured countries in the world, but since the peak of miles driven in 2005 these miles have been steadily decrreasing with every year. Studies have shown that there has been a big drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds who get their license. The percentage of young drivers getting their licenses has decreased by 23% between the years 2001 and 2009 in America alone. A decrease in people owning their own vehicles means that there could be a decrease in the pollution that cars burden the earth with every year.

Bogota, Colombia is a great example of a new revolution soon to come. This hopeful revolution will not only decrease pollution, but stress as well. A decrease in the popullation of young people getting their licenses could also greatly affect the way in which the world transports people from place to place. Transportation can cause a lot of pollution which could in later years really affect how people live their lives today, but a new car-free revolution could be just what the world needs to delay that probable outcome.

253F3DB00C5A,"Limiting car usage in our daily life can be a good thing. There has been cities and countries that have already started going ""Car-free"" acording to articles one, two and, three. Limiting car usage in our daily life can reduce Greenhouse gas. Reducimg the time ou use to drive your car or automobile it reduces on how much money you are wasting on gasoline or diesel.

Limiting car usage is a good thing, in article two it talks about Paris banning driving due to high levels of smog. Paris had enforced a short driving ban to clear the air out of the city. If you were to drive in that time period you would have suffered a $31 dollar fine. Diesel fuel was to blame since France favors diesel more than gasoline due to a tax policy. Up to 67 percent of vehicles in France are made up of diesel. In Germany a city called Vaunban has given up the life of cars mostly. Vaunban's treets are mostly ""car Free"" except along the main throughfare according to article one. One of the reasons the city of Vaunban has given up on the life of cars is their are only two place to park, large garages at the edge of the development for $40,000 along with a home. For that 70 percent os families in Vaunban do not own cars. Heidrun walter, a media tranier in Vaunban, said "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" In Europe pasenger cars have been responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas while in the United States it is up to 50 percent in some areas according to article one.

Another Country that has been trying to reduce the amount of car usage is Colombia. In Bogota, Colombia they are doing a program that they are trying to spread to other countries. They have held a day each year for a ""car free"" da. For three years cars have been banned for the Day without cars. The only cars that are pemitted are taxis and buses on that day. Since that Bogota has inspired other cities in Colombia to go with a ""Car free"" day. Cali and Valledupar have joined the event. Parks and sports centers have bursting throughtout Bogota according to Article two. The sidewalks that have been uneven and cracked have been replace by new, smooth sidewalks. Another good thing is the restrictions have quickly cut traffic. Also new restaurants and shopping centers have rose up. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said ""These people are generating a revoultionary change, and this is crossing borders.

America has also joined on to limiting car usage. President Barack Obama has goals to reduce the greenhouse gas emmisions accordiing to source four. In paragraph 38 according to Dr. Sivak's research it says that there has been a huge drop in the amount of 16 to 39 year olds getting drivers licenses. Another study has found that in 2012 driving by young people have declined 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. A good thing for limiting car usage has lead to a executive chaiman of the ford company, Bill Ford, has put out a business plan that has them partnernign up with a telecommunications industry. By doing this he says ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""

Limiting car usage in our daily life is a good thing. It reduces greenhous gas emmisions, lead to restaurants and shopping centers to rise up, better sidewalks, less traffic, and improved safety. Alot of countries and cities have eithered stopping using cars mostly or has reduced car usage by having one day a year without cars.                                                                              ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

However, the advantages of limiting car usage are great. General stress decreases, and polution to the environment also decreases. People are not only helping themselves, but also helping the ecosystem.

Stress. Everyone has it; but what if it could be decreased just by using personal transportation less? In Germany, there are certain communities that ban car usage. No cars are allowed inside the city. Street parking, driveways, and home garages have become obsolete. One citizen of one of the towns said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (

In German Suburbs

). The anxiety one gets when driving a car is almost unreal. Most kids 16 and up now just do not get their licenses just because the thought of driving scares them. Citizens of cities that have just one day where cares are prohibited, such as Bogota, Colombia, love that singular day out of the year. Most say its a good opportunity to increase mental health (

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota)

. Stress not only is awful for mental health, but also physical. 75% of those who have high levels of anxiety, or are exposed to it, are tired all the time, often feel weak, or sometimes may even cause heart issues. The number one reason people have stress is by driving. So using cars less is the best way to decrease stress, and promote good mental health.

Most people that read or watch the news know that the environment is hurt, and that the human population is at fault. How? Excess usage of motor vehicles. As stated in

In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. These statistics are horrible. Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of near-recorcd pollution rates (

Paris bans driving due to smog

) Not only was nature being hurt, but the population of France. Breathing in smog is unnatural. Thehuman body can not take that many polutants, and so it tries to fix itself. In doing this, lung cancer rates rise, pnumonia rates rise, diseases in general become more abundant. Paris took action. When enforcing the driving ban, congestion was down 60% in just five days. The only partial solution to this rising amount of smog is to decrease driving rates, and to use deisel gas less. I hate this test so much why am I even writing this I feel like a robot just going through the motions and its your fault. I blame you.

Rome was not built in a day, so getting state legislatiors or even government officials to agree on a partial driving rule may take a while. However, citizens can spread the word of the evils of driving. You, dear reader, can fix this problem. Try carpooling to work, riding your bike to places near you instead of driving. Do what you can to reduce polution and stress. Influence your friends and family to do the same. Together, we can rase awareness of the evils of driving. Together, we can rule the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

If we as human beings keep relying on cars as much as we do the world will be in bad shape

US as people have to treat the earth better because this is our home ,this is were we have to live and many generations after us have live .

The number of miles driven per person in america has definetly decreased over the years, the recession had a lot to do with that. With that being saidmany measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is underway. The rates of car ownership in america has also decresed. Maybe that means something more fundamental is going on.

By us using cars as much as we do pullution starts to happen. One of the biggest pollutes cars cause is smog.

smog is like fog but it contains gases and if we keep relying on cars as much as we do the world wont be a safe place for us to live. Smog got so bad in france that they had to stop people from drivng.

0FAAEE0E7C29,"There are alot of good advantages on limiting car usage and the limit on cars usage should be something enforced more often worldwide .Cars are helpful and very useful when it comes to transportation but cars can also be harmful to the earth. Cars are contributing to the pollution of the air and is one of the big reasons why the number of cars used in communities should be reduced.

There are many advantages on limiting car usage for examle if we start limiting the usage of cars there will be less worries about smog. According to the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"",""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after five-days of intensifying smog...diesel was blamed ,diesel makes up sixty-seven percent of vehicles in france"". This evidence proves that cars are harmful to the air and will eventually become a problem for the people. Bogota, Colombia has a program where people hiked, skated, biked, or took buses to get to and from work. According to the article car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota the goal of this program is to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"".

Most people would probably say that there should be no limit on car usage because people are very dependent on cars for their transportation but are not aware of the pollution and dagers that cars bring to the community. according to the article ""recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as each year goes by"". Our president Barrack Obama has a goal to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions.

Its not hard to see that the advantages we have on limiting car usage are abundant, and we all should help to contribute to the reduction of cars used everyday.

BE70137207BC,"Limiting car usage is a tremendous advantange. Haven't you ever thought why? limiting car usage has its reason why its an advantage. One of the huge reasons is pollution, cars tend to create pollution, congestion, smog and many other harmful things. Source 1-4 mentions useful information of the disadvantage of owning or driving a car. Source number two mentions how cars tends to create alot of pollution, for this reason in Paris they decided to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Nobody would like to live in a place where you have to be breathing dirty, contaminated air and knowing you produced it by your own car when Paris enforced to ban cars for a few days to clear out the global air not many fellow citizens participated about 4,000 citizen were charged with a fine for not following the rule. why would you try to be disobbident when what they are trying to do is help you clear out the global sir so the citizens living in that area dont get sick with any disease and dont harm our earth where we live. The advantage of limiting car usage will be creating less pollution to have a better global air. Cars aren't the only way to get to place to place there is other way to transport for example public tranport like buses, train or even if its not that far walking and itll be a create exercise.

Yes, driving a car could sound great because you get to drive anywhere you want and get to places quicker instead of catching or waiting for a public transport when you need to get somewhere and your in a rush. Cars are a huge hand like a big help because it helps people get from place to place. Also remember that cars arent cheap at all an example is that source number one mentions "" Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two placesto park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" What this quote is pointing out is that to be able to park a car if you own one it has to be in a specific place and which you have to own and live by there which costs alot of money. Limiting yourself for car usage would make you save up a whole lot of money. Instead of wasting like 40,000 dollars in a parking place for a car and have to be living there you can easily just get on public transport and be able to live where you want. source #1 also mentions "" As a result 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a to move here. when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" this also points out the not many people in Germany dont own cars and not owning a car really doesnt bother them because they found better way to get a transport and also believing that Saving up money is a really important thing because when you become independ you have to start paying bills, food, and many other things that wyour parents wont give you anymore so why waste it on gas and car washing instead of just getting somewhere in a easy transport and the money you wouldve been wasting in non-sense now will be saved up for something more useful. thinking about it car limiting is a useful thing finacialy and global reaosns too.

Lastly another advantage of limiting car usage is less congestion the less driving there is the less traffic there will be. Traffic is a big headche to people who try to get to their jobs or certain events on time. Public transportion might ttake long to get there also but its becauise there isnt as much buses because not many people get on public transportion and the less buses there is and more cars who cause traffic the more time it'll take off our time. Source #3 states "" in a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colobians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams."" Bogota, colombia has a great point doing this event once a year will demonstrate citizen that the less car usage the less traffic jams there with be and it will be more relaxing and calming area to live instead of hearing screaming, beeping and other annoying sounds caused by unpatient people. This event that colombia has done has cause other states to realize that thats a great idea and some tried experminting it in their country.

In conclusion limiting car usage has its great advantages which benefits the citizens living in that area so if it benefits you why not try limiting car usage. Limiting car usage creates less pollution, less traffic jams, and your able to save up your money for something thats actually important. Cars aren't the only way you could get from place to place theres many other options like walking, or riding a public transport theres always an answer to everything. By limiting car usage we create less pollution in the air we breathe and there wil be less harm done to the earth and to the citizens. Always try new things and let limmiting car usage be one of them.    ",6,Car-free cities,Text dependent

By limiting the amount that the citizens of the United States operate their vehicles, the condition of our environment's atmosphere will improve.  As stated in Source 1, ""and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""  This passage is referring to the amount of greenhouse gas emitted here in America because of passenger cars.  By not using car and taking advantage of other methods of transportation such as buses, walking, and riding a bike that number can be reduced significantly.  In the United States we are also learning from mistakes made by other countries and cities.  ""After days of near-record pollution,"" Source 2 says, ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""  A lesson can be taken from Paris of how we do not want to end up in a situation like that.  By limiting our driving currently we can avoid having to take major steps to clean and clear our environment.  ""It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants,"" a sociologist predicts in Source 4.  Environmental advantages of reducing greenhouse gas is a major way we can benifit from limiting car usage.

A decent amount of stress comes with owning and operating a motorized vehicle.  You are constantly worrying about if you will be late, or if you have enough gas to make it from point A to point B.  Children are another concern and trying to keep them safe around roads and driving by themselves.  Limiting the use of cars can create a less stressful, and safer society.  In Source 3 it explains that, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""  Lowering the use of cars can make life a little less busy because it is one thing less that you have to worry about throughout your day.  Heidrun Walter said, in Source 1, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""  Reducing the usage of cars can promote a less stressful and safer lifestyle here in the United States.

Although the use of cars may be convienent, the benifits of limiting the usage may be beginning to outweight the inconviences.

But recently we have been cutting back on the usage of cars and we could extend the life of our planet by simply not driving.

Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisions and it caused Paris to ban driving for a little while due to smog, environmental conditions worsen by the day and it is apparent. Yet we still drive our fancy cars around like there isn't a problem. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the U.S."" states Elisabeth Rosethal from the article ""In German Suburb Life goes on without cars."" That is a lot of pollution entering our atmosphere.

Americans and other citizens around the world have increasingly recognized this problem and started taking the initiative to change it. In Bogota, Colombia one day out of the year all cars are banned except taxi's and busses. ""Violaters faced 25 dollar fines... but the turnout was large, despite the gray clouds that dumped rain showers"" Andrew Skelsky says from the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.""

7572D2FA0521,"There are some advantages without having cars to drive as seen in a suburb in German. This car free suburb has band the use of cars it is illegal to drive a car if you live in the suburb. it is a car free place although if you by a car you have to buy a special spot in a garage and spend upwards up to 40,000 dollars for a spot. People actually move to this suburb for the relief of driving a car because of the stress that goes into everyday driving. This suburb is living ""smart"" they have developed a new way to live this suburb is fitted with stores so you can still get all your groceries, clouths, etc. Living here it would be easiest to puchase a bicycle in order to get around in a faster way outher then walking. Here in this suburb over 70 percent of Vaubans families dont not own cars and 57 percent sold a to move here.

The car freesubhurb has slowly grown and its still growing everyday IN Vauban there are over 5,500 residents who live there within a rectangular square mile. STores are placed a walk away on a mainstreet rather down a road on a highway. Although the area in small enough to walk through the advanteges for shopping is great your not far from home and you can still take a bicycle to get around. The exhuast level in the air has decreased dramaticly in this suburb more and more places want to start this new way of living but outher people may not like living so close to eachouther some people like there privacy out and away from outhers.

Paris has band driving due to all the smog produced by all the cars. In paris driving you will be fined almost 4,000 people were fined for driving there cars. If paris resorts to the ""smart"" way of living as in Vauban German the smog levels would decrease raoidly if they banned cars.  Ome cities are even trying to band public transportation because of all the the smog. Thats a valad point if you were to band cars youd have to ban outher transportations like buses, cabs, etc. If the new style of living hits the united states my choice of transportation will be a horse just like the old days.

FE018F15F8A4,"Cars use a lot of gas and make the world polluted. There are communities that have given up their cars and are sticking to walking and riding bikes. There is a town in Germany called Vauban that make you pay $40,000 with your house if you want to have a parking space. Also in this town there are only two places to park and this means that 70% of the population there down own cars and 57% sold their cars to live there. People in this town say that living there with no cars relieves stress.

In the city of Paris after days of pollution they made a ban on driving to fix the smog.

On mondays motorist that had even number license plates were told not to drive or face a $31 dollar fine. On the next day odd number license plate couldnt drive. 4,000 people were fined and 27 had their cars impounded do to their reaction to the fine. Their were a couple exceptions like plug-in cars, hybrids, also cars carrying more then three people but they make plubic transit free from Monday to Friday.

These acts are happening in countries like Colombia. In Bogota, Colombia they celebrate their third year where cars have been banned with the onmly motor transportation being buses and taxis. They call this day ""The day without cars"" in the capital city which has about 7million poeple. They are doing this to pormote other mean of transportation and violators adn fined $25. A lot of people like to participate in this because it lowers air pollution and stress. Because of this day this city has made 118 miles of bike paths.

In America scientist have found that people 16- to -39 years old are not etting their license. With this drop scientist think that pollution will go down in America. In 2005 the number of miles was at its peak and dropped steadily after that. In April of 2013 the number of miles driven per person was 9% below the peak and is even with the the amount in 1995.

D6F39AE89719,"Ever wonder how the world would be without cars?  Some advantages would be, cutdown on smog, less traffic jams, and much less car incipients. The world would positively be changed. Paris has already taken action to fight against the crisis of these negative effects on the city.

Parking is one problem about going somewhere like the beach and you cant be close to the beach because someone is already there. VAUBAN, Germany-Residents of his upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms oc commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars, according to Elisabeth Rosenthal, source 1, paragraph 1. Therefore, car accidents may happen at a higher chance, due to the overload of cars on the road. Cars are best used for far traveling and can go much faster and carry more of a load when going on a 200 mile trip, I would not want to have a bike.

According to source 2, Robert Duffer, claims in paragraph 1, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. They put a 22-euro or $31 fine on anyone that did not leave their cars at home, according to paragraph 2. During that fine, 4,000 drivers were fined. Reducing car use can make the air or sky clear without smog, Diesel fuel was to blame. Paris has typically more smog than other European capitals, because Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in france.

Remember those time comsuming traffic jams that cause you to be late for just about anyhting? Moreover, limiting car usage can stop all those incidents and can clear up all of the roadways. Bikes, trams, city buses, can change the world of pollution. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in-cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers, according to source 2. The bikes through the city can be more friendly and also give opportunity for getting to know your neighbors in your neighborhood.

Reducing the car use will definetly benefit lots of people. What do you think the world would be like without cars? Would the deletion of cars set us apart from shipping? The people that enjoy traveling, they would have to switch to a hybrid or gas friendly car in order to save the environment and money.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F468E21A6DEE,"Normally in everyone's mind when they are a teenager they want to have a car to go to places such as the mall, beach, etc. There are advantages though to limiting car usage. The whole planet should really hear or read about it, it's amazing to what these advantages can do for you, others, and our ecosystem.

The first of many reasons why we should limit car usage is because of greenhouse gas emissions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of gas emissions in Europe. . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States(Source 1)."" This just shows the evidence by the future if this keeps going like this the Whole entire planet would be all polluted which would make living conditions harder than they have to be. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way(Source 1)."" Looking at this quote tells me that she must have been stressed with the car, maybe it was because of the traffic or the gas bill who knows, but she does feel happier without it so she must feel more at ease that her area is not cramped up with cars. In Vauban, Germany if you own a car where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner must buy a space, for $40,00, along with a home. Well sign me up with a bike or running shoes because I don't have that kind of money to spend just to live in a area with no cars.

Furthermore I would like to go to Paris, but sources state that ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals(Source 2)."" Reuters had found 147 micrograms of particulate matter or PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. That is pretty bad and knowing that people say that you must go to Paris, yeah sure for I can get polluted air into my system got it. ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since Frtance has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" According to Reuters ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe(Source 2)."" Even Bogata, Columbia has a ""Car-free day"" and if you don't follow the rules of car-free day you will be fined $25. Carlos Arturo Plaza stated ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" as he and his wife rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife(Source 3).

It is just clear that most areas in the world are trying to change the way we live our lives for the sake of all human life. It is a good oppurtunity to relieve stress and lower air pollution as the source stated before.

E6E39EFC638C,"As human beings we must care for the earth that was so kindly bestowed upon us, meaning we must do all in our power to prevent it from self-destructing due to our carlessness. One way we seem to have recently discoved we can make a difference is that the limiting of car usage is an enormous step towards our goal. Cars have been a topic of contriversy worldwide, as it seems people refused to stop the usage of such a helpful tool in todays society, but as time goes on we have opened our eyes to a world of better choices. Citizens from all around see that car usage can be cut down, and it will be an astonishing change for both humans, as well as the earth. The limitation of car usage will provide a more healthy enviornment for the earth as well as those who live on it. Cars are a simply a machine in which we have allowed ourselves to believe that life can not go on without it. Here we will discover how truley wrong we were.

Although we all understand that these vehicles allow use to save much time by getting us to our destinations quicker, it does alot of harm to our planet as well. As stated in the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", cars are responsible for 50 percent greenhouse gas emission in certain areas of the United states. The fuel we use to power our cars is released into the O-Zone layer, and into our atmosphere which creates a greenhouse affect and slowly, but surley destroys our enviornment. However, we have the power to protect the planet we live on for we have so many different choices of transpertation that causes way less harm. Cutting down on driving is a simple task in which we can all participate in.

Next we focus more on how car limiation affects ourselves. Driving take a toll on us because other forms of transportation do so much good towards ones self being, but as humans we seem to always take the easy way out. If we didnt always use cars, and took a walk for instance it would improve health as well as many other things. In an artice written by Andrew Selsky it states that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The less smog in the air, the better we can breath which will improve our health, and walking is good for that as well. We don""t need cars to live our lives. Life goes on without the use of a machine.

All in all cars we must care for this world as well as ourselves, and this is the first step towards this goal. Some fear that this change in society will have horrible consequences because we are so use to cars in our life, but these vehicles dont control us. By use limiting car usage we are providing a healthier enviornment for both human beings as well as our earth. Lets take the steps toward making this world a better place to live for us as well as the many generations to come. Don't you wish to live in a clean, and healthy world?

49B96587BE63,"Recent trends are showing that the average person is trading in their keys for a more contemporary mode of transportation, such as public transit or walking and biking from point A to point B. Even though the reason as to why this is occuring has yet to become clear, there are some general benefits that are known to come from this. More and more, cities in developed and developing nations are now being planned to be more dense, so that the citizens in them can get to where they need to be, without needing a car. Because of this, fewer greenhouse emissions are being created, there is less congestion and smog in cities, and the burden of traffic is being lifted from the everyday driver. The more this trend continues, the more beneficial it can become.

Climate change is a ubiquitous threat to the world. In order to face and reverse the direction of where the world is heading, some cities are finding new ways to face this issue. For example, a city in Germany has practically given up cars through its policies and design. Citizens are only allowed two places to park, and the city is designed so that everything you need is within a walking or biking distance, albeit more dense. More and more places are slowly beginning to adopt this style of suburb because ""emissions from an increasing middle class are choking cities"" (source 1). Making this change will not be easy, but it is important because ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent [...] in the United States"" (source 1).

Another issue that weighs down cities everywhere is the horrid smog and unbearable congestion most cities face. In order to combat this adverse effect of driving, Paris has banned driving in efforts to reduce the smog it deals with. The effort proved to create a temporary solution, as ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog"" (source 2). A city in Bogota, Columbia has taken a day off from driving, and the results were so positive that the movement has spread to multiple cities in neighboring countries. This movement ""[left] the street eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (source 3).

In an ever changing world that exists today with cities that never sleep, the average person is constantly burdened and stressed by things that tend to pile up. So why have driving and traffic be added to that heap of annoyance, especially if it's avoidable? The fact is, driving can be incredibly stressful and sometimes border on superfluous. A resident of the densely populated german town where 70 percent of its citizens don't own cars claimed, ""when I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"", referring to how they no longer need to own a car or drive (source 1). The day of no driving in Bogota, Columbia has been said to be""a good oppurtunity to take away stress"" (source 3).

Modern nations have revolved heavily on the invention and continuous innovation of the automobile. However, the increasing dependence on this mode of transportation has created some adverse affects for the general population of the world. In order to solve this problem, an emphasis on cleaner and more efficient modes of transportation must occur, along with more densely designed, modern cities. A larger independence from cars can create fewer greenhouse emissions, cause less congestion and smog in cities, and make the average citizen free from the stress of driving. Change will only ensue with a more proactive stance on this issue    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

A small experimental suburb in Germany is tooling with the idea of a no car life style, along with many cities in the United States where a car is not a neccesity. Paris however has banned car usage all together, becuase of the amount of smog produced becuase of the automobiles. This could marke the end of car culture across many countries, exspecially the United States. There are many advantages to not owning or using a car, some of them may just cause you to get ride of your car.

A small suburb in Germany on the France and Swiss border have given up on their cars. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in the experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg."" The streets of this small town are car free. The twon offers a tram that runs through the downtown, and a few small streets on one edge of the community. The town cannot bain cars altogether, but if you own a car the only place to store it is in large garages at the edge of the town. One space can cost $40,000, the cost of the space comes with the home. Only 70 percent of the population in Freiburg owns a car and 57 percent sold there vehicle before moving. Germany isn't the only country with this type of movement. The United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. This will cause increase demand of public transport to the suburbs surrounding big cities such as Chicago and New York.

Paris, however, is the first city to prohibit driving altogether. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drribing ban to clear the air of the global city. Drivers where asked to leave their cars at home or risk a fine of 22 -euro ($31). Almost 4,000 drivers where fined. Diesel fuel was blamed becuase France has a tax policy which promotes diesel fuel. Almost 70% of drives have diesel vehicles. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, but exceptions where made for hybrids and electric vehicles. The public transit was free of charge during the bane.

""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emission, unveiled last week.""

People are driving about as much as they did in 1995 which is 9% lower then the peak in 2005. Some people may blame the lack of cars and driving on the reccession. On the other hand people were buying less cars two to three years befor the reccession even hit. If this pattern presists sociologist believe it will be eneficial for cabon emissions and the enviorment. This is becuase transpertation is the 2nd leading cause of carbon emission. This could have negitive effects on the automotive companies but they are already rebranding themselves as mobiltiy companies. This allows them to have a broder range of personal vehicles. Cities like New York have established a bike sharing program. This allows people access to bikes accross the city instead of taking a taxi. Many of the young people accross the country have not even bothered to get driver's liscenses. Driving decreased by 23% between years 2001 and 2009. They instead plan activites where they can walk or ride a bike.

The age of the car may be coming to an end. Communities have started promoting a car free life style. Made othe ways of transportation avaliable.

Many people are glad that they had sold thier car because it just cost to much money for others. Therefore many people need to limit their car usage.

To begin with, Cars could have many flaws that may infect the environment or humans. Stated in source 2 ""After dats of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" So because cars take in gas it may effect the environment because inside of the car is more chemicals a that comes out of the exhust system. Stated in Soure 1 ""Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be apporved this year, Mr. Goldberg said."" this may be true because gas prices may go down and the environment will stay clean. However, waiting for public may mean waiting for a couple of hours. But when having a car a person can get to their event or job on time. Stated in Source 3 ""The day without cars is part of an improvent campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s."" Maybe if the United States started to start a campaign then maybe their wouldn't be so much smog in the air thats pulluting the environment.

Also, in America many people would never give up their cars just for the looks. Stated in Source 4 ""But America's love affair withits vehicles seems to be cooling.""

Although, stated in Source 4"" Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question."" In my opinion i wouldn't take a bunch of kids on the train just to get to school or to a  soccer game and then once that is all over with then have to get back on the train just to take tem back home. Anything can happen. That's why having cars have pro's and Con's. But others may think of the train ride as bonding time or just getting to know the full team better.

Stated in Source 3 ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city;uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.""

Making the normal car nicer and more high tech.

Did you know that the adverage person will spend up to two years of their lives sitting in traffic? Thats a long time! Thats 730 days we could be spending doing something completly different, and probably something more important and productive. New trends that say the whole town should'nt use cars are genious! we wouldn't waste so much money on Gas, and let alone the thousands of dollars we put into buying or leasing a car. Some peoples concerns might be that this new and up coming trend might put many people out of work. But it will save so many lives.

And how about all you tree huggers out there, think of how much cleaner the world would be.

Rechargeablecars are great, but they still do damage to the enviornment. We woudn't have to worry about global warming as mcuh, or all the pollution in the air. This will save so many lives and not just human lives, I'm talking about trees, plants, animals. Everthing will be saved. Less polution in the air can fix many problems.

As for the obeicity problem all around the world, that will be helped as well. With no cars people will have to excersise to get where they need to go. When we need to go to the market we would have to walk, run, or ride a bicycle. This would be the push we need to end obeicity. People will get fit and not even know it. Kids would walk or bike to school, meaning there would have to be more schools because they would have to be closer. We could be putting the money we put into for cars, for school! This is how Obamas 2 free yars of college could be paid for. Making the people of America more educated.

The better educated we are the better jobs we will get. Making the profits we made from gas unnessicary. We could now have more doctors, teachers, and so on and so forth. Automobeal Machanics are great, my dad is one, but without cars they could use their smart engineering talents for something else. Something else like making airplanes, or making our military more equipt for battles. We could have all these updated things, and be saving money towards other things thay could be really befitting us.

I'm not trying to say that cars aren't totally awesome, cause I'm all for a good old classic car. But without cars, our country, economy, our people, will be healthier. This is something we should really look into. It could pay for schooling, save money, drematiclly help the obeicity problem. There are so many things that will benifit us from this.            ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
176EEB8310AC,"The limiting of persoanlcar usage has done wonders for the areas that this policy has be implmented. Strictly enviermentaly swpeaking in the cites that have limited their residents persoal car usage the smog rates went drasicly down. Thoughschanges happened in a matter of days. Imagin the changes that could accoure if limited car usage was implmented on a wider scale for the long term. Not only envirermentaly benifical but limited car usage also has large and far reaching econmic and social upsides. The lack of money being waisted on persoanl automobeal transportation leads to a surplus of savings for everyday familes to spend or more nessary items. Socialy limited car usage has be proven to be benifal as a whole also. People living in areas that have  already been placed under this polices report signifigent reducions in stress and worrying, leading to much weight off their sholders and a genaeral better aqttude over all.

The first and most obveous advantage of the limed car usage policiy is the masive positive impact the police has the earth. As stated in source one and I quote ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."". Now imagin if thoes percentages just went away. In the city of Vauban Germany, an expermental city already under the policy, it did. Another example if Paris. A city that literly had to force the policy of limited car usage apon it people in a desperate attempt to reverse what the evils of personal car usgae was doing to the atmosphere of the city. The personal cars created smog so think the city hit record polution levels that even rivaled Beijing its self, one of the worlds most poluted citys. As stated in source two, the city put a ban on cars with any license plates that were even numbered on the first day from driving and a ban on odd numbered the second day. The positives of the limited car usage plicy was so instantanous that the second day of no driving for odd numbered cars ws deamed not nessary. The massive envirmental advantages of the limited car usage policiy can neiter be denyed or ignored.

The economic advantages of this policy can also not be ignored. To fully grasp the economic upswing that will accure under this policy we must turn our attention the the great city of Bogota, Colombia. In this former Spanish colony turned capital city a program has been set up called the ""car-free day"". On this day no cars are driven and a festable is set up to promote alternate transportaion and reduce smog. This year two other Colombian citys, Cali and Valledupar joned the event citing the obouse advantages of the policy. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" says buisinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza source 3 quotes. The policy as done economic wonders not only for the people but for the city its self. since the day begin in the mid 1990s over 118 miles of bike path have been created, parksand sports centers have bloomed throughout the city, uneven sidke walks have been leveled out, and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up as reported by source 3. The limited car usage policy cound be the merical policy for citys in need of an economic boost.

Finaly the social advantages of the policy have also been noted.

The evils of the modern day car culture must be destroyed. As said by Carlos Plaza preveously ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"". ""When i had a car I was always tense. Im mush happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter resident of Vauban. Two people on two totaly differnt sides of the world both experenced the social advantages of this policy. Even young people are seeing the advantages according to a study last year that found that driving by young people devreased  23 percent between 2001 and 2009 according to source 4.

As one can now clearly see the advantages of limted personal car usage are impossibkle to deny and even harder to ignore. Economicly,socialy, and enviromentaly this policy as done wonders where ever it has been implimented. It has both immeadit and long term positive effects with no odveous negitive effects. Altrnates to personal cars could be things like Bill fords bisiness plan for a world in which personal vehical ownership is replaced witha partnering with the telecommunications industy to create citys in which pedestrians, bicycle, private cars, and public and commerical traffic are woven into a connected netword. The acceptence of limited car usage and the extenciton of modern day car culture is the next step for the advacment of humanity.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
4F7EC90286F8,"There are many advantages to driving a car but there are even more reasons to limiting usage on cars as there are to driving one.

Most people today drive thier cars to get from one location to another, but most do not think about what it actually does to the environment. Most cars run on a form of Diesel fuel which release carbon emissions and other greenhouse gasses which are harmful towards the environment. Passenger cars in Europe are responsible for around 12% of the greenhouse gasses there. And in most car intensive areas in the United States up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions is released. For a day in France car usage was banned to reduce the amount of smog in the area. After 5 days of intensifying smog the amount of car traffic was reduced by 60%. another great reason for reducing the usage of cars is that it causes less stress towards people and yourself. And it greatly reduces traffic for other cars. in Bogota, once a year they have a day without cars which is part of an improvement campaign that began in the mid-1990s. Since then it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bike paths, sports centers, and multiple parks. Some people prefer biking than driving which i salso a good way to get fit. Since there are so many bikers there most of the uneven sidewalks have been replaced by larger and smoother sidewalks.

In the end, there are many reasons to limit the usage of cars but people should consider it more for what it does for the world.                                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
64183B7D3207,"Some cities are making themselves car-free. Like in Vauban, Germany; Paris; Bogota, Colombia; and even the president of the United States is trying to ""curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions"" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 29). In Vauban, Germany residents of a community are ""going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: the have given up their cars"" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 1).Some advantages of limiting car usage is people are happier without cars and it promotes the alternative transportation and reduce smog.

The first advantage of limiting car usage is that people are happier without cars. ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor"" (Selsky, Paragraph 27). ""As a result, 70 pecent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"""" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 3). ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without cars in this capital city of 7 million"" (Selsky, Paragraph 21). ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning""""(Rosenthal, Paragraph 4). Finally ""the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 35).

The second advantage of limiting car usage is that it promotes the alternative transportation and it reduces smog. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Duffer, Paragraph 10). ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known os one of the most polluted cities in the world"" (Duffer, Paragraph 14). ""millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Selsky, Paragraph 20). Also ""the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped speadily thereafter.... As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995"" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 32). And ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession mat find less reason to resum the habit"" (Rosenthal,Paragraph 36). But finally ""Mine (19 and 21) have not botheres to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends"" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 39).

And those are the reasons why some cities are making themselves car-free. People are a lot more happy with no cars as said from Elisabeth Rosenthal """"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". And also because people are trying to promote the alternative transportation and reduce smog, thats why Paris ""enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" (Duffer, Paragraph 10). So what do you think should citites ban driving?    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D1A2D5B3B446,"The wheel was the first step that took society into the making of the mobile car. Today millions of cars are made each year to help humans transport around the cities and streets around the world. Every vehicle that is powered by gasoline emits carbon dioxide, this gas is very harmful for the enviorment, it causes the ozone later to slowly dissolve and it also causes acid rains. Traffic jams is one of the many effects of having too many cars in a certain populated area. Debt has also been an influencial part in the quantity of cars around the globe. Car usage and production should be drasticly reduced to ensure a better future for all living things in the Planet Earth.

Furthermore, Global warming has slowly made its toll on Earth, most of which has been produced by the Carbon Dioxide gases in the atmosphere, this gas is a mayor green house gas. Over the years cars have been more exstensivly used and have a great percentage in world contamination, As stated in article 1 pharagraph 5 ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensove areas in the united states"". This being, if car production and usage are reduced, Earth will have positive reactions to this change. The levels of global warming will also be reduced all around, this will help us conserve our north and south poles for a longer period of time, keeping safe all the animals related to that area like penguinzs and polar bears.

In addition, Traffic jams arent the most pleaseant place to be, due to the fact that they're unpredictable and in most cases highly annoying. Information from passage 2 pharagraph 14 states that ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france"", this was due to oderly assigning days in which certain cars with certain license plates can drive through the cities of france. Less congestion means higher percent in mobility all around, this can greatly effect a 3 hour traffic jam to a simple 20 minute ride. Coming and going from places can be a brease, and this will also facilitate extra time for other potential activities. Reducing car usage and congestion can also lead to less accidents and car crashes.

Moreover, Leasing or buying a new car can come heavy on the pocket. Financial debt has been arounced ever since a currency started, debt is unpredictable sometimes and can happen to any individual. Having the latest model of a car can be a luxury only some can afford, the individuals who try and cant afford it ussually end up in debt, as reinforced in article 4 pharagraph 32 ""Cash- Strapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway"". Ussually some individuals ""bite more than they can chew"" and this can harm not only one indivual, but the economy as a whole. Reducing the mayor debt that can come from car leasing can improve a counrtys economy and benift milliones of individuals.

Concluding, many reasons show society to reduce the usage of cars. One being that gasoline and petrolium powered cars can contaminate the planet Earth, melt our poles, destroy the ozone layer and cause harmful weather effects. Also, the reduction of cars can lead to the de-congestion of cities in which indiviuals can more easily and freely move around adding time for them to use as they like. Lastly, the economy can have a mayor boost if car reduction and usage from leasing can occur. In conclusion, the reduction of car usage and production is a great benefit for every individual who lives on Earth, and can lead to many great outcomes that will help members of society enjoy a better life style and have a safer future.

7539041C16DF,"American citizens know that the cars driven throughout America is polluting the air. Not just the cars in U.S but cars all around the world. Residents on Vauban in Germany, Paris, Bogota and even the USA cars are reduced from bieng driven or they had been banned to reduce the pollution from the air. They dont want to turn out like China, which is know as one of the most polluted cities in the word. Cars been a very help, but it looks like the end of car culture beacuse less cars that are bieng used less pollution we are causing to the Earth, which mean its better of with out them.

Vauban, a women named Heidrun Walter said, ""when i had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way"". There for one of the advantages of limiting car usage is that losing tense about a car. Also in Vauban,street parking, driveways and home garages generally are forbidden. That mean it take less space for parking, past two decades there was an effort in making cities denser, and better for walking now they can if they limite the usage of cars. It lower emissions and improves saftey, These are some advantages of limiting car usage.

Almost 4,000 drivers were fine, according to Reuters in Paris. They been fine beacuse Paris had banned driving due to smog. Trying to fix the problem to clear the air of the global city they ordered to leave thier cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Less cars mean less warmer climants beacuse cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Benfits would come from less car usage. Now in Bogota there is a car-free day, when u leave cars at home and you cant use them for a whole day. For that day there isn't any traffic because all of the residents are hiking, biking, skating or taking the bus to work. This car-free day reduce smog and if any person violats that day they are going to be fine $25. They said its a good way to take away stress and lower pollution. Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic.

ello fellow citezens , we are here to inform you about limit car usage. First driving to much can cause harm to the population . Second Germaney continue their lives with out cars . Last but not least driving to much can cause smog .

First let me say every minute of this day a type of car or truck is causuing damage to the wolrd with its gas . For example every morning I drive to school I see gas coming out from the exghust pipe from multiple cars . Every time a car turns on there a chance the world breaks down . Plants and tree dies slowly .

Next let me tell you about Germany how they live everyday with out usuing cars . For example , Seventy percent of the Vauban's family does not own a car . 57 percent sell their cars to move to a new area . How do they live or get to their destinantion ? Well let me tell you they either walk or ride bikes there . There are even commercial about tranpostation . They say it low emmisions and imprives safety .

Last but not least cars can cause smog . For example , In Bogota , Colombia people either hike , bike , skate , or even took buses to work . Colombia had bannded cars for the tird year . With only buses and taxis that were permitted only . The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog .

Violaters would face a twenty-five dollars fine.

675079638FD9,"Many people wonder whether or not cars should be ban to help save the enviroment. They dont know if that would help us or make matters worse. Their are many advantages to not using cars. Some people just can't seem to let go of their cars. They need a push to get started and to stop using their cars every single day.

Their are multiple advantages to the baning of cars. One example would be getting rid of air pollution. Most air pollution is caused by cars so if you get rid of cars you will also get rid of air pollution. Air pollution can cause a lot of different problems it can cause people to get sick or many other things, so getting rid of it completely could help a lot of people.

Another thing people wouldn't have to worry about would be traffic jams on the way to work. During the week some many people are trying to get to and from work at the same time it causes a traffic jam. People are often late to work because of this reason. So putting a ban on cars could help out with that. People could walk to and from work or ride a bike. This would limit the number of traffic jams and people wouldn't have to worry about being late to work.

If people walked everywhere instead of drove everywhere people would be getting a lot of exercise and that could help too. Cars make us seem lazy where we drive everywhere we want to go but if we walk or rode a bike that could help out in many ways. Walking could get things off your mind you could walk with a friend that way you can hangout and talk about things while you walk. Walking could relieve stress. It could calm you down and just make you relax for a few and forget about all your problems.

Putting a ban on cars could also help the town in which you live in, not only by limiting air pollution but it could boost town activity. New restaurants would be built, and more places to shop. People would spend money on other things besides gas for their cars. Town businesses would do better and make more money, also new businesses could form.

Also getting rid of cars could limit the amount of deaths every year. Many deaths every year come from car accidents, drunk drivers, people not paying attention and many other things. If everyone walked or rode bikes to the places they wanted to go that could get rid of many deaths that happen every single day. That would make the world safer in so many ways.

Getting rid of cars and not depending on cars for everything could be what this worlds needs to improve itself. This could take us one step closer to living longer, happier, and healthy lives. People wouldn't have to worry about getting a car or paying insurance on a car. People wouldn't have to worry about getting their kids license, teaching them how to drive or anything like that. The number of deaths each year could go down and things could change for the better.                     ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D4ECC2F45214,"""In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously"". Car redution helps the environment more than what people think it would. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitos assist from an incipient shift in America behavior:recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". Not having a car is better for you and the environment because not only would you be excercising by walking but there will be less pollution in the economy. Cars waste to much gas and have a lot of unnecessary waste in them that could end up to be one day global warming and kill of all the good air we breath in now. People should look in to not having a car and start walking, biking, skating and do more than what they use to do when they had a car.

Paris, Germany, United States, New York, Colombia and many other places are starting be more car free because they heard what cars can do to the environment. According the text "" in Colombia has a program that they started that spreads to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day the other day, leaving the streets of the capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"". The more and more people hear about this program the more people will get into the habbit of not havng a car or not using a car to go everywhere they have to go to. ""If the patterns persists and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source pf America's emissions, just behinfd power plants"".

Most people who are involved in the program see a huge difference in their community like the streets are cleaner, there are no traffic jams, the streets are safer, and there's less pollution in the air. As we all know that cars are sometimes important to us to get to where we need to get but is it really that important to us to have a car not really because if we would stop being lazy and just get up from our couches and walk, bike, or skate to where we needed to go we'll see that having a car is not as important as we used to think. In Colombia two other citizens joined the event and found that ""these people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing broders"". So really one program can change the whole world if people just joined and saw for them selves what a huge impact it can be on others.

More parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city and there are more smooth sidewalks and restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift"". New York also started there own program which is this biking-sharing program and it's skyrocketed bridge and the tunnel tools reflect those new priorities, and of course a proiferation of car-sharing program across the nation. In some cities you have to take a car like in San Francisco because everything is so far away and you can not walk to where you need to go it will take forever to get there walking which is understandable. But in other cities or places were everything is close to you then there's no point of taking a car instead of walking to the place you need to go to. Cars waste a lot of gas which means that gas prices go up way to much because of the usahe of cars instead of biking, skating, or walking. You get more done when your walking, biking, or skating because you are less worried about running out of gas or having to push the car to the nearest gas station.

Well imagine if we limited the usage of cars in our community! I strongly believe that doing this would have many advantages to our community for many reasons like it will make people less stressful all the time, there would be less accidents and it would definitly be better for the environment.

OMG I ran out of gas or OH my i have to take my car to the shop to get it fixed is usually the two main things you hear people stay when the word ""car"" comes up. Having a car comes with alot of stress because it of expenses and having to take of its every need and usually when someone is stressed they are not the best person you wanna have a conversation with.

""Car-free Cities""

by

Elisabeth Rosenthal in source 2 a lady name Heidrun Walter says "" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" and i think that is a perfect example of limited car usauage can make a person happier.

In addition, I feel that if that if we limit the car usage in our community it will make this community a much safer environment. We hear and see about many car accidents in our country and community and cars can be very very dangerous. People often get injuried and/or die in car recks to. So limitting the car usage in the communitry will keep people more safe and most importantly alive . Kids will be able to run aroumd the neighborhood and play with their friends and also cross the street safely without the disruption of a car coming and stopping them from what they are doing  because they do not wants to get hurt from the car coming because they do not know who is driving the car.

Last but not least limiting the use of car usage in the community because it would definitly be better for the environment. In science class we often talk about how cars polute the air and just mess up the waehter in the car and me my self i can also feel the car changing the more i see cars more cars in the streets. I think that it makes the days hotter and i also think that it makes the winters come around earlier and it makes it alot more colder. I live in the Sunshine florida and in the south. So all year round its usually hot extremly hot but has i realize more people are driving around the winers seem ALOT more cold then it usually is and the cold last for longer periods of time.

In conclusion, I belive that if we limit the car usuage in our community it will make it a better place for many reasons.

67268CDBEB25,"The use of cars has always affected society greatly. There are plans constantly being added to better the environment without the use of cars. Vauban, mentioned in Source 1, can be the start of the car-less world we want to live in. As this expiriment becomes noticed by the world, communities will realize how beneficial this experiment could be. Think about a world with no cars. There would be less pollution and less gasses being emitted into the air. For example, Pairs has just banned driving due to heavy smog. After about five days, car traffic was down 60 percent. Limiting car usage should be implemented heavily because of the greenhouse gas emissions and the happiness of the citizens of Vauban.

To begin with, cars cause many problems and the most important being the emissions of greenhouse gasses. As seen in Source 1, some of the car fillled cities of the United States suffer from up to 50 percect of greenhouse gas emissions. Well-populated cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago could be in great danger. A highly populated city in Colombia, has a ""Car-Free"" day. The goal of this is to allow people to open their eyes and realized how many alternative ways there are to go to work. The implimented a fee of 25 dollars to anyone who violated. I think that by adding a fee, the outcome would be greater and more people would participate. This is a great idea that would open people up to other options. For example, on the third year of the car free day, two other cities joined Bogota. Sometimes we have to open up the eyes of others to really see the change. Also, parks and recreational areas have opened up, uneven sidewalks have been referbished, and most importantly the city has less traffic.

Continuing with pollution, Paris had a near-record of pollution, seen in Source 2. This led to the ban of driving. The ban of driving could be refered to as the limiting of driving. They set up a plan in which cars with even-numbered license plates couldn't drive on Mondays. The same occured for the odd-numbered license plates on Tuesday. They heavily enforced this by implimenting a fine of 22 euros if they used their cars. This idea could work here in America. It would open up carpooling and lessen the amount of cars on the road.

People such as David Goldberg, mentioned in Source 1, are pushing for citites to be less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg mentions the hybrid car. Even though buying a hybrid does not reduce the amount of cars, it does reduce the amount of green house gas emissions.

Seeing the happiness and comfort that the people of Vauban allows us to see what our society could look like. We could live in a society just like theirs, filled with nature. In the United States, the number of licenses has been going down each year. Now, this does not automatically mean that American citizens want to ""be green"". It could be simply because of the fact that cars are expensive, and because we are living in a rough situation. In conclusion, I believe that we should limit car usage for the advantages of less pollution and less greenhouse gasses.                                             ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D12DFB2DD945,"Cars are a part of everyday life. You use them to drive to school, to work, out to eat, or to the movies with all of your friends. But what if you didn't have cars? What if you werent allowed to use them? Many places around the world, like Europe, Colombia, Paris, and even some parts of the United States, have started to end the car culture. This has proven to be very beneficial in keeping the earth clean, safe, and and healthy.

Greenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes in cars have been a big culprit in pollution. In paragraph 5 in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" it states cars are responsible for 12% of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in widely used car areas in the United States. In Paris, they inforced a partial driving ban to clear their air after near-record breaking days of pollution. Paris has more smog than other European capitals, having had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter, which compared to other paces like London, who only 79.9, that's a lot of smog. With limited driving, the pollution will decrease and benefit the environment over time.

Not only does the limited use of cars increase the overall health and safety of Earth, it helps keep us safe too. Multiple car accidents happen every single day around the world. As you would know, without cars, there would be no car accidents. Accidents such as these  can be caused by traffic. When driving on the highway with cars surrounding you, all going 70 mph, there's a high risk of getting into an accident.  During France's partial ban of cars, the congestion, or car traffic, was down 60% than normal. This lessened the chance of accidents and made the roads more safe, for both drivers/pasangers, and those walking along the streets.

Since cars would no longer be in use, how would you get around? In Columbia, many citizens hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during their car free day. Without the use of cars, Americans and others would actually get up and move to get to where they need to go, which isnt something that's common anymore. America is the most obese country in the world, with most of the top obese cities residing in Texas. Cars give us another excuse to not be active in our everday lives. If everyone had limited use of cars, everyone as a whole may get the daily exercise they need to say at a healthy state.

Although cars are useful to get us to the places we need to go fast, they are not required or needed. They let off gases that are harmful to our environment, can be hazardous to ourselves and others, and should be replaced to play against obesity and unwellness. The cons of cars outweigh the pros and everyone should be turning off their cars and stepping outside.                                                                            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
14D595C9D1E8,"Cars are one of the most iconic things about American culture. America ""is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""Mustang Sally..."" (source 4) From Mustangs to trucks America has it all and we, as a people, think of cars as a necessity in life and we see them all around us everyday. So what if our car usage was limited? It mght not be as bad as you think. Reducing our usage of cars has advantages such as bettering the environment and improving the structure of a city.

Reducing our use of the car would have numerous positive effects on the state of the environment around us. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gs emisions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (source 1) The pollution has gotten so bad in cities like Paris that they have even gone so far as to ""...enforce[d] a partial driving ban to clear the air..."" (Source 4) The havy car usage that we are accustomed to increases the amount of these harmful gases in the environment. ""...emisions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" (source 1) Reducing our usage, or even completely eliminating it, would improve our environment drastically and help maintain and lower the amount of pollution in the air.

There have been pioneering cities who have already started banning cars, even for just a day, like Vauban, Germany and Bogota, Colombia. The residents of  Vauban, Germany have done something no one before them has, they have given up their cars. 70 percent of the residents there don't even own a car anymore and have said that they are much happier this way. While some may say that the elimination of cars might be detrimental to car comapnies, there have been companies, like Ford, who have ""partner[ed] with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and oublic transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emisions,a nd improve safety'"" (source 4) In this town of Vauban, Germany public transportation has been made more accessible eliminating the need for a car, and in turn has made places like shopping malls more accessible on main roads. In Bogota, Colombia there has been a car-free day where people find other means of transportation like biking, walking, or buses to get around for the day. ""The goal is to promot ealternative transportation and reduce smog."" (source 3) Other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined Bogota in this event, also having a car-free day. This day has made changes throughout the city improving sidewalks, reducing traffic, openingv new shooping districts, and even constructing 118 miles of bicycle path. The effects of the reduction and elimination of car usage can be seen in these citys' sturctures and the improvements that have been made.

The limiting of car usage has been shown to be helpful to the environment and helps to better the structure of a city and like Bogota, Valledupar, and even Paris we should all take into consideration the positive effects that limited car usage would have on us.                                                                                                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
0CA2DD836BBA,"Cars have been around for ages now, people are constantly making new modles to make them better. But what were to happen if we took them away and we only relied on walking or riding bikes. There are three reasons why I blieve this would be a benefit for everyone. Picture it, a world without cars.

People believe cars to be a necessity, so they will be able to get from place to place but there are advantages to limiting the usage of cars in certain areas. For one it would reduce the amount of greenhouse gas, source 1 tells about a suburban town where there are no cars. It states that only 12 perecent of greenhouse gas emits in europe while in america it is up to 50 perecent. While Paris bans driving because of all the smog, statistics from source 2 show that Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter.

Following that, limiting the usage of cars can lower stress levels. In Bogota, Colombia they begin their 'Day without cars' for the thirs year straight. The citizens of Bogota were very coopertive of this. The mayor tells how even ""The rain hasn't stopped peole from participating"". Source 3 informs how even businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza rode a two seater bicycle with his wife and how he believes ""It's a good way to reduce stress and lower air polution."", as they countinue their newly found tradition other cities in colombia such as Cali and Valledupar join in on the event. Looks like Colombias program is starting to spread for the better.

Finally, bringing it back home to America on the advantages on limiting car usage. President Obama shares his plan to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas. Sources from article 4 tell how Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and how fewer are getting their license as the years go by, statistics show a large drop in the amount of 16 to 39 year olds getting their license. this article also tells how sociologists believe that if this countiues it will be beneficial for the enviornment. New York being one of the most populated states has a new bike-sharing program as well as car-sharing programs to help contribute to lessen the pollution and emission of greenhouse gases.

In Conclusion, while cars have been and are a great asset limiting the use of them could greatly benefit every one by using lessening stress levels, lowering pollution, and reduce the amount of greenhouse gas. Looks like we're already headed in the right direction.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
95EB945C6583,"A world of less pollution, less costly wages, reduced congestion on the roads, healthier ways to venture around, and less stress and danger. That would be a world with limiting car usage. May not seem like a rational idea but when you see all the good that could come out of the reduction of cars on the streets it could change your way of thinking.

A city in Germany by the name of Vauban, 70 percent of their families do not desire to have cars. Over half of the percentage of people had sold their cars just to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". Those were the words of a women by the name of Heidrun Walter who is a mother of two and is also a media trainer she finds bicycles and sound of children running about is a much more tolerant tone then the sound of a motor rolling by. The enviromentalists from the Enviromental Protection Agency favors the idea of car reduction. They stand for cars being limited would reduce pollution and be more friendly the mother earth. From the reduction of cars on the roads the congestion percent soared down a plump number of 60 percent. That's truely a magnificent amount.

I strongly believe that limitng the car usage would reduce death rates, reduce smog, put people in less tense moods keeping them more happy, and lastly reduce moeny going to greenhouse gas wages. More places worldwide should limit relying so much on cars, to allow us to function in daily life without them.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F5E4D811501C,"Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage is a very good idea. It can save a lot of money, keep pollution from happening,and keep people safe. If more people tend to save money because of cars, then they can buy more stuff. If more people save the enviornment people can have fresh air to breath in. Multiple resources have been found to support the idea that limiting car use can save a lot of money and make the enviornment safer.

For example, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states that ""As a result of buying a parking space for $40,000, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter."" This quote explains the troubles and tension that one has to deal with when having a car. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" When Vauban, Germany had cars, their bill went up higher for highways instead of other transports. People should start to use other means of transport instead of cars.

In ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, Robert helps explain the reason why driving should be banned. ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Paris is very smart to do that, because cars create pollution. The way that they partially banned driving is that ""Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" Atleast paris partially protected the eviornment instead of the whole enviornment having to be in pollution.

In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author supports the idea of limiting car usage for the concern of safety. Safety is a really important thing in life. Cars can limit the danger of getting in a car accident. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedistrians, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety."" If people did not have cars, then nobody would have to worry about accidents and their safety.

In conclusion, limiting driving and the usage of cars can improve the world. It can make it a safer enviornment, safe money, and stop pollution. These evidences from the excerpts can prove that limiting car usage is a really good idea.                        ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A9B4CF1F314A,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. These examples include, less stress, cleaner air, and more safety. There is less stress because you are always tense as stated in the first source. There's cleaner air because cars are one of the leading causes to air pollution as said in source two. There's also more safety because streets don't have as much traffic stated on source three and four.

One benefit of limiting car usage is that there is less stress. There is less stress because when you own a car you may find yourself tense a lot of the time or maybe all of the time. In source one, Hedrium Walter stated that she was always tense with a car and now she is much happier. Bike riding and walking outside can be relieving without the sound of motors, hearing the children play in the park and breathing the fresh air is much better. In source three Carlos Arturo Plaza said that car free day is a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution. This is another instance of someone supporting limiting car usage because there is less stress.

Cleaner air is another benefit to limiting car usage. Cars are one of the leading factors to air pollution, this is shown in source two. In source two, it states that congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France afer five-days of intenstifying smog. This proves that limiting car usage provides cleaner air for the enviroment. With cleaner air, there is a healthier poulation which is a benefit to limiting the usage of vehicles.

There is more safety with limiting car usage. If car usage is limited, then there aren't as many car accidents and there is less traffic. Less traffic could also lead to public transportation becoming more efficient and faster. The bus would be able to get to places much faster without other cars being in the way wich would be a benefit to limiting car usage.

Limiting car usage would be for the better of the population. It would cause less stress, cleaner air, and more safety. The usage of cars should be limited for the better of man and it should happen everywhere.                                                    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
39D4B36AFF57,"There are many reasons citizens should limit there car use and help our planet. First off in the first text I read someone says when they got rid of there car it reduced some of the tenseness they had and they felt happier. Also the cities who used less vehicles wouldnt feel as tight and over whelming.

In the second text i read it gave me many statistics on how using less cars would help us. One thing they stated was they banned certain vehicle license plates for a couple days and the smog percenatge went down as low as 60 percent. Also car pooling or hybrid cars were fine because it helped the cause of less smog.

In the third source I read through it helped me understand the importance of not using your car often. They banned car usage that day besides buses and taxis which is hard to follow through especially on a rainy day so many people got finned. In the text they said its a goo dopportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. After hearing about this many other cities started joining in on the movement to help reduce pollution, which they did do. Also the park centers and pitted sidewalks have imporved tremendously.

During the last article I read it really opened my mind to riding bikes, walking or even car pooling. It talks about since the market crashed people didnt have enough money to buy cars and pay for gas. This made me think how much money you could save if you stopped driving. You could do so many other things without paying for a car and its gas money.

So overall I think we should reduce our driving because we could reduce pollution, save money and if it has to come to it you can car pool with a group of people.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A409EF8030EC,"Car usage around the world has skyrocketed pollution levels tenfold. In Paris, France they had to ban driving for 2 days to help clear out the fog in the city (Source 2). Some cities have even stopped using cars altogether, many of the townspeople believe that cars just cause more stress in peoples lives (Source 1).

In Colombia, the Day Without Cars is becoming more and more popular each year. It's a great way to lower stress and air pollution (Source 3)!

Since 2005, car usage in America has gone down every year, with less people getting a license and less cars being bought each year (Source 4). It begs the question: are cars growing away from our culture? Many people would rather use public transportation or car-pool with friends than drive to work or other activities. Public transportation traffic is woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety (Paragraph 43).

So maybe you should ask yourself if driving really is the best way to go, because it only causes stress, pollution, and it's a danger to your safety every time you drive onto the road. Maybe it's just best to limit car usage and pull out the old bicicle or take the bus and meet new people.                ",1,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Pollution is destroying our ozone and our environment, but now we need to face our ramifications. Autos are causing cities to form new laws banning these leeches from being driven. Car usages should be limited, because if we dont, our pollution will be worse than it already is, and using a healthy alternative to transportation will lead to a healthier life style.

Pollution produced by our main method of transportation is killing our planet. We live on the wonderful planet earth which has been generous to provide us with a home and food so we can survive, but when our home is destroyed, we will soon become extinct. Global warming is a famous term heard around the globe, and this word is not used lightly. Our world is heating up due to the many green house gasses produced by the emisions of the cars we use. These green house gasses can not escape our atmosphere which then is heated up by the sun and is melting our polar ice caps. These ice caps, not only will flood multiple cities, killing thousands if they do not escape in time, but they also hold our natural fresh water reserve. The green house gasses are affectng our seas and our skies as well. An article called

[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Beijing is also one of the worlds most populated countries. The terrifying smog and the rising seas are not the only factors leading to our demise. The green house gasses are producing holes in our ozone that protect us from harmful sun rays. Without the ozone, the world would not be habitable because of all the cancer humans will have by just standing in direct sunlight. We are the world, and by killing the world, we eradicate our whole species. We need to help our world with some healthy substitutions to cars.

There are several different ways transporation could be healthy for both the enviroment and ourselves. The worlds obeisity population is higher than ever. An average amount of calories we need to consume per day is about 2000 calories and most of the world are consuming way over that limit. If we supply bicycles to cities, we could burn off those extra calories by just going to public places, events,and even jobs. Biking and walking to places not only work out your physical apearance, but also keeps our mind healthy. Exercise trigger neurotransmitters in your brain to fire off endorphins, like adrenaline, which keeps your body moving and working without putting strain on your muscles. Exercise also fires off dopamine in your mind which produces a sense of joy. Elisabeth Rosenthal wrote an article named ""

If you had to choose from killing yourself slowly or making the world healthier by walking instead of taking a car what would you choose? Many people don't understand the damage that driving all of the time is doing to our world. But, limiting car usage has many advantages that come along with it.

Limiting car usuage come along with many advatages. One advatage of limiting car usage is that you can limit the amount of smog that goes into the air and also into your lungs. In source 2 it says, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31)."" That is a very good choice of action because without hearing that they would have any concequences people still would have drove their cars. In source 2 it also says, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" So, by limiting car usage just by the even numbered license plates there was less smog in just one day. In source 2 it says, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" So, the success of just one day made people want to do it a second day with just the odd-numbered license plates. If they keep this up and eventually have a day where neither odd nor even numbered license plates can drive the smog will eventually clear all the way up.

Also, another advantage to limiting car usage is there won't be many traffic jams. In source 3 it says, ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this captial city eerily devoid of ttraffic jams,"" meaning that everyone got around easily without all of the congestion in the roads. In source 3 it also says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said the businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife."" Traffic jams tend to cause alot of people stress. People stress because they can't get to important places on time, they spend hours on the same highway, etc. By limiting car usage, they limit their stress and have a good day instead of being so angry just because of traffic which will help them out in the long run because alot of stress isn't good for the body.

There are many more advantages to limiting car usage. In source 4 it says, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" By just taking the little time to figure out a different, less polluting way of transportation all of these advantages come out of it.

Many people don't understand the damage that driving all of the time is doing to our world. But, limiting car usage has many advantages that come along with it. A way that I could pitch in would be to ride the school bus with everybody else instead of driving myself to school. Some advantages to that would be using less gas, saving money and carpooling so that there are less cars on the road and less air pollution, because we need the air to stay clean so we can breathe and stay alive. So by limiting car usage we can have many good things happen to our lives and to our world .    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Overall, most countries including America, have seen changes in their economy. [T]he number of miles driven in 2005 dropped..."" and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway, [b]ut by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way"" (paragraph 32).

Car companies like Ford and Mercedes rebranded their businesses (around the world, as it is Ford is an American car and Mercedes is a German car) (paragraph 32).

One reason the cities without cars are better is because cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. diesel fuel was blamed since france has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up sixty seven percent of vehicles in frane, compared  to a fifty percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western Europe.

Paris typically has more smog than the other countries so that means they have more cars. cars produce way too much smog because of automobiles. we should all just stop driving cars when its not necessary because the earth is gonna become trash because of it. public transit was free of charge from friday to monday according to BBC.

Many countries are eliminating cars and making people walk to work, school and the mall or somewhere else. In Vauban, Germany every one has given up their cars, the streert parking, parking lot, and garages are forbidden. Almost everyone goes walking or they ride their bicycle. Vauban is a ""car-free"" city. Many people sold their cars to move in Vauban, so that they can live peacefuly and not be so stress over a car. Cause of this idea almost every country is starting to do this. This will help the world to be a better place.

In Paris,France, they have ban driving due to smog. Paris has been recording the pollution and they have realize that it got out of controlled. People who drives motocycle they would be fined, they would have to pay $31. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to the agency. Car traffic when down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog. Diesel fuel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. Paris has more smog that any other European capitals. Scientists have found that Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, that is the highest compared to London and Brussels. Now the smog had cleared enough because of the ""car-free"".

In Bogota,Colmbia, Car-Free day is spinning into a big hit. People that live in Colombia hike,bike,skate or take buses due to the Car-Free. It has been three years that Colombia have been doing these. They banned cars except buses and taxis in the capital city of 7 million people. Their goal is to remove smog and to promote alternative transportation. Colombians that dont not participate and use their car will get fined and they would have to pay $25. Carlos Artura Plaza says ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower pollution"". He rides his two-seated bike with his wife every day when they have Car-Free day. Other cities from Colombia decide to participate on this event. This campaign had started in the mid-1990s, over 118 miles of biclyce paths have been created.

In recent studies, Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes. Last yera a study was found that young people driving has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. In USA there has been a large drop in percentage of 16 to 39 years olds getting a license.

EA8C1757ACE0,"There area couple of advantages to limiting car usage. The most common one would be less pollution. In larger cities pollution is a big deal with all the factories around, but some of that pollution can be redused if less car were used for transportation. To help reduse pollution, as stated in source 1 ""[S]tores are placed a walk away, on main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.""

One way to enforce limiting car usage is to do like it say in source 2 ""after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" People were did not agree with the concept of not driving for the day in the begining and decided that instead of go along with not driving they would rather pay the fine, ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined..., says source 2. The only car that was allowed to drive from Friday to Monday was plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. source 2 says ""the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.""

Another advantage to limiting car usage is that there are less traffic jams. ""[M]illions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took the buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams,"" says sorcure 3. Not driving to work and using alternate transportation is ""...a good opportunity to take away stree and lower air pollution,"" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

In source 4 President Obama said ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" most people seem to be understand and realizing the advantanges of limiting car usuage. in some cases you may think car are very important to our lives, which they are but in other cases they are not.

there would be less polluation in the air and that would make the air better for us to breath.

Sure by limiting the usage of cars would have an effect on people its also doing us a favor wether we like it or not, because constsntly breathing in polluated air is really bad for you it can have major affects on our lungs, and respotory system. Also by limiting car usage you wouldent spend so much money on gas, oil, car parts,ect:, so by saving all that money you could spent it on something else.

When you own a vehicle you put in so much money in just getting your insurance and then you spend so much money on gass every week, dont get me wrong the gas prices have gone down but what will happen when they go back up and how much money will the gas be then?

So is driving worth killing your air and the enviroment you live in and spend all your money on gas?

Or would it better for us to start imiting our car usage?

But that is up for you to decide what you want to do.

Whe driving have you ever thought how much polluation you vehicle is dishing out while your driving around town? Probably not, probably you where thinking how log till i get there or i need to text someone back but i bet not once did car polluation ever cross you mind and its okay not alot of people think about it when there driving. Actually hardly anyone thinks abot it ever unless its on the news saying that the air polluation is bad again and thats when you start to think about it.

With car polluation ypu dont realse what it is dont to you enviroment because you never see it happen in a fast pace it always happen really slow.

All of a sudden plants will start to die really fast, people will have areally hard time breathing and will probably have to go to the hospital because of the lack of oxygen they can get.

Imagine saving you money, wouldent that be nice not having to worry about a car paymeny or gas?

alot of people would have so much money that alot of them nedd because there is alot of families struggling to make it by the have to constantly worry if they have enough money to pay the bills and put gass in there vehicle to get to work to make the money to survie.

03A78D9FF84F,"Many people believe that owning and using a car or other motorized vehicles is an advantage. But is it really? Citizens might be able to get somewhere faster or not have to exert the energy to get there. But is it worth polluting the air, taking up all that space and creating traffic and frustrated citizens, and creating the mindset of a lazy, human being? Maybe instead of spending money on a car, citizens wouldn't be in as much debt, some kids might have college already paid for, and some citizens have their housing paid for. Therefor, this is making happier, stress-free, citizens.

The pollution of the air is a major arguement for people who support the non-usage of cars or other motorized vehicles. In Source 1: In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal claims that motorized vehicles play a major part in the pollution of the air. Rosenthal says that Europe is responsible 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and the United States is resposible for up to 50 percent.

Most of the time, traffic causes a driver to be frustrated. What causes traffic? Vehicles. So why does everybody drive them? In small, well-populated suburbs, traffic is a major issue. With the dense population and the majority of those citizens driving vehicles, traffic is very easily created. Thus, making more citizens frustrated and creating road rage. Road rage also causes more accidents which causes more deaths. Making driving, a dangerous thing. Although, citizens still drive motorized vehicles. Most of the time it is to get to a certain place in a short amount of time, but if a destination is closer than one mile, there is no excuse to use a vehicle to get there. But most citizens do. This creates a lazy mind set.

The average cost of a brand new car is roughly $30,000. If citizens avoid buying a car, it would be a great benifit for them. $30,000 can payoff college, or help with bills or debt, or payoff housing. With more money, this creates happier, and less stressed citizens.

The creation of ""car dues"", and ""car-free days"" could make a huge difference in the environment, economy, saftey, traffic, and even the health and stress of a citizen. Although most people still believe that having a car is an advantage, it can be. But not having a car or not using a car as much is a much greater advantage. Not just to an individual, but to society as a whole.                    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

If we didn't use cars and we just got around by walking , riding a bike , a school bus , a city bus or even taking taxis it would be easier . It would save us time and resources . It would aslo , lower the emissions . Lastly , it would improve our safety .

If our world was car free , it would save us time and help conserve resources . How? We would all be on a schedule and we wouldn't have to do things at different times and end up being late to work , or to school , or even to something very important . You wouldn't have to worry about wasting time fixing your car while you could be at a job interview or getting a scholarship . A car is a lot of responsibilty , believe it or not . We wouldn't have to depend on our friends or parents to car pool us .

According to David Goldberg all of the development since World War Two has been centered on cars . Back in the day , they used to walk or ride on carrages with horses and carts . Now we have motor vehicles that runs on gasoline , deisel , or even a battery . Who ever invented these things made it easier for us , but now they're going out of hand with it because there is alot of traffic and very many car accidents . Wihout cars it could be a good opportunity to take away stress and to lower air population . Studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars , driving less , and fewer licenses are being purchased .

Safety is a very important role in our lives , right ? If you want to be safe at all times and not have to worry about someone drinking and driving or someone being on a high speed chase and crashing into you , you should deffinitly think about being car free . There are at least about 5 accidents a week because of people not paying attention to where they're going or even just because people like to take driving as an advantage . If there were less cars in the world , there would be less death rates . Someone could be dying in an ambulence and all the traffic could be stopping them from staying alive , when they could be to a hospital and cured .

While people are driving around trying to fight traffic just to get to work or a doctors appoitment you could already there . Many people don't like to walk or maybe even ride a bike because either they're lazy or they just don't care about their health . But there are many other options , such as taking a city bus , a train , a taxi , and maybe even a sub .

But does anyone think about what these traving pieces of machinerary do to our planet? Cars are producing a enviormentally harmful fumes such as greenhouse gas, and smog . These two chemicals are harmful for our ecosystems, as well as our health. It is unnessacary that people should be allowed to kill not only the nature that surrounds us, but also themselves so we need to become a car-free nation.

Giving up driving is like giving up a bad habit, you always have the urge to do it again. But is it all worth it. Think about it, you get up for wor, or school and you walk outside where the sun is shining and the birds are chirping and you think ""Wow it is beautiful out here"". And what do you do... you insert your self into a small metal barrier stoping you from being one with nature. so where am I going with this you might ask. ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way."" says Heidrun Walter, a mother of two who gave up her car and decided to walk. When you are driving you can not say hello to your friends, or nighbors. In fact you cant have any social contact which is not healthy.

The U.S. is one of the largest producers, and consumer of motorized transportation devices. Companys such as Ford, Chevy, Jeep, and Lincon are producing cars that no one could refuse. But are they safe? Car companys advertise that they are ""safe"". Airbags, seatbelts, even blind-spot protection moniters are some of the advances in vehical safety technology, but technology does not alway work correctly. Most death tolls are not by murder, or suicide, but by car accidents. So why is it that all this technology that engineers are putting in our auotmobiles are not saving lives? This is why walking or running or cycling is an ideal chioce of transporation, and why automoblies should come to an end.

Im not saying that all cars should be throw into a scrap yard and be forgot about.

BEFEAAA5B388,"Limited car usage has plenty of advantages. A few examples of advantages that come from limited car usage are lessining the amount of gases polluting the air, also it would create a friendly and neighborly enviorment, and a large amount of money would be saved.

To limit car usage has huge benefits; we can lessen the gasses that are polluted, lessening smog. It may not sound like something that effects your everyday life, but it does. Smog and air pollution are a problem, and a threat to our safety and well being. As of right now it is'nt a life or death situation, but if car usage continues to be a huge part of the world, all the air pollution from all the years of driving are going to get so bad people, and the earths atmosphere will be extremly affected by it. Think about your kids future, would you really want them to live in a world consumed by air pollution, and emission gasses, and smog.. To give an example, ""passneger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe.. and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states"" (rosenthal). That just showing how much car usage affects air pollution and the air we breath everyday. Just decreasing the amount of car usage can reduce the smog, and air pollution in cities and towns.

Additionally, the less cars are used the more people and neighbors would intteract. If a majority of a town just lessened the amount they go out using a car, they would walk, or ride bikes, or take busses, etc.. imagine your town, and families and their kids taking a walk somewhere, or people riding their bicycles to their destination, everyone could meet their neighbors and talk. Overall, cities and towns and suburben areas would generally become just a friendly enviorment. Most people want to live in a place in which they feel safe and neighborly. Teenagers and families would get more excersise then the normal. Due to having to walk, and ride bikes or other things they would be getting out of the house more instead of sitting in a car then going and sitting some place then going back home and sitting around again, they would get the needed physical activity to stay some what healthy. ""Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day""(selsky). That is amazing, and it is so good for people to get out and do things like that. Lessening car usage could completly change neighborhoods and towns and citiies.

Finally, Cars in the united states are highly expensive, and not everyone has thousands of dollars around to get the car they want/need. ""Cash strapped americans could not afford new cars""(Rosenthal). Just an example that cars are not cheap and a lot of people spend money they do not have on cars. In addition to buying the car, gas must be provided, depending on the car and the amount of gas it uses up, that can be pretty expensive. Insurance is another cost, everyone has to have insurance to be able to drive and own a car, thats a monthly fee coming out of our pockets. Limiting car usage could save a lot of money, it would leave extra money every day, week or month to go out and eat once in a while, or to buy other necisities. Just about everyone wants to have a little extra money, but with a car thats frequently used can use up almost 200 to 400 dollars each month. Riding a bike, or skateboarding or just simply walking is completly free.

Advantages in limited car usage are, The decrease in gas pollution and smog, it could create friendlier neighborhoods and towns, and lastly thousands of people would save a lot of money.                                 ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
91207DE7B9B3,"There are so many advantages of limiting car usage. In source one, the Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"". This is for the good of not cluttering the streets with so many cars but actually making more space and less cars on the streets. In source one, it says ""while there hace been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the cocept to the suburbs."" That right there says they have been trying to reduce car usage for a while now and convince citizens that transportation can be better to use. Instead of having over a million cars on the streets or high ways or anywhere, many people can come together and take transportation train or bus to where ever they need to go. It also makes time for walking, which is a very good exercise. Many people have become lazy and take their car to drive to the store thats right there on the corner instead of walking. Many people have taken car usage over the limits and don't realize how it is polluting our air.

Pollution is a big problem in our ecosystem now and days. Many people don't clearly see this and don't take the time to process in how bad its making earth. Pollution has gone up over the years and decades after decades we have tried to stop it. In source two, it says ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals."" Why? Well because of the exaggerated use of cars. They have tried to reduce the usage in order to make their air cleaner and better. They have gotten the idea of limiting car usage by ordering people with even-numbered license plates to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine on Mondays. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. With this new policy, it has shown better air in the city of Paris by Monday. I believe this is a great forced rule. We need to change our ways and work better in making our air cleaner.

Traffic jams is another downfall of using cars. With so many cars out in the streets it causes the air to have so much smog. Many people have participated in bike riding and walking, but not only is it exercise for your health but it keeps away from people using their cars. With so many people participating this action, not only has it made better air burt also constructed and cropped up new restaurants and shopping districts. They cleared the side walk to make it smoother and cut traffic, as said in source three. This is all in Bogota, Columbia. They said it has made a drastic change in their community with better air and I believe it has made their air better and way reduced smog.

In the United States, President Obama's goal was to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. This has led to many people participating in this action. A very big amount of Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and fewer licences as each year goes by as said in source four. To keep this at a going rate each year I believe citizens should work harder to improve more in this situation as in car pooling, bicycle and public transportation.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages in reducing car usage. Better air, better community and healthier citizens.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E0AC5BD00F8F,"Limiting car usage would make a huge impact on the world today, cars are the cause for most of the 12 percent of greenhouse gas in the U.S, also by limiting cars people would buy less, and ride more, as well as clear the air their breathing on a daily basis.

First off, Cars are known for their release of gas into our atmosphere, making it warmer. According to Elizabeth Rosanthol of the New York Times in source one, cars are the main cause for up to 50 percent of the worlds greenhouse gas emission. Germany has taken an act to this issue and given up their cars. People who are caught driving can actually get a sitation and up to a 25 dollar fine. Which is definitely making an impact on our world today, and for the future.

To second that, limiting car usage would save citizens alot of money, like New Yorks new bike-sharing program for people trying to shift the driving population. This bike program has caused an enormous drop in percentage of people getting their license, because why get it when you can ride a bike? Teens in between 19 and 21 have also not made it a priority to get their license, because organizing their life around where they can walk or take public transport is alot cheaper and better for the environment.

Last but certainly not least, Paris has enforced a partial driving ban because of all the smog in their global city. Everyone was ordered to leave their vehicles at home, and the ones who disobeyed would get a 22 euro fine, or 31 dollars. Congestion went dont 60 percent in a five day period, making it less stressful for drivers or pedestrians to get to their destination. Diesal fuel was blamed for the smog and with 60 percent less cars clogging up the atmosphere it cleared up in a matter of time and effort.

Limiting car usage would have a bigger impact than you think, just by leaving your keys at home you could be saving or globe from greenhouse gas, saving your money, and saving your lungs from the harsh smog it causes in France.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
C07E401B76E1,"Limiting car usages is a way to help people and the environment all around us. limiting car usage can have lots of effects,there are advantages and disadvantages of limiting car usage. disadvantages of limiting car usage would be to release greenhouse gases in the air and contaminating the surface,and people breathing the muggy air, or smog. advantages for limiting car usage is when someone wants to go somewhere on time and they have thie own viechile and they can control the car to where they want to go.

Communities are trying to find way not to have gases in the air and to reduce the uses of modern transportation. people try not to use cars alot and instead they do other things to get to places like taking a bus, bicycling,running,skating and things like that. using those resources will decrease gases in the environment and people can relax and breathe in fresh air instead of gases. gases are toxic to natural influences and can damage them.

Disadvantages of limiting car usage is to release lots of gases and smog,therefore makeing the environmets a hazardous place to be in. people can get sick from inhaling the smoke or they could die if they breathe in too much. thats why people should try not too use transportations any day to make the environmets a healthy and clean place for poeple to live in and to enjoy.

Advantages of limiting car usage would be to use cars or other transportation because someone might want to go somewhere and its a long distance,people could drive to  thier destination,and on time if they have somewhere to be like a buisness or a meeting the person needs to attend. If they took the bus the trip might last longer if the person is in a rush to get somewhere. Thats for long distace,for short dstances, people could take the bus to go somewhere close by or walk to the place. you could get somewhere faster if you walk and there is traffic,you would be stuck for a while if you were driving,only in heavily dense populated area would that most likely to happen,it would release lots of smog to the environment when lots of cars are in one place.

In places in the world lots of people are contributing to not using transportation to get to places but instead they are using non-gas usable transportations  like bikes and skates to get to place to place. people also walk, it is a good exercize for people to do and it is a healthy influence. other people might see someone do it and they might want to do it as well. the best thing to do to save the environmet from hazard gases is to use gas transportations less and use physical transportation,like walking it would be better to do than to realease fumes in the air people breathe and hurt their body. So if someone wanted to go to the store and its close by, instead of taking a transportation walking would be healthier and more benificial for the environment and people around you.                         ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
6BEC8B1F709C,"Driving is a way of getting around quicker and to get to places you need to go, ever since the first car was mass-produced it has cuased a social drift where now in this generation almost all people use a car to get anywhere. Driving is fun and is a helpful way, but imagine if you had to lower the amount of time you would spend in you car, it wouldnt be the end of the world the only negative effect of not using your car is taking more time to get there and excersising. A car releases fumes into the air which cuases air pollution, driving is one big reasons why we have global warming. According to researchers people in Car-Free communities feel less stress without their cars, becuase having a car is a responsibility;buying gas, not denting/scratching the car, and ofcourse keeping it clean. Driving is everywhere and has been here for awhile, driving has also sadly played a role in deaths across the nation, Driving under influence, foolishness, accidents and so on and so fourth. Maybe less driving isn't such a bad idea after all, there are already countrys that practice less car usage, even car-free days.

When you have a car its a whole new world and responsiblitys you will have and you'll have to maintain it, but driving is not the only way of getting around, there is running and bicicyles and walking which are all healthy options, maybe next time we you need to go to the local store you can take a bike or run there yourself and save gas and lessen air-pollution, ofcourse one trip without a car won't save the world but its a start. This generation is closely tied to using cars and most of them don't think that when they use a car the effects it has on using a car. Cars have been a great invention but now their starting to become a life-style. One of the common results of driving is traffic it is seen all over the place and takes up time and cuases stress among drivers, less driving would clear up the roads and lessen stress for others and be a/n open oppurtunity for others to get healthy.

Cars make up around 50% of greenhouse gas in the United States and cars are a nasty contributer to Global warming the fumes of the cars go in the air and get trapped there and hurt the ozone layer, also gasoline a source we find underground which we are using more and more than we get and it is a non-renewable resource, we break down mountains just to find this resource. Oil has cuased political disputes and the loss of forest,enviorments and more. When a car is destroyed it is sent to the scrapyard which is a big land just for destroyed cars and it takes up space, and it once could have been a nice forest. Car usage also is the producer of smog, sometimes smog is so bad in countrys they would have to ban car-usage for a number of days; that means we are abusing cars just a little too much.

Lastly, Car-Free is not new or scaring it actually is a rising trend countrys have done Car-Free day and the culture is spreading across the areas, being outside without a car using a bike or skateboard is a nice calm and relaxing way to spend a day and thousands of people seem to think so too, statistics say in the US the amount of cars being bought is slowly declining and driving less and the amount of licenses being optained is too. In some states there bike sharing programs and communities without cars. Car-Free communties are a great way to save enviorment, lessen air pollution and to connect the community together instead of passing by taking a walk and or taking a bike ride with someone you would want to be with, and instead of hearing the constant sound of a motor engine hear the sound of children at play. Lessening car-usage can save money, less stress, and make you view things in a different perspective or even Car-Pool so others don't have to use their cars.

if we do what they did in vauban in the united states we could cut down on the greenhouse gasses and make citys more breathable. make them it better for people to get around and use less space for highways and malls. or we can fine people when they use cars and that would really cut down on the gas.

less and less people are not getting there licences because the have no reason to when thay can just car pool and the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. the rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down 2 or 3 befor the down turn. if it persists many sociologists believe it will have benefical implications for carbon emissions and the environment. there are shifts in the driving population that have droped suggest that the trend may accelerate.

like in paris that fined people $31 for driving. and exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carring 3 or more people. but public transport was free. in the city diesel fuel was blamed, it makes up 67% of vehicles in france. compaired to a 53.3% average for the rest of western europe. paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in brussels and 79.7 in london in conclusion the advantages of limitating car usage is a good thing.1 it cuts down on greenhouse gasses. 2 fines help over all. and 3 licence rate is droping.

Almost everyone has a car, or adleast knows someone who does. Unfortunatley, in German Suburbs life goes on without cars. The Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"" so the article says. They say car owner ship is allowed but there are only two places to park, large garages but that would take up to $40,000. Also, along with a home. 70% of people in the Vaubans family believe that life is better with out cars, of course they do not own cars. 57% sold a car to move here.

Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs spread-out homes and private places (such as garages, homes, etc) They were the dream towns of 1950s and still and exert a stong appeal. But some new suburbs look like the Vaubans. Not only in developed countries but also in the developing world. The United States, the Enviornmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communties. Meaning the lack of usage with cars. In previous bills, 80 percent or appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent go towards other transport. On Monday, motorists were ordered to leave there cars ar home or suffer a fine of $31.

In German they dont really care for cars "" Street parking, dirveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new districton the outskirt of Freiburg, near the french and Swiss borders."" there roads and sidewalks are mainly free they dont to many cars in German. The only people that was really allowed to have cars were car owners, but but there were ony 2 places to park ""Large garages at the edge of the development that casted $40,000 along with a home."" Some people felt like they were always tense when they had a car, they like not having a car so they wouldn't have to pay for the high gas they need for their gas tank. They felt like walking was way better, it was an exercise and it was more calming then being stuck in traffic.

Paris bans driving because to many people are getting smoggeled.""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" If they were caught driving they would be getting a fine a really big fine. ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters, 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fines.""

448730021DE2,"Limiting car usage is a great idea. If this ever does happen it will be a new Revolution for us all. Some might say that its outragious and unthinkable but it will benefit us in many ways. If we limit car usage there will be less polution, less stress, less traffic, more outside activities which means being healthier and last but not least it will be safer.

To begin with, with limited car usage there will be less polution and less stress. Most of our polution comes from cars, the smoke that the engine of the car lets out causes it. For example, Paris suffered a ""near-record pollution"" (source 2) due to the diesel. But after they enforced a fine of 22- euro ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France""(source 2). Don't you think that this is a positive outcome and this is benefiting us? Polution is a very important issue in the United States and we need to fix it or at least try. Now lets talk about stress, everybody has stress even if its from school, work, family ect. And everybody wants to have the least amount of stress as possible or no stress at all. If we limit the car use that will be taking a stress away from oneself, ""when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,""(source 1). Because that way parents dont have to worry whether their kids will get home safely. They wont have to worry about if they got into an accident, if after the pary they drived home intoxicated. Car accidents are very common in the United States and has caused many deaths so why not reduce that number,of deaths, and reduce car usage in the process? And not only for parents ,but elderly's as well  because some senior citizens still drive with or without license and that could cause a mayor incident.

Furthermore, by redusing car usage there will be more outdoor activities which means that it will be a lot more healthier. Think about it, by driving a car you dont exercise but if a person walks to a place, they are exersicing. For example, in German Suburb people have a limited car usage and you can hear the ""swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occassional distant motor""(source 1). The person could hear the outside activity and not the sound of cars passing by which means there was interaction between folks. Also, ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city...""(source 3) and isnt the government,especially Michelle Obama, trying to always give out messages of not only eating helathy but playing outside and interact with the community? well this is one way we can support that. Plus in this 21st century kids are always on their phones, tablets, computer and when they go out its to hang out with friends at the movies a party but they use cars. If the car usage is limited they wont have that many options and they could interact outside of their little ""bubble"". What ever way you look at this its gonna be a positive outcome even if its small.

Moreover, by reducing car usage there will be definetely less traffic and it will be a new beginning. To prove this points, in Bogota, Colombia ""million of Colombians hiked, biked, skated ot took buses to work during a car- free day yesterday, leaving the street of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (source 3). People hate traffic, it has not been known a person that doesnt. So, reducing car usage is equal to reducing traffic jams, why not do it then? Now it was never said  that there will be absolutely no cars just the decrease with it. There will be public transportations like taxis and buses but even if those where still be able to be used there wont be as much traffic. It is understandable that people sometimes need to get to places where you cant really walk to get there so the public transportation will be permitted. Also this will mean a ""new beginning"", Enrique Riera, mayor of Praguay said ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing boreders,"" (source 3). This statement says it all a ""revolutionary change"" its what we need. People are depending in cars so much and thats not good.

To end this thoughts, it is a great idea to limit the usage of cars. People will have one less thing to worry about and who woulnt like that huh? Also it will be healthy for the environment and the citizens and lets not forget, there will be less of a traffic jam. Plus it will be a big change but at the same time it wouldnt because statistics have shown that "" Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (source 4). So it already started little by little we just have to accelerated the process a bit more.""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly  9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995"" (source 4),just think about all the positive outcomes of this change.

1CA539E21E08,"In the world we live today, almost everyone owns a car; or even two. The amount of people  in the streets going to work and to school is excessive. This is a real issue that is almost not discussed. There are cities in the U.S. that have more cars than there are people in the city, like in L.A., which is something excessive. It would be good to not use cars once in a while. That's why, some countries are doing an event every year where they don't use cars all day. And they'd have to pay a fine of 25$ if they violated the rules.

We have been using cars for a long period of time, and we will keep using them for much more, but it would really help if we did not use them as much. Because sometimes there is so much traffic, is better to walk. When you own a car, you get stressed out. We all hate those ""Bad Drivers"" and we get angry when they are stopping us or blocking our way, and that gives us stress. Sometimes you relay so much on your car that you even use it to go around the corner, and this does not help your economy at all.

Driving so much isn't helping the environment either. A lot of european cities have smog due to the pollution of so much cars, so they were forced to ban all cars that had odd-numbered plates from driving. If less people were to drive, there would be much less pollution. I don't think it would hurt anyone to walk once in a while.            ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
58D15433E622,"Have you ever thought about the advsantages of limiting car usage and as well as giving up cars inorder to help the communities out there to live a better safisticated life, without the use of cars?. A plan created called smart planning involves the reduce or car usage helping the world also reduce bad pollution, and traffic jams. This way more transportation will be provided for other cases or people in need of that. In Germany, Paris, Bogota and the United States there are many reasons being caused to reducing cars due to jepordise it can cause such as pollution, traffic jams, space and transportation. In all these countries there are the different reasons to why cars should be banned.

To begin with, in Germany a district in Freiburg near the French ans Swiss borders cars have been givin up by people. Pepole are claiming to be more happy with their newly lifestyle of not using a car. Before they were using a car they also claimed that everything had felt more tense. Now that cars are banned in the district there has been more free space for pedestrians to walk. There has been more availabale roads and stress that are not packed anymore. There is space to build. Before cars had taken control over the roads and stress not proving areas and space to walk in. Middle class were choking cities meaning that their Cars were just taking way too much space. Cars are responsible for the greenhouse. Knowing that passanger cars are also reposible for twelve percent of the greenhouse gas. protection agencies are promoting car reduce as well as communities that are less dependent on cars. Vauban's streets are car free. 70 percent of vaubans families are also car free. The driveways, street parking and garages are all fobidden in that district.

However, Paris has faced another jepordising problem due to smog. Paris has been known to have the most smog than the rest of the European capitals. Due to this problem cars have been banned in order to clear the air pollution causing danger. This bad pollution can lead to sickness, weather changes that are bad and may cause people to inhale bad oxygen. People were commanded to leave their license plates at home or risk to pay a 22 euro fine that equals to 31$ dollars in American money. So far 4,000 people have paid this fine for not following this law. With this progress the pollution has cleared from Paris and has now gone to another place.

Innitially, traffic jams are a common problem in our everyday life. In Bogota, they face traffic jams and pollution. For this cause the citizens of Bogota have banned the usage of cars only allowing busses and taxis to be used. They have placed transportation instead of cars. People whp violate these rules are permitted to to pay a 25$ dollar fine. The reduce of cars in Bogota has helped clear the roads and make a dramastic change that has to do with the traffic jams they had been facing. Since there has been so much rain every single day in Bogota the air pollution has been reduced. People who visited Bogota had been mesmerized to the changes there has been of less pollution and traffic jams. Seeing the country all coaporate in this change.

Therefor, in the United states there has been a change of people reducing the use of cars. There has been a reduce in miles driven due to people who cant afford getting a car or paying for one. Childrens have not bothered to get a license because they had started to use bycicles, walking and transportation to get to their destination. There has been a major drop of 16 to 39 years old that didn't bother getting their license. Creating car pools is one of the greates way to reduce car usage. Communication also plays a role in this change. Having cell phones and communicating more with freinds would not always require driving. Although transportation also has its cons to car industry. A buisness plan has been made in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable.

In conclusion, countries have faced big problems due to all these causes of car usage. People had given up their cars and are now using transportaion, walking and Bycicles has helped get rid of all these problems countries were facing. People have decided to coaporate and help make a change has made an amazing progress. People from other countries have also been amazed seeing this change and mabey will also decided to apply this to their country for their safety. Now that cars have been reduced and transportation is provided in Germany, Paris, France, Bogota and the United States,pollution, traffic jams, space and transportation had all been solved.                        ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In Vauban, Germany there is a suburb that doesn't have any cars. People are allowed to own cars but there are only two places to park, which are the two large garages at the edge of the development. Also the owner must pay $40,000 for a space, along with a home. The majority of the residents do not own cars and say they are happier this way. This community is an example that is trending throughout Europe, and is trying to kick start a movement called ""smart planning"". ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States""(Rosenthal 5). The air is becoming very polluted and there are efforts being made to try and fix the issue.

In Paris, there was a day of near-record pollution. They decided to enforce a law banning certain cars on certain days to try and help clear the air. On Modays, people with even-numbered licence plates had to leave there cars at home or pay a fine of 22-euro or $31. About 4,000 people were fined that day. The congestion was down 60% in paris as well, and the smo cleared up enough monday for the French to decide on the banning of odd-numbered plates on Tuesday also.

Aslo in Bogota, Colombia there is a day without cars. There goal is to promotes alternative transportation and reduce the amount of smog. Anyone who violated this law was fined $25. "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said buisinessman  Carlos Arturo Plaza(selsky 24). This trend is spreading, with other Colombian cites joining the event.

The end of car culture is among us in the United States. Studies have shown that people are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licences as the years go by. The number of miles driven in the United states peaked in 2005 and is steadily dropping . As of April 2013, that number has dropped by about 9% and is equal to where the United states was in January 1995. The new generation are not finding drivin or even etting a licence a priorty anymore. They plan there work and social life by were they can walk or use a alternative  transportation. Bills are being made to help with the amount of pollution made by cars and are trying to gie the people more opportunities to use alternative transportations.

The amount of pollution created by cars are effecting our envoirnment. As shown in the example of paris, that by limiting the amount of cars o the road you can prevent some of the air pollution increasing the quaility of the air. Also not having to worry about driving has decreased stress in some cases. Overall limiting car usage would be beneficial to your wellbeing and the enviornment.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

The emissions from car tailpipes can cause environment issues and pollute the atmosphere with greenhouse gases. Some advantages from limiting car use include environmental improvements and recreational and personal advancement. Reducing car usage would be a benefit to most cities.

The atmosphere has been at an all time high in pollution, smog and green house gases are effecting cities. In Paris, France near-record pollution has been occuring and Paris decided to enforce a partial driving ban to help clear the air of the city. According to the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. Coldnights and warm days caused the warm layer of air to trap the car emissions into the atmosphere. In Bogota, Colombia there is a declared day without cars in the capital city of 7 million people. According to the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, the turnout was large and even the rain wouldn't stop them from participating. Carlos Plaza which was interviewed for the article stated ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Using less cars will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants according to Elisabeth Rosenthal author of ""The End of Car Culture"". Overall limiting car use will be a big factor in conserving resources and lowering emissions.

This limitation of cars would be beneficial to personal and recreational purposes also and not just the environment. In the town Vauban, Germany 70 percent of families do not own cars. According to the article ""Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, citizens claim to be happy this way. ""When I had a car I was always tense. ""I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter. In this new approach of limited car use, stores are placed just a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. This provides an easier way to get what you need in a fast and convenient manner. In Bogota, Colombia, parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city and sidewalks are being replaced, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. A network of public transportation could be created to save time and improve safety. Reducing car use creates an opportunity for more recreational buildings and stores to be created near your community for your benefit.

Reducing car use would be a huge environmental benefit, helping lower the amount of smog and carbon emissions. This would also create the opportunity for recreational and business improvements, which would help create new shopping districts and recreational buildings closer to your community. In general limiting car use would create a cleaner and safer environment but would still be able to provide you with new entertainment and a stronger local community.

It allows you to get a great excercise on your way to work, And everyone is wanting to participate in so many events that lead to Car-free day and many more.

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Columbia. Millions of Civilions were in on this exciting event that started in the 1990's. All Colombians either hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. The streets of Bogota was a traffic free place for a whole day! ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" Said Antanas Mockus, the mayor of Bogota. People are still riding there bikes and more to work because they feel like everyone should participate and don't think that alittle rain should stop it. But after, for the first time more colombian cities joined in on this day to start a new tradition. According to the Mayor, the day without cars has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any latin city. I think more countries should participate in this event, just because you are limiting yourself to how much you use your car and it seems like it would be alot of fun and is honestly such a great opportunity for you and everyone around you trying to make a diffrence.

""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses"". This is actually very surprising knowing that America is and has been one of the world's prime car cultures. ""They are not interested"", Said a mom of two children that are 19 and 21. She said, ""even though they both live in places where one could come in handy....but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take a public transportation or car-pool with friends."" To me I think these adults are making a statment. That you do not always have to have a car, and you most definatly do not have to have a licence to get you places. These teenagers are saving their money not having to worry about gas prices and car payments. Instead they are not wasting their money by walking and car-pooling to their jobs. It might take some time walking but you still get there.

In conclucion, I feel like getting to places with cars is fast, and I know most people agree with me...but why not just once in a couple of days just drop your keys and ride your bike or walk to work.

First of all not driving a car can make you less stressed out in life.""when I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way""(elisabeth roseenthal) by saying this she means that without a car to worry about it has made he less stressed out and much happier as a person.  ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress said businessman carlos arturo plaza""(andrew selsky) in this article this man says it a good chance to take away stess about worrying about a car, the bills for it, insurance on the car or anything else in that matter.

Second of all not driving a car can help to lower the air pollution around you.  according ro one acrticle they stopped driving an estimate of four thousand cars and has dramaticcaly lowered the amount of smog(greenhouse gas) in there towns air.  so if you stop driving cars it will help to lower the amount of smog in the air of your city or in the community around you.  ""The smog cleared enough monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"" in this article one city gave up driving lots of there cars for a while and doing so lowed the amount of smog in the air.

Third of all driving a car is really not needed for many things.  Why drive when you could just walk or ride a bike to where you are going there is really no point in you driving a car now and then.  Not driving but walking also opens more doors for buissness to be put in next to side walks or just in walking distance of your house.

CE7F4D4AA178,"Although the usage of motorized vehicles such as cars and motorcycles still remains at large, there is a significant amount of the global population that have realized the advantages of limited automobile usage. Cars and other diesel or gasoline dependant vehicles emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, which eventually lead to the progression of global warming. Not only this, but whether we notice it or not, cars and the spaces that are required to house cars take up valuable space that we can use for agriculture, the stimulation of the economy through the purchase of goods, even for progression of our education. The using of motorized vehicles is not something that should be banned by suburban life, but it, -like its predecessor the transportation means by horse hauling- has started to become obsolete.

As shown by Vauban, Germany, a community in which the usage of cars is virtually nonexistant, the extinction of car usage is something to be welcomed; like a weight being lifted off the responsible shoulders of your average driver. Driving is not only a what is now viewed as a necessary activity for daily living, but it is also a hazardous chore that we as common citizens must place on ourselves on a borderline daily basis. When driving, we are subjecting our safety to the hands of chance, leaving our lives suseptible to being taken from us by an irresponsible driver, someone who we will most likely never cross paths with again.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,""

says a member of the car-free community Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. Aside from health related deaths, death by car accident is not something that is unheard of, it is actually one of the top theives of life found in the United States alone. It is estimated that a death of a teenager (ages 16-20) resulting from a car accident happens every 16 seconds. Without cars to drive, there would be no way these accidents may occur.

Within the last century, the rate of global warming has skyrocketed in an almost terrifying way. The natural process that would normally take several millenia to take place without the interference made by humans has been nearly cut by three-quarters with the technological advancements that we as a species have made. In three of the four sources, it has shown that the emissions made by fossil fuel dependant vehicles have been the biggest contribution to the advancement of global warming. It is even shown in the article written by Robert Duffer that even a partial ban of car usage in Paris was able to reduce the amounts of smog there significantly.

In two of the articles, it has been shown that with the reduction of car usage, the space that was once consumed completely by these motorized psychological traps can be used to further flourish our enviornment with shopping malls, schools, parks and health centers that are readily available to us. Although we may not notice on a regular basis, but the amount of space that is used to give drivers a place to drive and to give cars a place to inhabit is more than likely bigger than the amount of space that we give an average citizen to live in. In Vauban, Germany 5,500 residents are able to live within a rectangular square mile, whereas a majority of that space in a place like Miami, Florida would be made vacant in terms of living, but prosperous in terms of space taken up by cars. In Bagota, Columbia as a result from their yearly ""Car-free day"" has increased their amount of publicly availabel park and sports center, and have also improved the sidewalks that are readily available to its citizens.

Physical activity has always been promoted, since we were small children who are incapable of driving. Some would say that we were conditioned to view exercise as the best alternative to driving, and it turns out that our conditioning has been proven as fruitful. Within the last several years, the amount of miles driven per person has decreased by nine percent as shown in the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the amount of those looking to receive their driver's liscense has also decreased. This is not because the generation of millenials has viewed driving as something not to their interest, but because we are conditioned to not want to partake in it. Even if our conditioning was not intentional, it has proven fruitful in terms of the improvement of our awareness of both human lives and the enviornment. Both cars and driving are making their way to ineffeciency, and that is not a bad thing. The lack of cars on the road is something to look forward to, both for our ability to look forward to new technological advancements in transportation and for our longevity as a species.

They might say i'm crazy for not wanting people to drive car's but in actuality i'm just trying to help and make the world a better place for the kids of the next generation. In a article i read ""paris bans driving due to smog"" ""by robert duffer"" He tells all about how car's were making so much smog that on monday paris enforced a partial ban to clear there air of the global city. That everyone had to leave there car at home or get a ticket of 31 dollars. Almost 4000 drivers were fined and twenty seven had there car impounded.

Even in other places like germay it's ether a car or house. Everyone would take the house thats somewhere to lay your head every night were your kids make memories that you will forever cherish. Car's there isnt know really point to them but just to drive and get somehwere. You can take a bike or even walk while at the same time helping the world and helping your self. I'm not saying stop using car's there so bad you will die if you use a car no. I'm just saying use your car when you really need to.

If something is close by you just have a nice walk and enjoy the air the beauty of being outside. If your going somewhere far? take a bus it might cost a dollar or two but just think about it. You dont have to drive your not using your car and your saving the world little by liite. Even encourage your friend's and family memeber's to do what your doing. maybe by 2040 we would have a whole new world.

We would be feeling better, breathing better. There is a endless possibilites to how better we could be. Have you ever thought about being a supr hero? or helping people? for one you can stop using your car so much. Then you would be everyone super hero, even mine.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D30A337CB040,"Around the world we are seeing drastic drops of limiting car usage. In VAUBAN, Germany cars, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in this new district. In Paris after days of near-record pollution, Paris decided to ban driving to clear the air of the global city. In BOGOTA, Colombia it has been the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis. The United States of America has even passed their peak of driving in 2005 and dropped steadily since.

Giving up your car may seem very hard to you, but for the people in VAUBAN, Germany seem to like it much better. In fact street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in this experimental new district. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys space, for $40,000, along with a home. Nearly 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars they seem to be much happier this way.

After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air. On monday people with even-numbered liscence plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a fine of 22-euro. The same would apply for odd-numbered plates the next day. Nearly 4000 drivers were fined and 27 drivers cars were impounded for their reaction to the fine.

In BOGOTA, Colombia they were in a program to spread to oher countries. They were on their third straight year that cars have been banned. Although buses and taxis were permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violaters faced a $25 fine.

C2DC01231DBB,"Limit Of Car Usage

When you think about limiting car usage you might think ""Well how am I supposed to get there. Theres no way i'm able to get to my destination without a car."" Yes, I'm pretty sure we all would'nt want to walk five thousand miles to visit a friend three hours away, but here me out. Doesnt a car make you all tired? Knowing you have to pay a bill every month, or getting gas four times a week. Just imagine a world where thats not a problem.

In Vauban Germany they are most of the time a car free zone. Owners of cars aren't allowed to have cars in there garage or in the streets or wherever a car would normally be. They have to keep there cars in a space they buy at the edge of the community for $40,000 plus the paying for their homes. Now I wouldnt want to pay all this money to park my car. Most people in suburban homes sold their vehicles so that they could live there without a problem. Heidren Walter said,"" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" She says as she's walking down the street she can actual listen to the communtity of children playing and not be drown out from the loud motor in the car.

Now, limiting car usage doesnt mean we all have to walk to our destinations. We could start using bicycles more often and actually get a benifit of working out. Sure it might make you all sweaty and gross. But make a plan to get up a little earlier and then wash up at wherever it is you are to be. And limiting cars doesnt mean every single one of us need to give up our cars. Instead we can find a friend who lives near to us or a fellow co-worker and car pool. Instead of all two hundred employes lugging their cars on the road and getting stuck in torturous traffic. make a plan to get five people in a car and instead of two hundred cars on their way to work, there would only be about fourty cars going to the same place. That would clear up our roads and ruduce traffic. In France Congestion was down sixty percent after reducing cars.

""Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Westurn Europe.."" ,according to Robert Duffer. People today are now worrying to much on their cars and how much it will cost them. Not worrying about jobs and insurance. The invention of the car was not to see who can get the most miles or whos car gets better horse power. It was about helping people get from A to B, and we can do just that.

There are many people out here who will think that limiting car use is a waste of time and like to keep things the same. But we can be the generation who changes that. If we could go down to one car a family and start car pooling with one another, or even start using bikes to go to places with our friends, we can help make the community a better place. One day just try. Try walking to the super market. Instead of making your mom drive you and your friends to the mall, try making a plan to all ride your bikes there. It doesnt hurt to try, so try to start.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In Paris they have such a high population which is near record they enforced a partial driving ban to let the air clear up.

Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota and were enthusiastic to see the event. This campign began in Bogota in the mid 1990s. Which has lead to the developement of 118 miles of bike paths in Bogota. Also parks and sports centers bloomed throughout the city and new upscale shopping districts as well.

Finally in the US president Obama had goals to curb the US` greenhouse gas emissions were unveild. Recent studies in America show that fewer Americans are buying cars and get fewer licenses as each year goes by. The US having broad expanses and suburban ideals had long been on of the world`s prime car cultures. It`s the birth place of the first ever model T in Detroit. The rate of car ownerships per household and per person slowly began to decrease withing 3 years. If the patteren persists and many beleve it will it will have benificial implications for the US` carbon emissions and the environment. transportation is the 2nd largest source behind power plants. It would have a negative implication for the car industry. ther has been a large drop in percentage of 16-39 years old getting their licenses.

These are some reasons why people should limit their car usage so we can keep the positive trend in the car for our enviroment and make breathing healthier to people and lower our pollution. So keep it up and our enviroment will start to recover from the years of pollution we have caused.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E90AE9030DCA,"They really should ban cars in big cities. The only thing they shouldn't ban is, buses and taxies .

This willstop alot of air pollution and stress. (

Carlos Arturo Plaza)

Well lets get it started. The car usage should be limited only in big cities. The reason I said this because, most Vaubans streets are ""car-free"". Big cities limited there cars to be on the streets. There really no places to park unless you pay for a spaces with you house in that's 40,000 dollars itself or you have to go to a huge gargage. Most vaubans familys do not own cars. They sold there cars to move there. The way you have to get around is by foot or bicycles. Well I think that cars should be limited in big cities. I said this because less money coming out your pocket in less wrecks happing if you ban cars from the street.

Something else I said why cars should be limited from the streets is because, there are stree and air pollution. They way this is happing is by gas leaks, oil , and more. The reason I said this is because, banning cras from the streets will have less stress and air pollution. The way this is happing because gas leaks , oil, and others. All the leaks, bad drivers are getting into people head. If you know it or not less car usage will clear up everything. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. This means that the population wasnt bad and the stress and air pollution was not high.

The more car usage on the streets will have you stress out and the air pollution will be bad. If all this was taken away you reallywouldn't have to worry about anything unless there cars on the streets.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
8ED40B2AD9BA,"What if cars were never invented? What if cars were so much money no one will be able to buy them? Limiting the usage of cars can help the economy and help the environment in many ways. Places like Germany, Paris, and Bogota have banned the usage of cars. They say that since they have did that congestion in the cities have gone down. Polluted cities aren't as crowded as they use to since they have banned the usage of cars.

Vauban, Germany is one of the places that has banned the usage of cars. You can still own a car but there are only two places to park your car, large garages at the end of a development or buy a psace along with a home. In article one it stated that,  ""More than 70 percent of Vauban's familis do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move here,"" People siad that having a car was tense and kind of too much pressure when in a crowded city. In 2006 Vauban had become an example of  a growing trend in Europe. Vauban home to 5,500 residents within a square mile, they have been the most advanced experiment in low car usage. Stores are placed on the walk away or on a main street, rather than in malls or on a distant highway.

Paris have a near-record pollution so they enfroced a partial drivning ban the clear some of the air in the global city. Motorists with even and odd-numbered license plates were ordered to leave thier cars at home or they suffer and fine of 22-euros. Around 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty-sevn people had thier cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. Congestion was down nearly 60 percent in the capital of France after five days after the enforement of the driving fine. SInce Paris has generally more smog than other European capitals diesel fueal was blamed for it. Diesel fuel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. Delivery companies complained about the lost of revenue for cars. In aritcle two it siad, ""Public transportation was free of charge from Friday to Monday,"" the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to recind the ban for odd-numbered car plates on Tuesday.

Bogota, Columbia have banned usage of cars for three years straight. Cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day. Thier goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Anybody that violated that suffered a fine of $25 dollars. Aritcle 3 buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It;s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" meaning that cutting down car usage with lower the greenhouse gases in the air and clear it up. Dyas without cars is a part of a improvement capaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s, it has been the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Parks and sport centers and have bulid throughout the city. Pitted sidewalks have been replaced with smooth sidewalks, rush-hour restirctions have cut traffic dramatically, new resturants and upscale shopping ditstricts have cropped up. Bannig cars in Bogota has been the best thing that has ever happened to the city.

In 2013, President Obama had ambitious goals to curb the United States's greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies have shown that many Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years go by. In article 4 it said that ""as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995,"" part of that is because many Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. Demographic shifts in the driving population have made the trend of banning car accelerate.

In conclusion, banning cars will a successful rate on not just the United States but the world. Maybe people should actually look and promote the idea to see if it will help our economy and or environment. Without cars polluted cities will be able to breath fresh air and won't have to worry about payign for gas. Banning cars could be the best thing that will happen to the world.                          ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
BE1F20C5B099,"The advantages of limiting car usage is that it helps the envirornment to stay healthy, it helps bring the rate of high car usage down and lets people take bikes, skates, and ect. and so people can be more actice, and cars have harmful chemicals, and gases that is bad for the air we breath.

The advantages for limiting car usage is that it helps the envirornment to stay healthy because with so many countries with over populated cities have alot of cars which causes smog. Like in Vauban Germany they have gave up on there cars so they have baned cars, and that most of the population has got rid of their car, and or sold them to stay in Vauban which has a population of 5,500 residents. The people now in Vuaban walk of side walks, and are more actice most of the citizens like it that way. which that is a good way to get over car is to use bikes, skateboards, and ect. So that people can be more active, and social. It is also good that they do that so they can get a exercise than just sitting in a car, and driving to a location.

the advantages of limiting car usage is that it help prevents harmful chemicals and gases thar are bad for the air we breath because if we keep polluting the streets with cars those harmful and deadly chemicals, and gases go to the atmosphere and come back to us as air we breath, and those are not good things to put in your body. The cause of over populated cities like in paris, or bogota have cause alot of smog. So now what they have to lower the smog is that they have days when they dont drive cars, and that if you rode a car you would get fined. In Colombia Bogota they have time where that the people didnt mind not driving cars, and they would hike, bike or even take the bus.

To end off the advantages of limiting car usage is that it helps the envirorment to stay healthy, help bring people together and make them more active by taking bikes, skates, and ect. and also cars have harmful chemicals, and gases that is bad for the air we breath.

86235E0EB8C7,"In many places around the world people own cars and drive around almost every day. But what many people dont know is that cars can release harmful gases that can hurt the earth's environments. Three reasons why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it prevents traffic, it helps the environment and your community, and we dont really need cars to live our everyday lives.

Limiting car usage in your community is good beacuse it prevents traffic. Everyday, people use their cars to go places even if the place their going to is down the street and that causes traffic some times. For example, in Paris there has been days of near-record pollutions due to traffic so Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from pollution. They said every Monday motorist with even-numbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at home or face a 22 euro fine. This ban helped because congestion dropped 60 percent in the capital of France just after five days of the ban was set.

Another reason why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it helps prevent pollution to the air around you. Cars can release gasses that can harm the earths environment and the community around you. Which is why in the United States the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities much like the one in Vauban, Germany. These ""car Free"" communities consist of a small town where the usage of cars is illegal, you are not even allowed to own homes with a garge in it. This is very good for the environment and can prevent air pollution.

We should limit how often we use cars because we dont really need them to get around and many countries beleive so too. For example in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that was set to spread out to other countries, during this program millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. One reason why these people might have done this is because any one who violated this rule would have been fined $25 but the main goal for this was to prevent smog in their countries environment. The turn out however was huge! Even when there was rain it didn't stop them. The mayor of Bogota said ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" and now for the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event.

There are many reasons why we should limit the usage of cars in our communities because it prevents traffic , helps the environment and because we dont really need to use cars so often , take Colombia for example. So lets take action and follow the steps that many countires and communities are taking to help our communities.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A51FCD8809EA,"Nowadays, with gas prices skyrocketing, along with prices of new cars, it is logical for any person to invest their time in the use of public transportation or carpooling. As you can see in this passage, many countries have already begun to take a stand to protect our planet by limiting car usage to reduce the amount of gas emissions. America as a country needs to find a way to get involved as well.

In Vauban, a city in Germany almost all homeowners have given up their cars and turned to bicycling and walking to get where they need to go. Paris upholds a fine where people who have even-numbered license plates are allowed to drive on Monday's and odd-numbered plates on the next day. If a motorist did not abide by this rule they were forced to pay a $31 fine. Also, in Bogota, Colombia, the nations capital participate in an annual ""Day Without Cars"". Only buses and taxis were permitted and violaters faced $25 fines.

In America, transportation is the second largest source of gas emission, us as a country to take a stand to change that and protect our planet. With the rise in new technologies of things like cellphones and smartphones, cellphones now have car-pooling apps where it's as easy as clicking abutton to find a ride to work without driving your own car. It's also beneficial to you because you don't have to spend your money on gas, tolls and other fees. It's very simple to catch a ride on a bus or train as well, its cost efficient and good for the enviroment. Getting rid of your car altogether is beneficial in more ways than one. You don't have to worry about the cost to maintain your cost for things like repairs and insurance. And of course, you dont have to spend as much as $200 a month on gas.

Countries around the world have begun to use their resources to limit the amount of car usage. In just simple ways like carpooling or taking a bus or a train, each person can help in making a change to our world to save our atmosphere from pollution.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

As stated in the article 'Car-Free Cities' Source 1: Heidrum Walter, a media trainer and mother two quotes ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much more happier this way"" Heidrum being a mother two you can only imagine the car trips she would have to make. Going place to place can cause a lot of stress to some people and it makes it harder for them to drive. For example, someone could be stressed to the max with all the traffic and driving around that it could create accidents along the way. No one should ever feel stressed while driving. Driving should be a privellege and good one.

In Paris they have banned driving due to smog. Diesel fuel was balmed since France has tax ploicy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. Paris has more smog than other European capitals. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. Certain things like this can help save the environment without the usage of vehicles.

With no car usage it prevents teens from getting into accidents and or drunk driving. The safer way to go is to walk or stay with a friend somewhere safe than being on the road. Many accidents could be prevented but it wont if limiting the car usage is not available. Death rates will decrease and many people will be safer this way. A study last year found that drving by young people decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Without transportation many young people could make other main priorities. For example, they could organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

Up above I have given my reasons why we should all limit car usage. It would relieve stress from on the road, saves the environment and takes the smog away, and young people would be more socialize and up for doing more than what they already do like jobs.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

imagine one day, of limiting the use of cars. It is true that people couldn't reach their destination as quick as they want to; however, there are beneficial advantages for limiting car usage. Such as, citizens having a much better time, less smog interrupting the oxygen, and the community might be better without vehicle culture.

INITIALLY

, one of the auspicious advantages of limiting car usage is citizens having a much better time. To illustrate my point, in Bogota, Columbia, they've launched a campaign in the mid-1990's called the Car-free day. Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during work, leaving the streets of the capital city to ellude the traffic jams. Also in result of the Car-free day campaign, parks and sport centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

IN ADDITION

, less smog interrupting the oxygen is another benefit to limiting car usage. To explain my reasoning, Paris has banned the privelage of driving due to smog. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals. Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel  engines in the rest of western europe, according to Retuters.

FURTHERMORE

, the community might be better without vehicle culture. To explain, President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the united states' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will gety a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

ALL IN ALL

, there can be auspicious advantages to limiting car usage because of citizens having a much better time, less smog interrupting the oxygen, and the community might be better without vehicle culture. Some people may say that cars get you to your destination faster; however, it may be all for the better.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
AF7E7CE5C522,"Limiting care usage may be quite a inconvenience, but it can be a really great advantage in the long run. Plus there are better alternatives to automobiles that work just as well such as trains, buses, taxis, and even bicycles. Not only are they better for the environment, but they can be used to live a happier lifestyle. Overall it leads up to happy citizens, and cleaner air. In fact cleaner air is so desired and necessary that some countries, including the U.S., are now turning it into law.

Over in Vauban, Germany, most residents do not own cars, and alternatively ride their bicycles wherever they may need to go. The way that they made this possible was making sure that there were only two places to park - large garages at the end of the development. Even more efficiently added to this inconvenience to car users, a car space would cost forty-thousand dollars along with a home, and as a result, only 30% of Vauban's residents own cars, and 57% of people sold their car to move to Vauban. Some places are even going as far as having a car-free day, such as in Bogota, Columbia. On this day it is not permitted by law to drive a personal automobile vehicle.

Which brings me to the subject that many countries are now putting the practice of fining people for driving into law, rather than a one day event. Over in Paris, with a near-record pollutuion rate, people are fined for using cars by license plates, meaning on Monday a motorist with an even-numbered license plate would be fined 22 euro, whereas on the following day this would apply to odd-numbered license plates. There were exceptions to this however for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This impacted delivery companies, and caused them to complain due to the fact that this caused them to lose revenue, but according to the article (in my understanding), nothing was done about it.                    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D2A0B9B93DC3,"Changing our ways on how we use cars for the better? Is it just so happen that people are using there car less than usual? In many places like Germany, Paris, Bogota are changing the ways to use cars. To reduce every little problem cars are causing. Traffic jams, smogs, and reducing greenhouse gas emmisions, people are getting smart about using there cars everyday. Maybe people are tired of using all cars of the time.

When people buy car, it gives them alot of freedom knowing they area able to go where ever they're heart desires. Lately people aren't feeling the whole waiting in traffic if theres an accident or just to much cars. Bus rides, trains, taxi are helping reduce this. People can go somewhere without waiting that long just for a little price. In Germany there are new laws where they put a prices to put cars and there is only certian places you can put there cars at. 70% of families in Germany have do not own cars and 57% sold there cars because of this new law? You  would think thats people would complain about having cars and having no place to put them. But many people are accuatly happy that they put this new type of law. Many people prefered to have this happen.

Smogs? what are smogs? smogs are grey clouds that hurt is in ways we dont even know. Cars emmit these deadly gases and we dont know it. Cars arent the only one who emmit they clouds of grey smoke, factories emmit this also. Which is not helping our ecosystem at all. In Paris they had an order to help redude this problem. On mondays motorists with even-numbered liscense plates were ordered to leave their cars at home which on the following day people with odd numbered liscenes plates were doing the same thing if they did not follow this ruling they were have to suffer a thirty one dollar fine. This helped alot with the smog.

Places like Germany and Paris arent the only one who are changing the ways. In Bogota they have a car free day which only allows you to take a bicycle, taxi, buses or whatever you want but do not take a car or suffer the rath of fine. Going on for three years now people are saying they enjoy these types of days because everything is more relaxing it reduces stress and air pressure which is a really good thing. Even when it rains it doesn't stop people from participating from this. There is even a 118 mile bicycle path that shows how much people want to change the way they use cars. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, snooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

Many sciencetists are believing that the car culture is coming to an end. Cars sales have drop alot. People are taking the bus, taxis, and even trains to avoid traffic. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Younges ages don't even drive till the age of 21 or they don't even care till then. They can usually care poll to places like partys, mall and the beach. They don't need a seperate car for each person when they are all going to the same place. Which is feel its a good and bad things. Its good because poeple are caring more that were causing harm to our own home and that they know that they can do all they want together and still have fun. It causes harm to busineses many stores could go out of business.

It does not matter if we try to stop using cars or not we are always hurting in some other way. Traffic jams, smogs and reducing greenhouse emmisions are just the begining of this all. We can do way more if we put out mind set to it.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
4C39B5DDA569,"There are many advantages when you limit your car usage. By limiting your car usage you will have to choose a diffrent way of transportation and thats often walking or riding a bike. Those two choices of transportation are often used as stress relivers. Also you dont have to worry about traffic or having to rush out of work for the gym beacause you have all ready got in a little excrise

For exapmle in source 3 ""car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota"" it says "" It's a good opporunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"". Also when limiting your car usage people often turn to walking, or biking as i've stated before. when a city has a high populltion of walkers and bikers they will have to start making public places closer. As stated in ""source 1"" (¶ 6) "" In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.""When walking you can get a really nice excrise in when getting from place to place and riding a bike can also get your legs in shape. While siting in a car all day dosent help you out at all it's only polluting the air and has you on your butt all day. Less car driving can also mean less car wrecks.

Often people are late to work because of rush hour. As stated in ""source 2"" (¶14)""Congestion was down 60 precent in the capital of france"". while riding a bike you dont really have to think about traffic. Another problem with driving is parking the less cars the less you'll have to worry about a parking space.        ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
1DF732ED4D1A,"We currently live in a world dependent on machines; becoming more and more enveloped in this idea of reliance. However, now we have reached a point where that reliance is harming us and our planet, and it will continue to do so if we don't adjust our lifestyles. Seeing as that we've recently reached that point of realization, we are starting to limit ourselves to the things that do harm our planet, including limiting the usage of cars. Living in the twentieth century almost inevitably means relying on cars for transportation. Although it may seem impossible to convince so many to pursue this act of limiting the usage of cars, it is surely not impossible, as we've seen from the recent efforts made around the world. It will take time to adjust to the drastic change, but the benefits are worth the while. A few of the many advantages include, the conservation of our valuable space, improving the quality of our environment, and allowing for the opportunity of new ideas, developments, and change.

The first of the advantages may not be the first you would think of, yet it is certainly an important one. By limiting our use of cars it would save and replenish our amount of space that we currently have available. It's not only the cars themselves that take up space, but it is also the space left for street parking in the big cities, the massive parking garages used at shopping malls, and the driveways and garages at the houses in large suburban neighborhoods. This method of limiting the use of cars as been successfully applied to a town in Germany, known as Vauban. In Vauban, '' [r]esidents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars '' ( '' In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'' ). The town of Vauban, has given up their areas of street parking, driveways, and home garages to limit--almost entirely--their use of cars. With the removal of all traces of automobile usage, some may be concerned about how they are expected to reach their desired destinations, but in Vauban and many other places preparing the follow this plan, stores will be placed '' a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway '' ('' In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'' ). Although some may be concerned with the potential limit on their car usage, they must be reminded that the space originally used for cars will certainly not go to waste, and will be used for bigger and better purposes that will not harm our planet.

This second advantage is the one most associated with the limit put on our use of cars--the improved quality of the environment. The environment can be improved with the decrease of greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn improves the quality of the air that surrounds us. Our President, Barack Obama, has '' ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions '' ( '' The End of Car Culture '' ), but that can only be done with the cooperation of the citizens. Fortunately, that cooperation has been seen with the '' fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior '', in which '' recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by '' ( '' The End of Car Culture '' ). It is understood by professionals, that if the pattern continues, '' it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions '' ( '' The End of Car Culture '' ). Although some may be reluctant to pursue the path of limiting their use of cars, they should be well informed that by doing so, they are improvong their overall state of living by not producing these harmful properties that are being released into the air that we breathe.

This last advantage is most likely the most considerably accepted by the public, because of its simplicity on their part and the benefits they recieve from it. With the limit put on the use of cars, that allows for the opportunity of new ideas, developments, and change. The idea of limiting the use of cars has gone global, from Germany to Colombia to France, this idea is quickly becoming one widely accepted by the public and their officials. The idea of a car-free dat has sprouted from Colombia, in which the citizens of Colombia are encouraged tohike, bike, skate, or take the bus to work rather than using cars for transportation ( '' Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota '' ). The public has responded positively to these recent changes, saying, '' ' It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution ' '', which was spoken by '' Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife '' ( '' Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota '' ). Not only have new opportunities for the public been introduced, but so have new developments. The new developmets include '' [p]arks and sports centers...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks...and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts '' ( '' Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota '' ). The citizens of various cities can also expect to see plans in which '' ' pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected networl to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety ' '' ( '' The End of Car Culture '' ).

There have been many advantages associated with a limit put on the use of cars, including the conservation of our valuable space, the lowering of the greenhouse gas emissions, and the opportunity for new ideas, developments, and change. All of these advantages can be fulfilled to their entire purposes, but it is a group effort as a planet. We can continue to live in the luxury of these advantages, as long as we do our part to limit our use of cars.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
53E7FE4748E2,"Throughout the years of my life I noticed something about my family that didn't really bother me as much as it does now. My family seemed to have a dependance on motor vehicles. Everywhere we went we drove there, whether its down the street or around the corner, a car must be used. As of now I can see the affects of those actions, like global warming, pollution, and the hole in the ozone layer , as well as huge amounts of stress. All of those should be a good enough reason to limit car usage.

By reducing car usage you can reduce the harmful affects too much usage can bring to the world. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, Duffer discusses how in Paris the smog was so overwhelming that they actually had to threaten citizens with fines to make them keep their cars at home. Now i know some people were against the ""keeping your car or you will suffer a 22-euro fine""(Duffer 11), but im sure they will understand when they aren't walking around paris with medical mask over their mouths.

Responsibilty comes along with owning car, from keeping the gas meter from going below ""E""  to changing the oil and tires. All of those responsibilities can bring an abundance of stress on anyone. So reducing car usage would reduce the amount of stress on a car owner. As explained in the article ""In German Suburb, Life goes on without cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, A community in Vauban, Germany has gone on without the use of cars. The amount of stress on the citizens must be extremely low due to the fact they don't have to the deal with the responsibility of taking care of a car. Heidrun Walter, one of the citizens there stated ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,""(Rosenthal 3). Less car usage in the end will reduce the amount of stress placed upon someone.

The reduction of car usage is gonna benefit the car owner in the end and everyone else because it will help our environment and also reduce unhealthy stress. So instead of driving everywhere try to ride the bike, carpool, or even ride the city bus. Pursuing these actions will benefit you as well as your community.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
C987753AC378,"Gas prices. Car notes. Parking fines. These are all expensive things you have to pay for when you consider owning a car. Most family get rid of their cars because of having to pay these high prices in order to keep their cars.

There are a couple of car free cities;for example German Suburbs is car free because of expensive fees they would have to pay just to have a space to park in,.""but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development,where a car-owner buys a space,for $40,000,along with a home.""These families would have to spend $40,000 along just to park their car in a large garage,it makes it easy for them to make the decision not to own a car because prices are so high. Having to buy a parking space for that much and still having to buy a home along with the $40,000 can cause a lot of stress on family providers because they have to basically spend all their money on one high priced item;a CAR!

You can become much happier without a car knowing that you don't have to spend all your money on this one item that could break down on you at anything,""As a result,70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."". For example, this mother of two is much happier without owning a car,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""The mother of two became much happier because she no longer had to pay these high fines,fees,gas prices,and car notes that others had to pay for. It was other was to get around that you didn't have to bother coming out of pocket for such as,""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday. This was a big help to limiting car usage.

Studies show that the percentage of driving has dropped tremendously from 2005 to 2013. Most of the reason for the driving percentage dropping was gas prices;It began to get to high,President Obama tried to do something about it as much as he could.""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions,unveiled.""Fewer cars were seen on the roads driving,""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars,driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""It caused people to not drive their cars and take public transortation or not go anywhere at all. It got to the point where""cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars.""

Some of the advantages to limiting car usage are just what us as Americans want/need to hear because its really expensive. It's not just about buying a car and running it off of air;your car takes gas,car notes,needs servicing every once in a while it's not easy owning a car. Studies show how much the driving percentaged dropped keeps dropping because of high expensive prices that we have to pay to own a car.         ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
0542651C8269,"A major form of transportation that has been around for a long time is driving in cars.

Now, people are relying less on cars and are finding different methods of commuting. Some countries are even banning cars. Limiting car usage will have many advantages, such as reducing stress and benefitting the enviroment.

Cars come with a large amount of responsibility, which causes people to have stress.

Many people are actually happier without cars. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two, stated that ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" (Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal) People can be tense from having a car because they have to do things like pay for insurance, pay the monthly bill for the actual car, pay for gas, and worry about where to park. Living a life without a car means that you are saving money and you are walking and biking more. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city."" (Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky) Due to the lowering in the number of cars, people are being able to go outside more into new parks, go workout with friends, or just enjoy the outdoors. All of this is healthy and good for a person, and causes a person to relax and feel less stressed.  Due to no cars on the road in Car-free day, there is no such thing as rush hour traffic, so people do not have to worry about leaving early or standing in traffic for a long period of time. Many who drive cars tend to have road rage, causing them to shout or get mad, which is not good for their health. People that drive to work on their bikes or use public transportation will not experience road rage, which will cause them to be happier. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. (Source 3: ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky) Car-free day allowed this man to go to work in a fun way with his wife, enjoying the outdoors while also spending time together. If he had taken a car to work, he might have not went with his wife and had a good time. Limiting car usage will lead to less stress and happier people in the long run.

A big reason for the great amount of pollution in the world today is from cars.

Reducing the number of cars will also lead to a better enviroment with cleaner air. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal) Pollution is a major problem in many counties, such as the United States, and limiting the amount of cars on the road will surely have a positive impact on the enviroment. It will not do any harm. ""If the pattern persists- and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behing power plants."" (Source 4: The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal) Since transportation is one of the major reasons for the amount of pollution in America, imagine the benefit to the enviroment that will occur if the amount of driving and car usage becomes limited. This is a very ambitious goal to curb America's greenhouse gas emissions. It is proven that fuel in cars is blamed for polluting counties. For example, Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, and is also blamed for polluting the country. (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer) Smog is caused by the pollution, and is the key factor to the reason why Paris is banning driving. The only place the ban of cars will negatively effect is the car industry. People use their car sometimes for uneccessary situtations, such as driving to a friends house if they live a short distance away. ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" (Source 4: The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal) It is not always needed to drive somewhere to meet up with someone. Technology nowadays, such as cellphones and computers, allow us to call, text, or video chat with people who are far away. This saves time and gas, and will be better for the enviroment.

Cars are not always necessary for commuting, and they also cause stress. They are harming our enviroment by polliuting it with its carbon emissions. There are other ways of transportation, such as public transportation, walking, or riding your bike. Limiting the amount of car usage will lead to people being healthier and less stressed, as well as the air being cleaner.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
AC9C58B3F586,"Cars may seem like a great new way to get around but have you ever actually done your research on a car and what they do to the world? You may want to do some reasearch on how cars are actaully not good of an idea to use on a daily basis. There are a lot of citys and towns that want to stop the daily use of cars. Cars may seem like a good idea and like some  people say ""yay I dont have to walk anymore"" but if you really knew what cars do then you wouldnt really like them anymore.

Cars produce so much pollution in the air, its sickening to know how much they reqally produce. Can you imagine how polluted new york city may be because of so many cars, busses, etc? I think thats why a lot of states are doing the train system, to stop so much pollution and to reduce the amount of cars we use. Like florida for example are starting the ""sunrail"" which is a train system that will take you all the way around town. Also look at this, so many ""smart"" cars are coming soon and electric cars where you charge your car and then you can just go drive and not get gas. They are actually making charging stations for electeric cars now.

If you start to limit your car use and start using a bus, train, etc you are also saving so much money on gas. like the amount of money you save on gas you can be buying yourself those shoes you wanted or that game youve been wanting to bad. The world is filled with so much pollution and nasty chemicals in the air and some of that is because of your car.. trucks also have so much pollution that its just sickening. Wouldnt it be great if your kids and your grandkids wont have to use a car and they will actaully probably live longer because there isnt as many chemicals in the skies. We may be living longer then the people back then but they didnt have cars so they didnt have any issues with pollution.

Car accidents, thats the most dreaded word ever. I dont think anyone wants to get a phone call saying someone you love or care about has been in a car accident. Thats the worst possible thing. You rarely see accidents with trains, or busses. I think its such a great idea to lower our use of cars and start using other ways to get arond. Most of us have 2 legs we should actually use them sometime and not be lazy and always want to drive places. People back then didnt have that option they either walked or didnt go anywhere at all.

B3E0A5CCECDA,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage helps to cleanse the environment, saves citizens' money, and can help with improving citizens' health.

One advantage to limiting car usage is that it will cleanse the environment. Cars give off a number of gallons of gas each time they're used. These toxic chemicals found in gases pollute the air. Imagine breathing in all of that waste! Studies have actually found evidence that the toxins from car fuel are very harmful to the health of animals, plants, and humans. It can cause breathing difficulties associated with problems in the lungs when inhaled too heavily; as well as it dirties plants and makes it more difficult for them to grow healthy, like they should, and it can even poison and kill the animals. Who wants to take a risk so deadly?

Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it will save citizens' money. Cars aren't cheap. Depending on the make and model of the car, they can cost anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000. Insurance and keeping up with the maintenance of a car also costs a lot. Car owners should be expecting to pay $100-$500 a month for car maintence, and if insurance is required, depending on the state that the car owner lives in, than another additional $100. Finally, is the price for gas. The price for gas in this day in age economy ranges from $3.00-$6.00 per gallon! If a car owner has a long way to drive, but doesn't have a lot of money, he/she may want to consider taking a bus or carpooling with someone to help them out.

A rather more humorous advantage to limiting car usage, is that it could help give citizens a work out. Instead of driving where they need to go, people could walk to their desired destination and burn a ton of calories while doing it! Or in contrast to waiting for a friend to pick them up outside their houses, they could walk to a bus stop and wait for the bus to take them wherever they need to go. This also relates to saving money and helping cleanse the environment. Citizens' will pay less for a gym membership now that they're getting a work out. They'll also be helping the environment by not burning all of those fuel wastes just to get to where they need to go. It's a win-win for everyone!

Of course, there are many advantages to limiting car usage for our citizens, their wallets, and the environment. These three are just a few of the plentiful, conservative ways out there; however, they're all extroardinarily efficient.                          ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
6FD9A4641AD7,"There are many different things that you could do to help out the ecosystem, and reducing your car use is certainly one of them. A study conducted in Europe shows that 12% of greenhouse gas emissions are the result of passanger car over-use. But of course as humans we are bound to resist and not give up things that make our lives easier. Yet there are many alternatives to not driving a car, for example car pool, have family members pick you up, buses, trains, taxis, bikes, etc. As you can see is not a matter of lack of alternatives but a lack of interest in helping out nature and everything that it helps support.

A very important way in which car usage affects our lives is pollution, many places around the world are trying to impose taxes and fines in order to keep people from over-relying on their cars. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"", things like this are quite obviously why the ecosystem is not at it's worst yet. One of the most polluted cities in the world Beijing competition for Paris until law enforcers stepped in to resolve the issue. Another city fighting pollution caused by car use is Bogota, who has once again banned it's over 7.2 million population from using their cars on the ""Day Without Cars"" event. The Day Without Cars is an event that if not followed could be penalize citizens most likely monetary fines of around $25 dollars, although some were even arrested for not complying with this method. Described by Andrew Selsky as a ""program set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during this car free day"". Not only is this helping out the rest of the world is bringing people closer as more people go to parks, sport centers and spend time together.

With more bans and restrictions on car usage of course the car usage is destined to decrease but although it might sound terrible it could actually lead to healthier lives. With less cars on the road the air you are breathing will be more pure and healthy and less polluted. More people will have to walk which will decrease heart problems, obesity and other diseases all over the world. If people don't buy cars then companies like Ford, Toyota, Honda and more will make less money and some might run out of business but that will not happen since most people are not ready to make a commitment such as giving up your car. But if cars are not being purchased then they will stop being produced which can lead to a better economy since the government won't be spending billions on gas, diesel and such. Apparently the amount of miles driven by a person yearly has decreased over the last couple of years which has led sociologists to believe that if this pattern persists it will have many beneficial implications for the environment, even though it could have negative implications for car industries as i stated before.

Car usage will decrease since people are driving less and less every year and young people are buying less cars according to a study in 2013 that found that ""driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009"". Even though many experts can't be sure yet, the drop in sales and decrease in usage has led many to believe that the U.S. has already peaked in miles driven and possibly car sales. There is no accurate way of predicting whether this will bring completely positive or completely negative consequences. President Obama's ambitious goals to change the greenhouse gas emissions has proven to shift or change the way people act as recent studies show that ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"".                                            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

If people start to limit the usuage of cars this planet might actually become a safer more joyful place to live.

In the past years greenhouse gasses have skyrocketed. The ozone layer is now trapping car exhaust fumes in earth and leading to what some might call global warming. Summer becomes hotter and longer, vice versa with winter. The U.S alone is  to blame for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emission. In europe it's 12 percent which is still quite a grave deal. Causes of not cutting back on the use of cars leads to tragic events such as the one that unfolded in Paris. Thier was so much smog in the air from motorized cars that for five days no one could start their cars unless they had a wish of paying a pricey fine. If people start to diminish the use of cars we can restore this humble planet to its former glory.

Forking out money for a car and having the luxory of fixing it up everytime a piece falls off or something malfunctions can become expensive quite rapidly. Who doesn't crave to save money anyways? Those who have chosen the suburban pioneer way of living have saved enormous enough of money. They don't have to pay for the insurance of the car and they don't have to pay to fix up the ole' rust bucket. Though some would rather have a car, but those who drive do the honors of car pulling which might not be the most time saving mechanism but in the long run it truely is beneficial. Also the government gains from all this. The government pays to build highways and roads for your car, but if cars aren't so common as time goes by roads get shorter and people start to get paid more because of all the money that the government is saving. Though money can't make us happy is still is an important piece to own in life.

In retrospect cars cause a lot of stress related problems. Everyone has one of those days where they wake up late and then suddenly remember that they have to get across town in a few minutes. Yes a car could get you there in less than no time, but wouldn't it be much simpler if you could just walk a closer distance. With the desecration of cars, stores and outlets would be much closer to your home. The stress of forgetting something at home and then having to drive 30 minutes to go get it would be diminished. Families could have more interaction with each other which means a closer bond could be formed. Receting the number of cars wouldn't be such an inhuman thing to do if you knew that the outcome was far more appealing.

To sum up, limiting the number of cars that roamed this earth would be more of a gain than a loss. Cars create hazardous gasses that are released into the air that are slowly but surely rendering us useless. Cars also cause safety hazards that can lead to a stressful environment. Plus if you don't use a car as often or get rid of it all together you can retain money for more important matters such as bills for your house or maybe a well deserved vacation. The posibilities are endless if we begin to limit the use of cars.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
4FDB610CDF7B,"Cars have become apart of the everyday life of the average person. It's a mode of transportaion that everyone uses in every second of their life; though it is faster then walking itself, cars are not always helpful to us. Sources inidcate that, by limiting car usage it is possible to relieve stress and reduce pollution.

Limiting the use of cars can bring less stress to the everyday driver. When in a car, it is easy to see when the driver is stressed out. Stress accumulates with traffic jams or when someone is becoming infuriated by another driver, who is driving right in front of the other driver and going really slow. There are people who have seen there stress levels drop when they are not in or don't own a car. For instance, a community in Vauban, Germany, at least 70 percent of their residents don't own a car, while 57 percent sold their car to move there. A woman, Heidrun Walter, who is a resident there stated, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way""(Source 1). This verifies how people can get away from stress by just not having a car. In Bogota, Colombia, there is a day when automobiles are banned for a day, with the execption of buses and taxis. This day has become very popular, and is a ""good opportunity to take away stress""(Source 3), as said by Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business man who rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife on that day. On this day millions Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work, leaving the streets free of any traffic jam, when a driver gets stressed out he most, as stated in source 3. This shows the number of people who participated in this event and also shows their, less stressful, alternative modes of transportation.

Along with relieving stress, pollution will become less of a problem. Cars are beneficial when it comes transportation, but they can cause harm to the environment as well. Pollution is a major problem in the today's world, and with the number of cars that are in use everyday it will only become worse. Smog or any other type of pollution can cause a city or even a country to take action. Such a Paris, Fance, who put a ban on driving to reduce pollution in their city, which rivaled Beijing, China, known as the one the most polluted cities in the world, as said in source 2. This strenghens the problems that cars pose on the world, these problems can lead to delivery companies losing money because the ban was put up and won't be lifted until the smog is gone. In addition, more information about car pollution can be found in source 1. There it talks about how cars are the ""linchpin"" of suburbs, and how they're ""a huge impediment to current efforts to drasticallly reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" In some places this is slowly resolving itself; places such as the United States have seen a drop in miles driven per person since it's peak in 2009. Sociologists believe that, ""it will have beneficial implications carbon emissions and the environment""(Source 4). This indicates that, while it is a major issue it is not impossible to solve it.

Cars are an easy and fast form of transportation, but they can also cause harm to people and the environment. No matter how beneficial cars are to us, wouldn't it be better to limit the use of them? This way if cars usage is limited, then the less problems we face.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Americans have always relied on a automobile for there means of transpertatio n but if we limited our automobile use our lfe's would get alot better. Other countries are doing it and there getting positive outcomes. So should we follow other countires in there no car days or car ban?

In Vauban, Germany the community is completely car free. its a experimental district that does not allow the ownership of a car, 70 percent of familes in Vaubans do not own cars 57 percent sold a care to move to Vauban. Heidrum Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way""by elimanting the use of cars this community is less stressful of traffic and has reduced emmisions.

If us as Americans used bikes or walked or took the buses to our destination, pollution and smog would decrease. In Paris a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of the global city. Paris has more smog then any other European capitals. After 2 days of the car ban the sog cleared up. Imagine if we did that here in the united states polution would go down drasticaly.

And if we stoped driving cars for a few days every week there would be lesser car accidents every year. people would have to walk to there destination or ride a bike and people would get exercise from the walking or riding the bike. We would spend less money on gasoline or desiel.

Americans car use is already have starting to decrease since 2005, If the pattern persists it will have benefial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment. So many good thigs come from using cars less and if we start following the trend our lifes and communities will soon improve.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D8F4533FD59D,"What are some advantages of limiting car usage? Some may say that there is no advantages but many would like to differ, Some advantages that we would have would be less polution , Smog, or even a chance to exercise . But lets talk about polution. Polution takes a major affect on the world and many people might not see this, but limiting car usage can help prevent this . Polution is constantly harming us and the world around us. It destroys are Ozone Layer, causes smog , and much more. And if limiting car usage can help prevent this why not? This is when todays socity kicks in to play. In todays socity some people are just to lazy i'm not saying im not guilty of this

However , i'm not saying that anyone is. See some people decide to take there cars wherever they go, even if it is just three to four blocks down the road. If we just decide to walk more maybe we can reduce polution. Let's say that you have a local Walmart or Supper store about a one mile radious away from were you live and all you need is a gallon of milk or just something to eat, im not saying spending over three hundred in grocries. Just something little why not just walk it? Now im not saying that if there was an emergancy like your kid got in an accident or your wife is in labor to walk them to the hostbitol. You should be able to use your car in those types of situations. But Like i said If we all do that for the little things we might just be able to stop polution.

Other ways to prevent this from happening? In source three the passage written by:

Selsky, Andrew it talks about a car free day! This would be an Excelent way to help prevent smog and air polution. But to make this take a major impact on the world is to get everybody to do this. not just a few states but the whole contry. This will benifit the world and you more then you might think. In passage one written by:

Rosenthal, Elisabeth there was a statement made,

""How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.""

. This stood out to me because a hybrid is an electrive operated car and some of these cars don't take or burn any fosil fules . Wich will also help prevent all of the affects cars have on the world and us. In conclusion , We should all try to walk around a little more then use are cars for little things we should all try to be a little more active and help prevent the world from getting worst then it all ready is!

EA55ED342EDE,"Car ussage isn't a must do, it's more of a want to do. Many places like Columbia, Germany and France take days off of driving to help the world and the people.

The people of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars altogether. In the outskirts near the French and Swiss border driveways, home garages and street parking are not allowed. You are still allowed to own a car but if you do choose to own one, you'll have to choose where you want to park it. There aren't many options, you can buy a space for $40,000 in one of the garages on the edge of the development. Media trainer Heidrun Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". About seventy percent of families in Vauban, Germany do not own a car and aout fifty-seven percent sold their car so they could come live in Vauban. Much like in Germany to preserve resources and maintain pollution to a minimum in Paris, a partial driving band was placed due to over pollution. The band stated that only some people could drive on certain days. For example if your license plate was an even number than you could only drive on certain chosen days and vise versa with odd numbers. If you failed to follow this rule then you would be fined a $31 or a 22-euro fine. This rule caused around 4,000 drivers to be fined and around 27 people to have their cars impounded. In the capital of France congestion in the air went down about 60 percent after intense smog for about 5 days. Also because diesel is prefered over gasoline in France diesel fuel was blamed. In western Europe around 53.3 percent of diesel engines as compared to 67 percent in France.

Hiking, biking, skating, taking buses to work these are all things that Bogota, Colombia participated in during their car free day. Doing these activities has been proven to relieve stress and lower air pollution. Cali and Valledupar joined in the event and others came to see the event. This car free day is a day that Bogota started in the 1990s, it has led to around 118 bycicle paths being constructed which is the most any city in Latin America contains. Carless people are more likely to turn to sports centers, walking on sidewalks, upscaling new restaurants and cropping up shopping districts. The time that is wasted in a traffic jam is time that you'll never get back. Might as well use it to do something that's good for you like excersising or spending time with family. In Barcelona, Spain the Ford Motor Company chairman, Bill Ford announced that to conserve resources, lower emission and to improve safety they should have public transportation and private cars and pedestrian biking connected into the network.

One of the worlds prime cultures is in the United States. Since the second largest source is transportation in America's emission. Since we have the internet and different social medias that allow us to reach our friends and family or anyone we'd like to speak with easily there is not much need for people to drive around every time that they want to see their friend. This causes teens and many others to not have getting their license as a priority which will decrease in the long run the amount of cars that are being driven around. Teenagers usually base their life around what they have to do. Whether it is going to their job or going to the gym, they find their way around it. Car-pool, public transportation or just simply walking will decrease pollution and increase your healthy level if you walk. It's a win-win either way you look at it. If you car-pool you are helping the enviroment by not polluting the air and if you use public transportation you are changing the amount of cars that are being used. Public transportation is like a large car-pool.

Places like these are the reason that the world will live longer, along with the people on it. If more places participated in events like these, there would be much less pollution in the air, much less time wasted and much less obesity. Your children and yourself could breathe better and have a brighter, much cleaner future.               ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
9F87D2FB9C3D,"Limiting car usages is becoming more popular everyday. Different places in the world are starting new days and such to limit the use of automobiles. Things such as just a day of limiting people from using their car is making a difference in the world. Limiting car usage can be an advantage becuase it is helping create new enviroments and is also changing old enviroments for the better.

The communities are being designed to help people live a different and new way. The only forms of transportation are walking and biking places. These towns however have everything built to fit this life style. In a german suburb the residents are required to not have a car in order to live in that community. If they must have a car, there is only two places to park it, a large garage at the edge of this development. In these garages a car-owner would buy a space for $40,000 along with a home. With this as a factor, 70 percent of families in this Vauban communties do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move to this new, happier suburb. In source 1, It is said that the plans of making cities better for walking is finally happening.

In source 3 a businessman said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". The use of cars stresses people out for various reasons. A day without cars is spreading, for example in colombia for the first time two other cities beside bogata joined in on the day where civilians would be fined for using a car. Smog is a big factor now-a-days aswell. Cutting back on car usage is helping many cities with smog and reducing it. In paris they restricted certian cars from driving on the road on certian days and this actaully helped the enviroment a lot aswell as helping traffic.

While cars are a big help in today's world they are not absolutley nessecary. Cars can help you be transported from one place to another but they also hurt the enviroment in various ways. Limiting car usuage is an adavantage to the world becuase not only does it help create new healthier enviroments it also is fixing the old ones and making them better for the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Sometimes riding in a car can be very stressfull having children in the car making noise and if you're late to work, but there is tons of traffic.

Does everyone agree with this no car trend? After Paris recived a near record pollution they banned driving in the city. On some days the city would allow odd licence plates. On other days the city would allow even number plates. Near 4,000 drivers were given a 31$ (22-euro) fine. This cleared the smog over a period of time. What was the effect on the city after words? Smog cleared from the city vassly but. Citizens were able to freely use the transit without cost. There wwere acceptions to plug in cars and viecles holding more than three people.

On the other side of the world people in Bogota Colombia created and set a carfree day. On this day people Hiked, Biked, and took buses to destinations.

79B0AA58D079,"Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there's always a negative; pollution. Although mobile transportations are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmfull greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed.

A small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a ""car-free"" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by far-end highways. Although Vauban is not completely car-free, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars; Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

Another insight to reduced car zones brings Paris' incident with smog. Paris' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with even-numbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with odd-numbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.

Could you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a car-free day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a car-free lifestyle has it's hassles, but in hindsight, it has it's benefits.

To conclude, living a car-free lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere world-wide would take part in air-pollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.                                                     ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Thats one of the reasons why limiting car usage would be so great for us. Another great advantage we would have by limiting car usage would be lowering stress and lowering air polution as well,""said Carlos Arturo Plaza."" Also limiting car usage would make cities denser, and better for walking, those are the advantages of limiting car usage.

First off, limiting car usage would reduce greenhouse gases. Our cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and fifty percent in car areas in the United States. That is an unbelievable percentage of greenhouse gases in Europe and an unreal percentage here in the United States. Lowering that percent would be great and alot of people would be thankful, and that would be an advantage of limiting car usage around the world.

Another advantage of limiting car usage would be lowering stress and at the same time lowering pollution. If you limit car usage and just stop driving a car, grab your bike and go for a nice bike ride, it would be a good thing if you are stressed out, it will take your mind off of things and allow you to ease the stress and just relax, and while your not even thinking about it, you wouldn't be polluting the air because your on a bicycle. That is another great advantage towards limiting car usage.

Also limiting car usage would make cities denser, and allow more walking room for people to walk around instead of having to dodge vehicles. If we limit car usage, we could probably build and make more parks where people could walk and exercise, but if we have alot of vehicles driving around, how could we do that. So therefore, limiting car usage would allow us to do that and there's another advantage of vehicles being limited.

Now do you understand how limiting car usage has its advantages? Here i'll let you know again. One it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by alot. Two it can even lower stress as well as when your not even thinking about it, lowering pollution. Not driving a car and lets just say you go for a nice bike ride, that will lower your stress, it takes your mind off of things and allows you to relax, and at the same time your lowering pollution. And finally, it will makes cities denser and allow more walking room for people. Those are the advantages of limiting car usage.         ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
2B688160509C,"Personally, I believe that there are many advantages to limiting usage of a motor vehicle. There would be less air pollution, quicker public transportation, and more social contact.

Firstly, as stated in almost every article the main goal of stopping people from driving their cars was that their was too much air pollution going on throughout these cities. There was a near-record days of pollution which made some cities in Europe decide the make partial laws to restrict people from using their cars all the time. Personally I think that is a great idea to stop people from driving cars. People not driving cars all the time benefits everyone because the air pollution would eventually be hazardous to everyone leading to casualties and deaths.

Secondly, public transportation would be so much easier to get around with since there is barely traffic around. Could you imagine how easy it would be to get around using the bus or a taxi since there would be no traffic jams or accidents on the road. Of course since basically no one would have the accessability to cars there would be much more public transportation but i doubt it would amount up to how many single cars you see on the road.

Also, one articel stated that, Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" meaning that all this occured due to the dramatic change in everyone driving their cars. I believe that this happened as a social thing because of everyone is always alone in their motor vehicle driving past everyone without a word said, rather than walking past a person with a smile on your face and making face to face contact. Usually the parks and sports centers are getting all these people in there because everyone walking or biking would pass by a park and say that they would want to hang out there for a minute since they hadn't been before or just walk in it to check it out since its on the way.

In Conclusion this is what i think of the advantages of limiting car usage. I think its good for the environment, makes public transportation quicker, and makes people more social.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

To most people safety always come first in a automobile. Its not safe to drive without license , it might seem cool but its really not. Its putting your life and maybe someone elses life in danger. Driving without license will always have you at risk because if you get stopped you going to jail . If you were to be driving a car without license and its not yours you and the person who car it is , is going to get in trouble. Limiting car usage isn't as bad it saves you from getting into any trouble or even saves you from getting hurt . Riding a bike or getting on the bus will get you from one place to another safer than driving without license .

Furthermore , we have people in the world that say they need there car to get from one place to another. Cars are not really need it , it just get you to where ever you need to go quicker. The bus will get you from where ever you are to where you need to go just not as fast as a car will. A bike will do the same thing . They both also saves you money because with a car you will need to put gas in and if it mess up its really expensive to fix it .

Limiting car usage isn't really a bad thing but banning cars is . Like I said before cars are not needed but it need to be taking good care of because its expensive to fix on the other hand, the bus cost but not as much as a car do and the bike just takes up a lot of energy and can cost some money but not as much as a car so yeah to me limiting car usage is not as bad as people say or think it is .

F182602F7221,"There are many advantages to come from not using cars as your main source of transportation. Cars pollute the earth. Cars are also very stressful. All technology is stressful. So why not use better modes of transportation.

Bikes are healthy,biking also helps reduce stress. So does walking walking by far is the best mode of transportation who doesnt like walking its healthy its fun plus it doesnt cost any money you dont have to have thousands or even hundreds of dollers to walk you have to have money to buy cars you have to have money to buy bikes even though bikes are better to cars and also does absolutely nothing to our ozone layer.

All in all cars arnt what they are cracked up to be. They are stressful,and they are slowly but surely destroying our world. Cars are expensive you have to pay gas,insurance,an if you havent paid the whole thing off yet you have to pay a car note. Cars do have their advantages. They have their pros and their cons. Their cons outway their pros so start walking,riding bikes,or using trains.

EF569281774B,"Cars are not the most important thing in our lives. Although cars are helpful, not having one can help you a lot in the long run. Having a car causes so much stress worrying about the traffic if you're going to be late for work or school, gas prices are not as low as people would like. If you had to walk everywhere or ride your bike, you could be getting a lot of exercise from it. People think having a car is so important but they dont see the positive side to it.

Many people stress out if they are not going to make it to work on time because of traffic, I know that I dont make it to school on time because of all the traffic trying to get into my school is horrible. Instead of stressing out, you can just go on a calm walk or bike ride to your destination. In the article written by, Elisabeth Rosenthal, there is a quote from Heidrun Walter saying, ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" because they had banned cars in his city. You can always find an alternative way of getting to where you need to go. If someone has a meeting to go to, they can always use the alternative of the Internet if they cant get their in time or the weather is not the best. Instead of stressing out about driving, you can walk to your destination and save money from not paying for gas.

We all know that gas prices are high and out of our budget. They've reached four dollars, that's insane! Why would anyone want to spend that money if they don't have to. There is a simple solution on saving your money that you waste on gas, and that is walking or riding your bike. Some people can afford the prices of gas but others are struggling in the economy but are to lazy to walk, nobody wants to get exercise so they drive everywhere.

Banning cars on the street is a good way to help people get exercise. If they know they can't drive, they would obviously walk or take a bike because they have places to be. It would be an effective way to get people to stop being lazy and helping their health. Some people would probably get frustrated because they have to walk everywhere but it's only helping them.

Walking or riding a bike is a good opportunity to realize the beauty of life without stressing out over bad drivers or traffic, saving money, and getting exercise. Most people would think banning cars on the street is a good idea for those few reasons. I know that it is super effective although some people may not see it until it actually changes.

2D73663127C2,"Innocent and young, children grow accustomed to the utilization of cars in society. Hot Wheelz, battery-powered Barbie SUVs, Hess Semi-trucks, and other deviations of play-friendly cars introduce the car culture to Americans from nearly the first day out of the womb. Mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, neighbors, and grandparents depend on their cars daily. This reliance on cars consequently impacted America's environment. However, limiting car usage reduces society's carbon footprint, slowly eliminating the encompassing pollution and stress of the developed car culture.

All vehicles alike release carbon emissions into the atmosphere, polluting the air and smogging our cities. Suburbs, especially, rely on automobiles to provide needed transportion. Experts state that car transportation in suburbs ""is a huge impediment"" (Source 1) when discussing ""efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes"" (Source 1). In the car-intensive areas of the United States, passenger cars hold responsibility for ""up to 50 percent"" (Source 1) of greenhouse emissions. This constant car usage pollutes American skies. Elisabeth Rosenthal states that car usage reduction ""will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" (Source 4), especially in America ""since transportation is the second larget source [of emissions]"" (Source 4). Cutting down on cars for alternative, public, or group transportation provides a solution to the car epidemic of suburban America.

In other societies where limitations of car usage occured, the majority of its denizens replied positively. In the car-depleted suburb of Vauban, Germany, ""57 percent sold a car to move [to Vauban]"" (Source 1). The influential idea of a suburb without traffic jams and long drives to stores attracted 5,500 current residents of Vauban. Futhermore, car bans in Paris reduced emissions and cleansed the air ""after days of near-record pollution"" (Source 2) and ""five-days of intensifying smog"" (Source 2). During this ban, ""congestion was down 60 percent"" (Source 2), relieving traffic and pollution. In Bogota, Colombia, a ""car-free day"" (Source 3) promotes ""alternative transportation and reduce[s] smog"" (Source 3). One Colombian businessman commented cheerfuly, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (Source 3). The relief of traffic results in the relief of stress, which city-drivers appreciate.

In America's evolving society, and the evolving global economy, limiting car usage stands benefically. Reducing smog, eliminating the stress of traffic, and preserving the environment, low car-usage societies appeal in all current circumstances. Progressively, the world may see a day where car usage is antiquated.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
3FF2C68B1B73,"The residents of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars to live in a car free enviroment. Some of the residents believe that this enviroment makes them happier. The reason behind this is because we are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that come from tailpipes. This experiment has the potential to become the most advanced experiment in low-car surburban life.

There are many places in the world that are trying this new experiment out. In the United Statesnthe Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting communities to become less dependent on cars. The legislators are starting to act on the bill and experts even expect public transpotation to play a larger role in society.

Also, in Paris, France there were days of near-record pollution. This is another reason for the experiments, to slow down the amount of pollution. Paris enforced a driving ban to slow down the pollution. The ban worked out so good that they even followed up on it afterwards.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
1312DC697706,"Society has made the car industry accelerate rapidly and over the years the amount of money these automobile company's make only increases. However, its time to look into the advantages of limiting such car usage in our communities. Studies have shown that the use of cars only increases the amonunt of stress we have. Without the usage of cars we're able to release such stressors Carlos Arturo Plaza stated in Andrew Selsky's article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". Its one thing to make the decision to start this movement on our own, but when a community becomes involved it makes a stronger impact. Car usage in America has only grown since it began however, the amount of cars being bought is beginning to show decrease. Many people are realizing that there are numerous amounts of ways to get around their city. Some are even carpooling. Although choosing other options such as the bus may take time it is still well worth the wait. We will find that many other options and opportunities come into play when we cut down on and get rid of the use of cars in our communities.

Various factors come into play when it comes to world pollution. One of the factors being the use of automobiles which increases the amount of air pollution thus damaging the ozone layer. The use of cars is second nature to us. We love the sense of indepence we get at the age of 16 when we can finally get our license. To point out, no one thinks on whats happening as we purchase cars. Instead, we rely on diesel gas to do the trick. Imagine cutting out the use of cars. With this detuction of car usage the amount of destruction done to the ozone layer will diminish tremendously. We will be able to experience clearer air just like the communities that participate in this action. For instance, in an article done by Robert Duffer titled ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" we can witness through testimony the wonders done by banning car usage. Normally Paris has high amounts of pollution but in order to change this the city enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air temporarily. The fact that the city had cold nights and warm days doesn't do anything to help because these nights and days only allow for the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. After the banning of car usage Paris was finally able to experience clear air. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 ,micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with the 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London... "" (excerpt from source 2 ""Paris bans driving due to smog"").

To be clear, no one's against car usage, but after considering the costs of using cars you'd realize its not worth it. Residents of Vanban, Germany find this statement to be true and have therefore regulated their lives around it. Elizabeth Rosenthal created an article on the residents from Germany titled ""In German Suburb, Life Goesn On Without Cars"". Here she discussed what the community has done in their no car movement. Residents here do not regret their decision to get rid of their cars and actually like it better than dealing with the uncontrollable and frustrating traffic jams. Not to mention the countless amount of car wrecks that come along with it. In this particular part of Germany the government has assisted in the movement. There are no street parking spots, driveways or home garages. Some might think its absurd but when theres no cars theres no need for such things. They have even improved sidewalks and made the city commute friendly with stores only a walk distance away. A mother from Germany gives her account of living in Vauban and states the following: ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" She is a media trainer and a mother of two. In previous bills, 80 percent of the money from the government had gone to highways and 20 percent to other transports, but with the smart planning movement that will change within the next 6 years.

All in all, many factors come into play when discussing transportation within a city. However with the deduction of car use a city can recieve many benefits including an increase in money for other government spending, clearer air, happiness, more money in their pockets among many other things. We just have to decide whether enough is enough. The facts have proven themselves worth it for many other countries, why can't it be successful for us as well?    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
07F7F67833DD,"A day without drivng your car? who can't do that. Also making the Earth a better place to live? awsome! Taking advantage of a limiting car using its a great idea because people are lowering air pollution and there's no more rush-hour. Getting stuck in traffic isn't pretty nice and most likely if you have a meeting your going to be late. Also people just dont want to own cars anymore.

To start off, I like the idea that people are limiting their car usage because people are lowering air pollution. In source 2, the author explains ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog .. rivaled in Beijing, China, Which is known as one of the most polluted cites in the world."" This means that cars are bad for the enviroment they had to decresse the number of cars so they could stop the smog becuase they didn't wanted to end up like china. But however, not useing cars is affecting car industry like it states in source 4 ""since transportation is the second larges source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implication for the car industry."" Never the less, air pollution is the main problem like in source 3 in Bogota ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" The reason they are doing this is for people to find another way to get to their destination and to reduce smog as it states.

Furthermore, I like the idea that people are limiting their car usage because there's no more rush-hour. Advoiding traffic is great like in source 3 "" Bogota, Colombia- In a program that's spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or tok buses to work during a car-free day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic."" Colombian's do this to advoid traffic and its a cool way because you could ride bikes and skated. Likwise in source 4 some Children don't get their driver license its not because they're lazy it's because they don't need them, yeah they come in handy but they're not interseted for example in source 4 they stated ""They organized their summer jobs and socail life around where they can walk or take public ransportation or car-pool with friends."" having a car isn't a teenager main interst, they rather walk to a close by place or car pool with their friends.

To sum up, in my opinion I think limiting car usage is a great idea because less air pollution, rush-hour, and some people just don't want to own cars.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
30B617145AF6,"All over the world, major cities are trying to reduce their use of cars. From Germany, to France, to Columbia, and coming back to the US, people are limiting car use to reduce pollution, or live better, or even to save money. In some places, there is one day every year that doesn't allow cars. In other places, there are whole communities that dont allow cars year round.

In Germany, there is a community in named Vauban that doesnt allow cars unless you have the money to pay for a parking spot that is on the outskirts of town. The revolutionizing community makes peopl epay $40, 000 dollars just for one parking spot. This wonderful new place has reduced the amount of greenhouse gas produced in the last few years drastically, with 70% of the population not owning a car. This has encouraged many other countries to start somehting just like it.

The city of love may not be so lovely if it's so smoggy you can barely see. Paris was gaining so much air pollution from the amount of gas that was released from driving hta tthey put a ban on driving. This ban consisted of a few new rules to help prevent the smog from overpowering the beauty of the city. On Mondays, even numbered license plates were not allowed to use theie car for anything. This same rule applied to the odd numbered license plates on Tuesdays. This helped limit the amount of driving, in return limiting the amount of smog. Smog is created when the area has cold night weather and warm day weather, causing the air to trap car emission. Diesel can be a big contributer to this and is the main gas type in France. France favors diesel because of their taxing system, but it seems they don't care too much about their environment.

What would happen if every country had a day with no cars? The city of Bogota, Columbia has had a Day without cars once a year for quite a few years. Just recently, other Colubian cities have joined in and even Paraguay's captial has participated. What this day is supposed to do is promote the use of other types of transportation, for example; walking or biking. It also reduces smog and the amount of air pollution, in retalliation, improving the city. In Bogota, there is a $25 fine for those who do not participate in thsi environtmentally helpful day.

Although the amount of driving in the US has decreased since 2005, there is more we can do to help the situation. The average number of miles driven did peak in 2005 and drop from there, in return, dropping other statistics as well. As of April of 2013, the number of driven miles has dropped 9% below the peak, being the same as in January of 1995, says  Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives. The roads have even become safer  due to the amount of young drivers dropping 23% between the years of 2001-2009. Even if the number of miles hadn't peaked, there still wouldn't be as many drivers on the road because of the recession. Americans couldn't afford to but cars due to the amount of money lost during that horrible time.

All through the world, people are trying to slowly save their environment by reducung car use. From one day to a whole year, everything helps to save our world. The German community of Vauban has made it nearly impossible to own a car. Paris, at one point, had to put restrictions on their driving. Columbia has an annual day of no cars. The US is working on lowering thier use of cars and dropping their average miles to help clear the air surrounding them. Even if it is walking from point A to point B, it helps the community and lowers air pollution.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E9B656D67E94,"Not many can imagine life without a car. Yet despite how essential these machines may seem to our daily routines, the modern-day automobile is in fact another redundant aspect in our pursuit of more efficent transportation. The fact and concept of pollution comes into play.

On a sunny day in the streets of Paris the sky runs a depressing gray, and it feels difficult to breath. Paris is known for its near-record pollution, prompting officals  to enforce a temporary cesation in the use of automobiles. As Robert Duffer States in the article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"": ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31),"" this procedure has been followed to the letter and approximately 4,000 drivers were fined in total. Subsequently, the net amount of smog has been drasticaly reduced over time, with ignorant blames on diesel as a correlatin to France's favor of it over gasoline which completely ignored the other constituant:the effect cold and warm wheather itself had in the proces of containing CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) and other pollutants in the lower layers of the atmosphere. However, the desired levels of pollution have been reached, and the ban on driving lifted.

With the concept of pollution among others, the future of the automobile as we know it is being threatened with extinction. Perhaps one day when China completes its plans for an intercontinental Mag-Lev transportation system and when Virgin Mobile perfects its new scram-jet design in tandem with Lockheed-Martin as well as Elon Musks countless innovations in electrical engineerng, the human race will look upon this era with pride to know what they've come from and what they've achieved thus far.                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
3B9E54F5907B,"In countries all throughout the world, there are many reasons why limited (private) car usage would be very beneficial. Overall, it would benefit individual families by limiting costs spent on gas and even the huge payment of buying a car. Also, it would hugely cut back on the harmful gas emissions from the cars of individuals who choose to privately drive everywhere. Lastly, many countries have

As previously stated, limiting car usage would reduce the cost of buying cars and paying for the gas to use those cars. You can spend as much as $50 on gas a day, and because gas is a nonrenewable resource, the demand for it will only increase over time, as will its cost. Additionally, the economies of many countries such as the United States are not at their best, therefore making it difficult for many families to come up with the money to even buy a car. The $40,000 you spend on buying a car when there are alternative options such as walking, biking, or taking the bus could be spent on more important things like healthcare, insurance, food, and entertainment. According to Source 4, ""recent studies suggest aht Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Obviously people would not be making these changes if it wasn't proving to be beneficial to them.

Secondly, cars are a huge source of air pollution to our planet. If we don't limit our car usage, who knows what will happen to our ozone layer and ecosystem. According to Source 2, countries like Paris have already noticed this and are taking the initiative to prevent further pollution. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.""

0D5CB5729E22,"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Like conserving resources when we dont drive cars. It also lowers emission and imprves safety as said in Source 4: The End of Car Culture. When you stop using cars pollution will decrease. And when the pollution decreases the earth will be healthier. Being able to drive at 16 doesnt help the advanages but between 2001 and 2009 23% of young teens stopped driving. Some advantages are its helps the enviroment, keeps people safe, and also gets pople to exercise.

The first advantage is that it helps the enviroment. Cars pollute the air a lot and if we limit the usage of cars then the air will slowly become more clean. Also the cars cause smog. With the use of cars stpping the smog will clear. As stated in Source 1: The End of Car Culture, the United States has long been one of the worlds prime cultures. But as people started to drift away from their cars, the US peaked in 2005 and is still steadily dropping. When here is cold nights and warm days the warmer layer of air traps te car emissions.

The second reason with limiting car usage is a good idea is because it keeps everyone safe. The pollution is bad for peoples health. Also a lot of people actuall get hit by cars so limting the use will cause less injuries. You wont always be looking out for the pedestrians. Also kids are the ones who get hit by cars most because you cant see the so no cars means less children getting hurt. Another good thing that will come out of limiting car usage is that we will se less gas and then we will have more natrual resources. Passener cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in car-intensive areas in the US as stated in Sourc 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

The final reason why limiting car usage is because it gets people to exercise. A lot of people are couch patatoes, especially in America, and dont do anything so having limitations with their car will have to make them move a little. All people like to do is use their phone or eat or watch Netflix on their free time but having no car will make them do more physical things. Having no car wll make people ride bikes from poin A to point B r even walk. Have fast food places n very corner doesnt help either because it makes peope get in their car to drive what could have been a five minute walk. When ave you ever seen a person walk to get food? Never.

Inconclusion, there are many advantages in limiting car usage like it elps the enviroment, kes people safe, and makes eople exercise. People are safe. The enviroment is slowly getting better. People are starting to exercise whether they like it or not. In some countries if yu own a car you have o pay $40,000 to have a parking space, along with what you aid for the house.

5BC00A6050F7,"Limiting the usage of your vehicle comes with many advantages to not only yourself but the enviornment as well. If you were to put the vehicles away and walk or bike to school or work, you would burn a lot of calories. Not only would you help yourself in that way but you would help the enviorment in many different ways. It might take more time to do stuff without a vehicle but it will help you more in the long run. There are limitless advantages to using other forms of transportation.

Walking or biking to school would take longer and it would take more of your time. But while doing this, you not only burn many calories but you get yourself in better shape. Continuesly doing this for a month or so would get you in top shape, making it easy for you to get to your location within the same amount of time as a vehicle. Doing this will help your body both mentally and physically while also giving your wallet a break on gas money. What's there not to love about getting in shape and saving money at the same time.

While saving money on gas, you would save the enviornment from the gas. Vehicles cause a lot of pollution and can even build a layer of smog over cities. These layers of smog get stuck in the air, making the area it's around warmer. The amount of pollution within the world is absurd, and if everyone were to stop using vehicles that would cut down the total pollution by a large portion. Lower air pollution is also shown to take away stress, and lowering the use of your vehicle would also get rid of the stress of other drivers.

The only negative thing about cutting down the use of vehicles would be the time it takes to get to your desired location. Riding a bike may take twenty minutes more, but think of all of the benefits in the long run. You lose twenty minutes from having to ride your bike, but you get to enjoy the experience of riding the bike and your body enjoys the benefits from riding the bike. The world is suffering from all of the pollution, and you losing twenty minutes to a simple bike ride would help the world last longer by a great amount. It may not make a big difference with one person but if everyone limits the usage of their vehicles, they could greatly help the world.

So why would  you not limit the usage of your vehicles? With all of the benefits you gain from doing so, you have no reason to not lower it. You could make a change for both your physical health and the health of the enviorment. The benefits of cutting down on the usage of your vehicles greatly outnumber the negatives. So what's more important to you, losing twenty minutes to a beautiful bike ride or polluting the enviorment and ruining the area you live in? There are no reasons to why you should not cut down on the usage of your car.                    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Lastly, a reduction of car use can vastly improve the economy.  In Bogota, Colombia, the local government have begun to enforce a ""Day Without Cars"" in an effort to curb rising pollution levels.  This has been happening for three years, and has increased profits for small shops and eateries in the area.  Because of the large number of walkers and bikers, shops were able to make a larger profit with walk-ins that just happened to pass by the store.  This is what caused more stores to open up, thus  boosting the local economy.  Even businessmen are enjoying these days as stated by Carlos Arturo Plaza.  ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

To end this off, cars use can be greatly reduced.  It is a matter of willpower, which everyone has, but some are too  lazy to tap into it.  The reduction of car use will have long term effects on both you and the globe.  By minimizing the time you spend in a car, you are increasing your happiness, decreasing pollution, and helping boost the economy!  If you think cars are a necessity in today's shrinking world, think again.  New York is a perfect example in which rush hour traffic makes it impossible to get to work on time by car.  Even in new small suburbs, cars are becoming a thing of the past.  Tomorrow, instead of driving to work or to the store, try walking.  You just might enjoy it.

Violators faced a $25 fines. when people have cars they began to become tease because of the stress of driving especillay all the crazies behind the wheel. with cars free day is stop all traffic and provide a day away from stress and lower air pollution.

car free day was started in Bogtoa,Colombia in the mid 1900s with a plan to spread car free day to the countries, to encourage millions of colonbians to hike,biked,skated or took buses to work during car free day and to create a 118 mile bicyle path. even the side walk that was once uneven and pitted,and replace by broad smooth sidewalk. rush hour restrictions have cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping disricts have cropped up. parks and sports centerts also have bloomed throughout the city.

CA2129BF0A69,"Within countries around the world people are coming together, whether it be the polititians or the citizens, they are all beginning to put an end to the use of cars on a daily bases. In Germany there is a suburban city where the majority of its' streets are relatively free of cars and the residents of this ""car-free"" city seem quite content. Germany isn't alone in wanting to rid the world of cars along with the pollution and stress it brings, Paris, France is another of the handful of places that would prefer to begin an anti-car revolution. There are days in Paris that, when the smog is too much to bare and the air is hardly breathable, they are forced to enforce a partial driving ban. After about a week the air was noticably cleaner. While Vauban, Germany and Paris, France have joined the fight in kicking cars to the curb in their own particular ways, three cities in Colombia have also decided to become a member of the ever growing ""car-free"" city club by starting a program that sponsers a car-free day once a year.

Taking a closer look at the suburban city of Vauban, Germany, it is easy to see the reason as to why the country would create a city free from cars along with parking spaces. When thinking of suburban cities most people create a mental image of large buildings spread far apart from public homes or neighborhoods with long winding roads and intersections packed with automobiles. Considering most of the popular suburban cities throughout the world match this description, it is not completley inaccurate, but most people fail to also imagine the abundancy of smog and other forms of pollution that invade the cities because of the gaseous fumes released by cars and other vehicles. Vauban has greatly decreased the amount of air pollution in their city by simply eliminating the amount of automobiles out on the roadways. According to the article titled ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 5, cars are the cause for up to twelve percent of greenhouse gases emersed into the air in Europe while in some areas of the United States the amount of gases released into the air is around fifty percent. By eliminating the amount of cars used in Vauban, Germany they are creating friendly air for its' residents to breathe. Going back to the image most people in the world assume a suburb would look like, winding roads seem to take up the majority of space between stores and residential homes. In Vauban they have reconstructed the roadways and car garages into walkways and new stores so the residents have more access to the places they need to be. The elimination of the amount of roads and highways have helped Vauban to also put forth more money into other ways of transportations as opposed to using the majority of money on the contructions of highways and such. When reading the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 9 it states that in most of the previous bills passed has claimed that nearly eighty percent of appropriations have gone to highways while an estimated amount of twenty percent has gone to other forms of transportation.

Next on the list of cities that are attempting to put an end to car use would be Paris, France. Within Paris there are gorgeous sights to see and the majority of them could be seen and reached by a simple bike ride and there is really no need to fill the air with more pollution with an unnessasary car. This is what most of the people in charge of Paris believe which is why they created partial driving bans. The smog within Paris, France can, at times, rival even the amount of air pollution in Beijing, China which is infamous for being the most polluted cities in the entire world as was said in the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 14. While Paris officials wanted to completley eradicate driving completley so that the smog would disappear, they knew that with the millions of drivers in Paris that it could not be completley banned all at once. To help illiminate the smog and still keep from having too many issues with its' citizens, Paris decided to make it so that one day the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be permitted to drive their vehicles and the next day only drivers with odd numbered license plates were banned from driving. They continued this pattern for a week. Of course, there were some people who decided to drive their cars whether or not it was banned, so the officials came to the conclusion that anyone who broke the partial banning rule would have to suffer a twenty two euro fine. According to the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 12, nearly four thousand drivers were fined throughout that week. Regardless of the people who went against this rule sixty percent of congestion was illiminated in Paris after that week.

After Paris on the countdown of cities to help the cause of limiting car usage comes Bogota, Colombia. In this heated city nearly seven million people populate, they have a program where one day out of every year that cars are completley banned from use. Everyone in the population participates by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses wherever they want to go according to the article ""Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into A Big hit In Bogota"" by Andrew Selskey in paragragh 20. By this city promoting the use of buses, taxis, and other forms of transportations they're reducing smog and the amount of traffic jams and accidents throughout their city. After three years of this day being made two other Colombian cities have joined in to participate. The cities being Cali and Valledupar, Colombia. The day without cars was part of an improvement plan that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s according to the article titled ""Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit In Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky in paragrapgh 27. By participating in this day, the people of Bogota have seen the construction of one hundred and eighteen miles of bicyce paths and added parks and sports centers all over the city.

Within the United States of America there are thousands upon thousands of cars used every day, but this may not last forever. Across the span of around eight years the amount of young people driving and obtaining their licenses has drastically decreased according to the article ""The End Of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 32. More people are taking buses or taxis or simply walking or biking to their destinations because with the growth in population over the last few years the traffic jams are unbearable and seem to take more time then to simply bike to work or school. If a car is used and is needed than most people in America seem to take to car-pooling with a friend or neighbor which in turn helps to decrease the amount of air pollution in the country.

BD321CC18709,"Mostly everyone is aware of the so called ""global warming"" and air pollution issues we have going on around the world. Both of those are mainly caused by motor vehicles that we use on a dialey basis. Lately places around the world, like Paris and China, have been trying their very best to limit the percentages of these and the pollutant in the air by banning cars for one or more days and having citizens rely on taxis, buses, walking, bikes, etc.

Because of this, scientists have already began to prove that the percentage of air pollutant has gone down, not drastically but there is at least 9% less, which is still improvment. Less air pollutant also means healthier citizens, which is what these countries are mainly aiming for in this experiment which they call ""smart planning"".  They began this study in cities to make them less denser and better for walking, now they have move their plan over to the suburbs.

In Paris they banned all vehicles with even number plates for the day and vehicles with odd numbered plates the next. Violators were fined a 22-euro($31) ticket. In Vaubban, Germany they have asked people the gove up cars and the roads a ""car-free"" zone, excpet for the tram and a few of the streets on the edge of the community. They also had large garages down at the egde of the community which were sold for $40,000 along with a house.

Studies have also shown that along with physical health, citizens ahve been happier and more ""stress-free"" when it comes to not driving. one mom in Vauban said it was nice the hear the swish of bicycles and chatter of children instead of the occasional distant motor. America was a step ahead of all these other coummunities though. Their number or cars and liscense that have been given a year has a decreased effincently and is almost the same as it was in 1995.            ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

""All of our developement since World War II has been centered on the car, and that needs to change."" says David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. The question every pereson who is legal to drive ""How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.

Passengers cars are responsible 12 percent of greenhoudse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. In the United States the Enviormental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a larger part in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

Next, After days of near-record pollution , paris enforcd a partial driving ban to clear th air of the global city. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leve their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to the odd-numbered plate sthe following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to the international news agency(Reuters). Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France ,after five -days of intsensifying somg. Diesel fuel was blammed, since France has a tax policy theat favors diesel over gasoline. Paris typically ahs more smog than other European capitals. Las week Paris had 147 microgramsof particulate matter. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday. The somg cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party rescined the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday.

Last, Recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licensices as each year goes by. That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question ""Has America passed the peak of driving?"" America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. The United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter. As of April 2013, the number of mile driven per person was nearrly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in the year 1995.

In the article ""In German Surburb,Life Goes On Without Cars"" Heidrun Walter states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Having a car is always stressful you always have to think if your car needs gas or your always stuck in traffic. Without a car we don't have to worry about things like that. Not having a car is always helpful for people's body, they go out more for walks and that helps them be more active. in the article ""The End of Car Culture"" they are asking them self ""Has America passed peak driving?"". In these year there are not some many cars in the streets as there used to be. People perfer to take a bus or ride there bikes to work.

Using a car can also be a benift. How can people get to places that are far away, not by walking or not taking the bus. What happens if the theb route your taking dosen't go where you need to be. The perfect solution is getting a car. You can car-pool your friends. However the gas price keeps going up. All the money you spend on your car bill.

To begin with, cars have a big impact on polution and limmiting car usage would reduse gas emissions. It may not seem that much but shown in source one cars alone is responisble for 12% of polution in europe and  50% in the uninted states. Also its obviouse that private car ownership is increasing  because people see it as freedopm and thats a problem. Goverment is trying to densinin citys and areas so cars wont be such a nessesity. life without cars would be just fine a perfect example are the suberbs area of germany where practicaly no one has a car and they love it.

In addition, Money. Cars come with a lot of expencies and now they come with more. well lets see a couple tens of thousands of dollars for the car, insurance , gas thats causeing the problem and fes for people who dont want to make a change. In source two people where asked to limit driving and people who didnt where fined 31 dollars. people are so depend most people where in out rage and got thier car impounded. life is to reliant on cars for day to day activity and smaller citys are soffocating in smog.

Also, limmited car use could help communitys bond. With public transportantion closer ad local shopping areas instead of drving along a highway just to get to a mall. with a little help from public transportion i think it would impact a nations heath with unregognized excercise. simple walks for dady to day things and less polution is an over all benifit in conclusion, people should think about the affects of car emissions and help a new trend.

It has also been said by many people that they feel better without cars. People now a days are even loosing interest in cars. Although cars do get us to places faster and they are very useful, there are more advantages for us as human beings and for our planet Earth. Without our planet Earth, we won't have anywhere to live in so let's get rid of cars.

According to source two, ""Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."". This all happened because paris banned driving and everyone was ordered to leave their cars at home or would have to pay a 22-euro fine, better understood as $31 in the United States. The air of the city had ""147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London"" (source 2). By banning driving for five days, the air in this city was cleared out tremendously. This is good for us because we need clean air to breath, we can't breath air that is not healthy for us. If we do, we're all going to die sooner or later and it's all going to be our fault.

It is also an advantage that by limiting cars, people feel better. According to source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, they have an event in which driving is banned for a whole day. Violators, of course, would get fined if they don't follow this event. A resident from here, Carlos Arturo Plaza, said that ""It's a good oppportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (Source 3). This means that cars have been having people stressed out and I know it's true. Imagine coming out of work at three in the afternoon and you have to sit through traffic for an hour. By the time you get home, all you want to do is sleep, rest and relax. Source three also tells us that ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city"". It's so much better seeing everyone having fun and getting more involved in their community and not having to sit through rush hour after work. Because many people have been seeing that not being allowed to drive helps us in so many ways, ""the Environmenta Protection Agency is promoting 'car reduced' communities"" (source 1). This will help everyone and they are hoping that public transport will play a larger role in the next upcoming years.

Since people all over the world have been noticing the differents advantages that banning driving has for us, they are actually loosing interest in cars. According to source four, ""a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009..."". Instead of making this be seen as a bad thing, it's actually a good thing. As I said before, less cars in the streets means less polluted air. And in this case since young people aren't that interested in getting their driver's license, there will be less accidents and less people dying. For example, source 3 gives us an example of how two adults of the age of 19 and 21 have not bothered to get their driver's license. They just don't make it their priority because they know that they can always just get on the publlic transit, walk, or carpool with their friends.

In Conclusion, banning driving will make people feel better, they will enjoy life more. The air will be less polluted because the streets will not have cars polluting it. Also, there will be less accidents and people will live longer because of this. We will all receive advantages by banning cars. Some peolple might complain at first but they will soon notice, it's all for their good.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" article they talked about the people walking or bicycling to work or places they wanted to go. Many people might have decided to not take a car to go places because there was limited parking, which only consists of two parking garages. Now, 70 percent of families don't own cars in Vauban, which is shocking because they all either walk or take a bicycle ride.

Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. The United States of America is now responding to these other countries and their way to reduce car usage. Obama ambitious gaols to curb the United States greenhouse gas problem might be paying off. The article ""The End of Car Culture states ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" If Americans are buying less vehicles than that's a way to a good start for lowering greenhouse gases.

A little community in  Vauban, Germany was the fist city to let go of their cars. Residents say they feel much less stress than when they had cars. What a suprise that not having to worry about traffic would reduce stress. It has also drastically reduced tailpipe emissions. They're have been rearangments by stores, they have been relocated along public sidewalks so that people no longer hae to drive across town to the mall or stores. They can simply walk or bike down the road to pick up whatever might interest them.

The next place that picked up this amazing wonderful idea was none other than the busiest city in France; Paris. Paris ordered its citizens to leave their car at home, and if they didn't comply would pay a 22-euro fine. 4000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to this fine, but if I was able to buy a car and not drive then I would be among those who would have their car impounded. On the bright side congestion went down 60% which is amazing for one of the busiest cities in the world.

The next place thats wanting to pick up this no car trend is none other than right here in the United States, and were supporting it. Each year that goes by recent studies have suggest that Americans aren't buying as many cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. If this pattern progresses it could solve our atomosphere problem. If huge cities and like Paris,Vauban,and The United States will give up cars. Than that alone could drastically change the path that our planet is headed for.

Well earth has a greenhouse effect, all the emissions for tailpipes gets traped. If you live in a high elevated area you most likey have a lot of polluted air. In the first passage

In German Suburb, life goes on without cars it states that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions"", ""in the Untied States up to 50 percent in some areas. All of these gases from our cars causes so much pollution. In the second artical it states that ""paris had near-record pollution"", this is not a good thing, our earth can only take so much. All this pollution is not good for our earth. If we limit car usage the better our earth will be and the better we will be able to breath.

Furthermore, the less we use our car the less gas we have to buy. Not using our car that much can actually save us money. Its better than getting fined in France. We waste so much money on cars, from the gas to the insurance bills to the hula dancing girl on the dashbored. Why not trade in our car in for a bike.

Last but not least, if we get a bike, we will be saving gas money, we will not be polluting the air with the emissions, and we will be getting exersize. exersizing is relaxing. It relases stress. Also you wont have to stress about waiting in traffic and the time. Riding a bike has way lass traffic than cars.

in conclusion, some people can not image their life without a car, but life without a car is honestly better. Less pollution for our earth. We will save money without cars. There are many ways to get to places with out a car. and you can get exersize with some of those other ways. Their is so many more options than cars, and there better. so limitaing the car have many advanteges and theses are just some.                        ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
30C658C339C5,"In this generation we live in, a large number of people depend on cars. Cars are a huge help in society. They can cool you down on a hot summer day, or heat you up on a cold winter night. A place that would normally take a day to walk, a car can get you there in hours. It seems that these cars are the most helpful thing that has been invented, besides silverwear. However They are also very dangerous. They let out toxic chemicals that are slowly hurting the Earth. Thats why They're some citys that are trying to boycot cars. One example is Vauban, a city in Germany. The community is has giving up driving cars. Driveways and garages are forbidden in this district and if you look at the streets they are empty of cars. All of this goes to the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars tailpipes.

In the United States, the Envionmental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced communites and A few people are starting to act. Even President Obam's has ambitious goals to curb the United States Greenhouse gas emissions. The United States is the world's prime car cultures. However America's obsession with vehicles is starting to decrease. The number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily. Also as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak. Difernt things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift. Is it possible a recovery is underway? The next years will tell.            ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
ABEA672F96E3,"In today's world our environment is not as healthy as it was year's ago. There are many green house gases disturbing our atmosphere and our ozone layer. One of the main reasons this is happening is due to motor vehicals. Car's, trucks', motorbike's, gasoline powred or diesal powerd, they all hurt our environment. There are some place's that are trying to stop the gases from hurting us and it is helping.

Owning a car is an important way of transportation. It allows us to get from point A to point B in time's that would be much slower if we did not have a car. Yet car's and truck's can sometimes be hurtful. Owning a car can be cost effective, you must pay for the fuel that is hurting the atmosphere, if it breaks down you must pay for expensive parts and service. Even if you have the money and the time to own a car, you are realy still hurting the environment by burning fosil fuels and causing green house gases.

In some place's in the wrold they are reducing car usage. They are having national days where if you use your motor vehical you are to be charged by ticket for some money. In paris there was a week of regulated driving to reduce smog emision. On several day's of the week car's with even numbers on their tag were not able to drive. The next day the odd number did the same, if caught using a motor vehical you would be fined 22£ ($31). People were outraged and some were so angered they didn't like he law and got thier vehical impounded. That is how Paris did their part in helping the atmosphere.

In Bogota, Colombia they had a similar ocasion, but only for one day of the year. They have done the same thing on that specific day for the past 3 years, they too have been charged with tickets for $25 if found using a motor vehical. They also had this day in two other citys in Colombia, Cali, and Valledupar joined in on the fun of helping the environment.

In the U.S President Barack Obama has had goal's to also reduce emision's of motor vehicals. The United State's being one of the main counrty's in car production see's owning a car a culture, they see driving, working on your own car, and racing as a way of life. But some american's have had enough of trafic jam's, stressed out lives in a jam packed city full of car's and truck's causing green house gases. They have reduced the miles driven since 2013, and a good amount of people don't even want to have a license. In crowded city like New York they have started a new bike sharing program, their tolls for bridges and tunnels have skyrocketed. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. This means people are getting more involved in helping the environment and reducing hurtful gases that hurt our ozone and our atmosphere.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
BD49014E35BB,"The idea of not having a car is quiet unsettling. Think about the palces you have to go and how far the are. Wouldn't it be a disadvange to not have a car? Would you believe me if i told you there is a suburban area that has little to no cars in its area or a specific day cars are banned for 24 hours? how about how much cleaner the air is over there? The amount of space and walkway in an area like that, would that be a pro or con for you?

People all over have participated in local events where cars are banned for a day, like Paris and Colombia, and some want to get rid of it completly like Vauban, in Germany. In Vauban, its a ""car-free"" zone. Living in an area like this without a car is alot less tence without all the extra of cars. acording to Heidrun Walter ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" supporting the idea of the reductuion of vehicles and fossil fuel admission. This is an advantage to people because they perfer a healthy, stress free life, according to the passege, ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"".

Smog is usually because of fossil fuel admission. This is why Paris proposed a partial ban to vehicles. Paris nearly had a near-record pollution. Paris was a little more operatable, according to the passege ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Beijing,China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Less congestion is a valid reason to limit vehicle use, being more spacious and operatable.

People may complain about the penalties or the transportation is needed, but people can carpool, and transportation was free in that limited time frame. eventually the fog was less visable, and people could return to the normal lives. However the damage is continuing, Getting a smart car would be a splendid idea, trade the bad fossil fuel car, to provied clean transportation if needed.  Cars are hurting the world and living things in it, including ourselfs. We should take a stand and end this tragedy were casing.               ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
EC6951950490,"The advantages in limiting car use is very important.  we would have towrroy as much as we do about drunk drivers or someone dying becasue of car crashes.  We alwys hear on te news about how someone was killed by drunk driving if we limit car usage the deaths of people would be at an all time low.  Also limiting car usage would also mean not as much polution.  we breath in a lot of polution through the day because when trucks drive by all that black smoke goes up into the air that we breath in, that can't be good for our bodies.

Anoter example would be gas, we always complain about how much gas is if we limited cars then we wouldnt have to pay for gas anymore.  To have cars we pay insurance every month if we didnt have cars imagine on how much money we would be saving, on not paying for insurances or gas and other things we need for our cars to be in good shape and safe for us to drive.  Another thing is walking or riding bikes t get to point A to poin B would decrease the chance for obeasty.

I think less crime would happen if we limited cars. For example less peope would be hit, it wouldnt promote drunck driving, it would help the population, and we would have less money problems.  Amerca is in debt so if we limit car usage we could pay off that debt and we would be helping te world at the same time.  By not poluting the air, Our bodies would be in better shape because we would have to walk or ride ikes to get somewhere.

In conclusion, I think if we limit car usage America would be a better lace to live in.  Not as many deaths, money problems, or polution.  In my essay I listed examples of how it would help the economy and people around the world. The world would be a better place with no cars to worry about.  money would not be an issue for most of us wwe would have one less thing to worry about.      ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
C94D88474063,"Imagine it's a bright, sunny day. A family decides they want to go to the park. I know you're thinking, ""OK. Then they'll get in the car and go"", but this family doesn't get into a car. This family rides their bikes to the park and sometimes even walks. Matter of a fact all of their neighbors are doing the same. Many cities are now car-free and are enjoying every bit of it.

In Vauban, Germany, the residents have given up their cars and gone for a more pioneer life style. In source 1 it says, ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district."" Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places available for parking-large garages, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and the 57 percent sold a car to move there. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says, "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" When walking down streets, the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children drown out the occasional distant motor.

In Paris, France, there recently has been days of near-record pollution so they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air. Motorists were offered to leave their cars at home or pay a fine of 22-euro ($31), almost 4,000 drivers were fined and many had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Diesel feul was blamed for intensifying smog, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. In source 2 it says, ""Diesels make up 67 pecent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of desiel engines in the rest of Western Europe."" The smog, soon enough, cleared up and the ruling French party rescinded the ban for odd-numbered plates.

In Bogota, Columbia, there is now a car-free day where millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. This has been the third year straight where cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city. Uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by smooth sidewalks. Rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

In conclusion, it seems that residents in car-free cities are more stress-free, happy, and taking care of air pollution. These advantages of limiting car usage should appeal to a lot of different countries now. I'm not saying we should ban cars all together, (because I really enjoy driving), but maybe just cut down on it and enjoy the outdoors for once.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
8F959F530F03,"A Car Free Future?

Is the car necessary in the 21st Century? Many city planners and government officals around the globe dont think so. Car free days are becoming common place in Europe and South America, and in the German town of Freiburg, an upscale neighborhood where cars are banned, has been a kind of experiment for larger towns and cities without cars. In Paris smog levels have gotten so high, that people have been asked not to drive their cars, in order to reduce pollution levels.

In the United States, the number of miles driven peaked in 2005, but has dropped nine percent since then. This is largely due to the 2008 recession, but also due to more people becoming educated about the effects that cars have on the environment. More people are choosing to take public transport, or carpool, because mainly it's cheap, and it's good for the environment.

Many key sociologists believe that this trend will continue. One of those sociologists is Professor Mimi Sheller, Diector of the Mobilities Research and Policy center at Drexel University. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift"" there are many factors that point to the ""major cultural shift"" that Proffesor Shelley referred to. For example,the renewal of city centers has made the suburbs seem less appealing, and has drawn many people into the cities. Many carpooling apps have appeared in the last 2 years.

Better cities, more public transport, and an increase in telecommunications is the start of a global movement to reduce pollution and increase efficiency. the age of the car is coming to an end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
426D179A5178,"In the US many people use different methods to get around. They walk, take a bus, but many use some sort of automobile. All these ways are very efficent but have you ever thought of maybe the outcomes of what cars do to the planet we live on? Let me tell you the things that would change of limiting car usage.

To start off, having to always worry about paying car payments or getting gas can be very pesky knowing you already have to pay for housing,food,clothing and if you have kids supporting them. All that can be very stressfull and make life even harder to live with, like in source 1 mother of two, Heidrun Walter talks about how ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Her not having a car made her life way less stressfull and tense then before hand.

Another outcome of limiting car usage would be less pollution. All these fumes are not good for the planet we live on and deffintley not good for us human beings. In source 2 it says how Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from all the gases in the air from moter vehicles. You know how much fumes would have to be in the air for them to make a driving ban? I mean if thats not putting up a red flag i don't know what would. We only have one place to live right now and its our jobs to keep it clean and protect it.

Without cars people are gonna have to find a way to get around. In source 3 it talks about the millions of Columbians finding that way when they didn't have there car to do that for them. They looked too hiking, skating, and walking. All these alternatives are a great way to live a healtheir life then to just let machines do the work. When you exercise more its said to widen your life span and prevent diseases like Diabetes or Obesity. Being able to live better heatheir lives would only effect us is a positive way.

Lastly another adavantage would be less deaths due to car accidents. So many people die every year from recklace drivers or people driving under the infulence, limiting car usage would drop these numbers down drasically and make life for us way safer.

All these little advantages would make such a big outcome to everyday life as we know it, it would make our lives better in every outlook.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
950CC043A3DB,"When people hear about banning or limiting car use they would think that's crazy. Why would the govenment ban car use? Why would anyone vote for cars use to be banned or limited? Most people ask these questions because they don't know how they would get to work or go to the store. But there are many ways to get from one place to another.

One reason to limit or ban car use is because of greenhouse gases.""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""(In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, paragraph 5) Most peple that live in heavily populated areas know what smog is and how bad it gets. Greenhouse gases are really bad fot the environment and for us. Paris is one of the cities with this problem. ""[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussel and 79.7 in London...""(Paris bans driving due to smog, paragraph 17)

Another reason to limit car use is because too many people are driving and it causes stress.""""It's a good opportunity to take away stressand lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos... as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.""(Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Botogta, paragraph 24) In colombia millions hiked, biked skated or took buses to work during car free day leaving streets with no traffic jams. """"When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,""... media trainer and mother of two..""

When people can't use cars they dont want to walk all the way to a store that maybe 5 or more miles away. But accordint to In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, "" In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.""(paragraph 6) In Paris, on the days people couldn't use cars, ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday..."" if the public transportation was free then on the days we don't use cars the same could apply here.

The main reason for limiting car use is toreduce the amout of greenhouse gases. It's not that bad of an idea if you think about it. Cars wouldn't be banned forever just on certain days or untill the smog lightenes up. If Paris and Colombia and Cali and Valledupar are doing it we should too. Let's make the world a cleaner place because we only have one.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Life with no cars are spreading to places such as, Germany, and Bogota. People will tell you how great their lifes have been without the usage of a car.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Said Heidrun Walter mother of 2, who lives in the Vauban's community. The Vauban community in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe. Bogota, Colombia have limited their car usage as well. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car free-day they have in Bogota. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode his bike to work. They've even had people come to watch the event. Like the mayor of Paraguay who said, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.""

""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shif,"" said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Dexel University. Now a days people don't need to drive somewhere to go meet people. They just use the internet, and the use of cell phones have increased in communicating with people. With these changes, people who have stopped car commuting in the United States, may find less reason to resume the habit. But in places such as New York, with new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tools reflect these new priorities. ""Pedestrian, bicyle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emmissions and improve safety.""

In conclusion, life with no cars would be beneficial. You'll be provided with better safety, and wont be as tense and alot happier than you were before. You'll be able to see what life is really all about. A better life.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
9371586F4E86,"A car is considered by many a nessecity for everyday life; however, limited usage of our cars has many positive advantages. Emissions from cars create greenhouse gasses, which are detrimental to our enviroment, and limiting the use of our cars can greatly cut down these emissions. Also, many people say that using alternant modes of transportation cut down on the stress they expireinced whilst using a car. In fact, many people are no longer conserned with cars, and young people are begining to stop getting liscenses.

The smog, which is caused by car emissions, in Paris, France was so intense that the city had to place a partial ban on drivers. Those with even number plates faced a fine if they drove on Monday; and, on Tuesday those ith odd number plates would face the same fine if they drove. The ban was so successful in cutting down the smog that the ban was lifted in time for those with odd number plates to drive unrestricted on Tuesday.( source 2) Paris isn't the only city to place bans on driving, in Bogota, Columbia one day a year the city celebrates the 'Day Without Cars'. The idea of this day is to help reduce smog and has even caught on in Cali and Valledupar, also in Columbia.( source 3)

Vauban, Germany makes owning a car unappealing to residents by only allowing two places to park and creating a city plan that facilitates alternative modes of transportation. Many of the residents as a result dont own cars and are happier this way! ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,"" said resident Heidrun Walter. Cities like Vauban are result of a growing trend in Europe called smart planning, which seprates auto use from suburban life.(source 1) People all around the world also feel positive after limited car use. During the Day Without Cars in Columbia Carlos Arturo Plaza states that the day is "" A good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (source 3)

In 2013 the average miles driven per American was down 9% from the peak of car usage. This may because the Internet allow people to feel connected or possibly because many center cities renewal have made the suburbs less appealing. Whatever the reason, one things for sure, there has been a substancial drop in the amount of 16- to 39-year- olds getting a liscence. (source 4) America isnt the only place to expierence a drop in car usage. Vauban, Germany makes owning a car impractical and 57% of families sold their cars to live there, while 70% dont own cars. (source 1)

Limiting car usage has positive effects on the enviroment and has shown effective at lowering stress in people. Globally many are already starting to realize adavantages of cutting back on car usage. So while a car may seem like a nessecity, keep the advantages in mind.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
45E160AE8476,"Have you ever wondered what are the advantages of limiting car usage? Here are a few advantages that have actually helped in the real world, Less Smog, More stores in walking distance.

The first advantage was less smog. In Paris there was typically more smog than other European capitals. On mondays people were ordered to leave their cars at home or get fined a 22 euro fine ($31). It says in source 2 ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital, after five days of intensifying smog."" That quote right there shows that with people using their cars less there wouldnt be as much traffic as there was in the past and it has lessened the polution that was in the air. It says ""Exceptions were made for plug-in cars,hybrids,and cars carrying three or more passengers"", This was probably more enviormental friendly because those cars dont really use diesel fuel as apposed to the regular cars. As a result of all of that the smog cleared enough monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for tuesday.

The second advantageof limiting car usage is it makes peoples lives a little more easier. For example, Now there is less space for parking and more space for stores to be placed a walk away, On a main street, rather then in malls along a distant highway.

In conclusion the advantages of limiting your car usage helped reduce smog, and make peoples life easier by reducing green house gasses and creating less space for parking and making more space for stores to be placed a walk away, on a main street rather than in malls along a distant highway.

CB0F10A7C73C,"There are quite a few advantages in limiting car usage. You may think thats a very silly idea but honestly you have no idea. lets look at the bright side of this. If we limit car usage there will be less money waste, because you wont have to worry about spending your money on gas. Instead you can use it for something more valuable. Also in the article they mention this...""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden inthis experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders."" They dont really even use the cars so why have them if to some people in French they are useless.

Also as a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here.""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainerand mother of two. So now i know that not everyone needs a car most people dont. They think that us having only taxi's and busses things would be a better community and society to us, but i disagree. We wouldn't be able to get from one place to another as fast as we can, because of how there are people going everywhere to different places. So im glad we dont have only busses and taxi's.

""In the United States, the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduce"" communities, and legislators are starting to act,if cautiosuly. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. Can yall believe that for the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. Meaning they are for getting rid of cars. Also as of Apirl 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995, Part of the explination is because Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemplyed weren't going to work anyway.

New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation. Also ""a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...""thats crazy to think about that now we are in 2014 and i believe that number has most likely gone up. We need to fix it as soon as we can to prevent harm to our sociecty, because the younger ones have more reckless drivers than the older ones, and adults.

Finally, those are my reason and my explinations on why i think cars should stop because of the harm to our community and how we should start using bikes or even walk from point a to point be,or use the busses either one will safe us the gas mopney for example. Also it would prevent less deaths because there wouldn't be so many cars all together at once    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F5CAB2C4A8F3,"Today there are many reasons why we should and should not have car. One of the main reasons is air polution so many people are bying cars and all these cars are creating all this polution. The United States Enviromental protection agency is promotting cars to be reduced. After near record polution, Paris baned driving to clear some of the air. I do believe cars cause a huge disavantage to our clean air but i do not agree with banning people from driving gassed cars, But It would be better for the environment if people would start buying electric cars (hybrid) because some dont run off of gas and some use very little gas. Using these electric cars will benifit everyone because it cost less instead of buying gas and it leaves cleaner air in our environment. Even if lets say forty percent of United States citizens used electric cars that would still leave a huge roll in having cleaner air for us to breath, But if we all do switch to electric cars then cities need to provide cargers for cars like this so that if we are out for a while and our cars battery dies we can charge the car, I think people dont use these cars as much because they think well what happenes if my cars battery dies then there screwed. So i believe if they came out with chargers and bigger cars for families then more people would want to participate in joining an electric car, Because this wont just be saving them money this is also saving some of the air that we breath.

This is our society today. Some people think that this issue is not a big deal, but in fact it is. But where is all this polution coming from? The answer is simple, cars! Cars are the second leading poluter, in America. What these cars are doing are releasing a poisonous smog into the atmosphere, and we breathe it. Its not only killing us though, oh no. It is killing our one, our only, Earth. We are killing the only thing the human race has to live on, and for what? So we can save a couple minutes to get to work? This needs to stop. Why continue to use cars when thier are so many more advantages not to use them? Without cars, or limiting the number of car usage we would save billions of dollars a year, be much more further into technology, and not only be saving lives, but saving our Earth.

How much money would you say you spend on gas a week? Doesn't seem like all that much right? Now add the same thing again, and again, and again. By now you are probably in the hundreds. Now picture yourself with all of that in your hand. Thats all the money you have spent on something that is gone in almost an instant. Think about all the things you could buy with that money. Sounds nice right? Well why don't you just make it a reality than? You could save hundreds in hundreds of dollars in as little as one month! You could save even more by not even buying a car! than you'd be saving a ton of money. Plus youd be doing yourself a favor. You dont need to pay for gas, insurance, repairs or even the car. This is what people in not only America are doing but also in Columbia,  Bogota, and one of the worlds most beautiful cities in the world, Paris. These people are bettering themselves, and thier country.

""All of our world development since world war II has been sentered on the car""

said David Goldberg in the article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars . Just think about how much more advanced of a society we could have without cars. So many things could be created that could save lives! A cure for cancer, a solution to end world hunger, new electronics, maybe even ways to reach past the ridges of our galaxy, yet somehow we still put our focus on something that is killing us, and the Earth. Sure theres some cool tech in these new Automobils but, the only reason people by cars are for new features, or better mpg, or as said by Mr. Sivak in

The End of Car Culture ,

""A car is just a means of getting from A to B"", but thats all people really buy new cars, or use them for. If we wernt so focused on cars we would have new, and improved technology, and a lot more life changing discoveries.

The Earth is dying. We are killing it, and ourselves. How much gasoline can your tank hold? the real question is how much gasoline can we put into the air we breathe? This smog and polution is destroying some of the most beautiful scenes on earth. Paris, New York, and Bejing. However the usage of these automobils are not only killing us with polution, but with auto accidents. So many of Americans have lost thier lives due to wrecks, crashes, common stupidity, and deffects in the car itself. Whats even more sad is a lot of the time the person who has lost thier life is not even at fault. A lot of times when driving people tend to get stressed out. road rage is a dangerous thing. In fact Heidrun Walter exclaimed his opinion on the subject by saying ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" in the article

Together we can acomplish this! we would have the advantages of saving billions of dollars a year to use for bigger and better things, be much more further into technology, and not only be saving lives, but saving our Earth, on our side.

67780BCAD15F,"Cars are an integral part of many peoples' lives around the world: they provide transportation to work and home, they cater to social lives, and for some they even provide a home.

However, it's becoming a trend to limit car usage, particularly in Europe. Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up cars almost completely, with the exception of a $40,000 parking garage fee that over half of the residents have elected not to use.

While it may make getting places harder, the effects of cutting down on car usage are mostly good ones.

First and foremost on this list is global warming. In Europe, cars produce around twelve percent of greenhouse emmissions, while in the US, the number can be as high as fifty percent in cities. This is not good. Global warming is destroying the ice caps and the ozone layer of Earth, leading to a temperature increase that is damaging many enviornments around the world. This, in addition to pollution released by cars and the oil industry, could permanantly cripple our planet. Any way that we can cut the effects of global warming should be implemented.

Secondly, crowded cities benefit in many ways from a lessening of driving. Some cities, like Paris, have already had to enact a partial ban on driving due to a heavy smog layer. Other cities, like Beijing, is even more polluted, and cities in this country suffer as well. If less people drove, the air would be clearer, as was the case in Paris.

Also, there is less crowding when less people are driving. Anyone who has driven through or lived in a large city knows just how bad congestion and traffic jams can be. Less driving would mean less congestion, making it easier for people to get to work, school, or other locations on time. When Paris enacted its driving ban of those with even-numbered liscence plates, congestion went down sixty percent.

Finally, using an alternative to cars can save money. Public transportation could be expensive and, frankly, overcrowded, but it provi             ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
3EFE95094B2C,"For many years people have been using cars to get around to do their important tasks.  The stress every indivdual has to go through just to make it through the day could be difficult. It is better if we create a car free world. Just picture you waking up in the morning peacefully without the sounds of car motors turning on or the smell of smoke in the air. With the reduction of cars, the planet would be a healthier and safer place to live on.

Limiting car usage can have a numerous amount of advantages to citizens. With all the issues every country has, the most important one is the emisson of green house gases. With the use of less cars, the green house gas percentage rate will go down significantly. In source 3 it says ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" As this event starts to happen the Earths atmosphere will start to recover and there would be less traffic on the roads. In source 3, Bogota Colombia has a program named the ""Day Without Cars."" This program has a goal to promote another way of transporation to the people and to reduce smog in their capital city. While it on their third year, ""people are generating a revoluntionary change..."" said Enrique Riera. Since this event is becoming more sucessfull parks and sports centers have been used more throughout the city. In soruce 2, Pari has a situation of smog too. They decided to created a ""partial driving ban"" which allowed the air to be cleared in Paris but also fined 4,000 drivers with the cost of 22-euros ($31) or impounded cars for their ""reaction of the fine.""

Another advantage ciztens have to limiting car usage is that it lowers the cost of indivdual of paying their car bills and the amount of gas which is really high. With other types transportation like public buses, walking or riding a bicycle this effort helps to conserve resources that are about to disappear since we use them too much and it improves our safety with the reduction of having car accidents due to traffic jams. In source 1 Vauban, Germany their is a community that has 5,500 resident that do not own a car. This community restricts car into their streets. This communtiy is a ""low-car suburban life"" that has a wallkway,stores on the main street and some distant highways with the help of public transportation.

As we continue our effort into establishing a ""car free"" community it will benefit us in the future. While we reduced the percentage of green house gases in the air then the government will not have to worry about one problem and move to something that needs to be fixed right away. All the taxes we've have beeen paying will to crisis outside of our country. If we expand these no car communties that Colombia and Germany have then there will be a ""shift in American behavior"" source 4 states. Americans love cars but as the years passed by from ""2005-2013 the miles driven per persons have slowly decereased 9 percent."" Hopefully,as the next few year it will make a difference.

Even though us humans love cars their is a limit into how much we should use them. But as we grow we will have a healthier and dafer planet to live on, spend less moeny on cars and more money on important nessesites, and it woyukd create a better future for our children an their families.                                                                    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B5F54C170E16,"Think of this, ""car-free cities"". To about 90 percent of Americans this idea may sound outrageously retarded. why? well, for those who own a car their car is extremely important to them because it's their form of transportation, but also think of the harm that cars have done in just the past decades. Our global warming levels have rose dramatically and cars are one of the so many reasons. Not just that, think of all the deaths that have been involved with car accidents. All this can be stopped if we learn how to manage our car usage.

I'm not saying that cars should be banned or not used at all in our country, but we most definitely do need to be less dependent on our cars. Some places have already started the movement of car-free cities like in VAUBAN, Germany. They have given up their cars and have adjusted to a whole new life style. In the article ""car-free cities"" paragraph 3, a women named Heidrun Walter shares her opinion. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Not only can it be beneficial, but some people actually like the idea.

Now lets think of air pollution that has rose our global warming levels. If you were to ask someone ""what's the biggest reason for global warming""? The first thing that would come to mind to almost everyone would be air pollution caused by cars. This isn't just in the US, this is going on everywhere in the world, but some places are finding solutions for this problem. For example, in the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" paragraph 1, it says ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". That's a perfect example of limiting car usage that can be extremely beneficial to us and our earth.

Some people may ask, ""how can you limit your car usage"" Well, you can ride your bike to work, take public transportation, and also walk. Riding your bike to work or walking to where you need to go can be an advantage to yourself. Many Americans are so inactive due to their cars because it can take you anywhere, but if you go out and walk or ride a bike to where you're going you're helping yourself out, and no it's not like you have to do it every day, but its just a way that we can manage our car usage and it would be more helpful than you think.

If we all take that big step and want to make a difference to our earth and its air pollution, we can achieve it. We don't necessarily have to be ""car-free"" we just all have to learn how to manage our car usage to make the big help. There would be less air pollution, our global warming levels would drop, there could be less car accidents, and less deaths. These advantages of limiting our car usage could just about save our lives and our earth.     ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Limiting cars will not only benefit us with the idea of air pollution but with obesity, and obesity is a big thing in the United States. Its amazing how may people care about there enviornment. In source 3, Bogota, Colombia millions of columbians hike, bike, skate, or took buses to work during a day they call car-free day because they want to reduce air pollution.

In the United States one out of every 4 person is obese, and the reduction of car usage will help limit the obesity rate. Walking or even biking from one place to another is a work out and that is a common way to lose weight. We try so hard to reduce obesity and one of the many ways to gain weight is to eat junk food and not jog, run, or walk it off. So reducing the limit of cars is a good idea to reduce the obesity rate in the United States.

The reduction of cars will help the air polluting situation in the U.S. The pollution in the air will later in the future bit us right on the rear end. Many people may believe its happening now. The main cause of air pollution is the fuel we have running on our cars that are on the road 24/7. If we limit the usage of cars now we will start to see the difference in our world today.

Many people dont really use cars in the United States in source 4 it states that study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between the years of 2001 and 2009. It also stated that in 2005 the number of miles driven dropped steadily. Each year in America people are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by a recent studies found. So believe or not not many people don't need a car to get to point A to point B.

As of today we should make a effort to stop using our cars and maybe walk to work and get your exercise for the day while doing it. Let make a change together and stop the mass of air pollution we have going on and and reduce the rate of obesity.

There are many advantages to giving up our little priveledge to ride around; If we as a community were to give up having cars we would have less pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emmision and our communities would improve rapidly. We need to give up cars to form a better more safe environment for our families.

First off, an advantage to limiting car usage would be less pollution in our areas. ""Cold nights and warms days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emmision""(Duffer 15). ""In source 2 ""Paris bans drving due to smog"" it also shows that becuase of the enourmous amount of smog from cars they had to ban driving. After just 5 days of no car usage, the amount of pollution was down 60 percent. We as a people have to realize how drastic that change is. All we have to do to help the environment and nature grow more efficiently is to not use our cars as often.

Another advantage to lessoning our use in automobiles is the reduction of green house gas emmision. ""...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe...""(Rosenthal 5). There our many programs and agencys trying to reduce greenhouse affects; such as the one above, by banning the use of cars; one being the Environmental Protection Agency. President Obama is also trying to curb the United States greenhouse gas emmisions as shown in source 4 ""the End of Car Culture."" David Goldberg, an official of the Transportaion of America says ""All of our development since World War 11 has been centered on the car...""(Rosenthal 7). We as a people are so induldged with cars and how efficent they may be in some aspects we dont realize the harm its doing to our communities.

Lastly an advantage to the limitations of car usage, is our communities improving rapidly. An example of this is The day without cars improvement campaign in Colombia, shown in source 3. During this day people that  lived in those areas would have to ride a bike, hike, take a bus or walk to work or scool. Becuase of this there was no traffic jams and parks and sports centers bloomed. Also, becuase so many were envovled in this, the sidewalks and streets were improved and new restaurants and shopping centers were developing.

In all, The effects of limiting car usage would cause less pollution, lesson the amount of greenhouse gas emmision and cause our communities to improve rapidly.

DA8115F12B50,"Everyday a great many people drive their cars to commute to work, run errands, and sometimes drive their cars for career related purposes. Little do they know that the greenhouse gas emissions that their automobiles create are damaging the environment and creating large amounts of pollution in metropolitan areas. To help reduce the gas emmisions caused by automobiles many countries around the world have created programs and communities that are designed to lessen the amount of car usage in the areas that they are employed in. In doing so they have reduced the amount of greenhouse gasses in Earth's atmosphere along with producing many other benefits.

Of all the advantages of limited car usage the most attractive one would definetly have to be reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Not only will people save money on fuel in communities that forbid the usage of cars but they will save the planet as well. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhous gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" The information shows that a large amount of gas emissions can be produced by automobiles. Assume that there were a lot of cities that had incredibly low rates of car usage. If those city's greenhose gas emission levels were compared to those of an average car filled city then it would be logical that the car-free city produced less greenhouse gasses.

Another positive change that has the ability to happen in cities and communities that limit their car usage is that municipal development can occur. When people start to use cars less and less then businesses would most likely move to more accessable locations which in turn may give the businesses more customers. Due to the increased business in certain stores, stores from different companies will likely move in to areas in and around the one the other businesses reside in to drum up their sales as well. The article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" supports my statement in the with the sentence, ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" The sentence shows the correlation between lessening car usage and municipal development.

Kids could be walking in the street, not paying attention to anything but themselves, and get hit. That can't happen if their city limits car usage! Limiting car usage saves lives! You could walk more safely, without having to worry if the driver is stupid and going to hit you!

Another reason limiting car usuage is good is, Drunk Drivers. If you limit car usage, Drunk Drivers are limited as well, decreasing accidents, deaths, etc. We all know that less Drunk Drivers = a safe community. No one wants to be a victim of a drunk driver accident.

To conclude, these are my reasons for why I think limiting car usuage is good. It decreases pollution, decreases accidents with kids getting hit, and limits deaths from drunk drivng. Thank you for reading this essay.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
2BF3D1830865,"Elisabeth Rosenthal once asked, ""Has America passed peak driving?"", (30) having people go out of their way to think about the inquirable question. There are plenty of advantages of limiting car usage. America, nor any other country on this planet, really need cars. Sure, cars help us to get to a location faster than walking or biking. But it also smogs up the environment we live in and creates a stressful tension within you.

In Source 2, Paris, one of the world's most famous sightseeing locations on this planet, was days of near-record pollution. Paris strictly enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. (10) For almost a week, there was an intensified amount of smog roaming the streets of Paris. Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France. (14) This smog was causing frigid nights and warm days the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. (15) Not only was there smog in Paris, but also rivaled one of the most polluted cities in the world, Beijing, China. Paris decided to particially cut down motorists chances of driving and leave their cars at home or would have had to suffer a fine. This well-known city was car-free for almost an entire week.

In line with Source 2, Source 3 explains multiple ways of transportation. Why drive cars and pollute the air, if there are plenty of other ways to getting to your destination. Bogota, Colombia has set up a program that is set to spread to other countries. This program consist of having a car-free day once a year for the last 3 years, Day Without Cars day. More than 6 million of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses and taxis to work, Bogota's streets were traffic-jam-free.(20) ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman. (24) No stress was within the city of Bogota that day. Their goal is to promote better transportation and reduce smog. (21)

Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, noticed the enthusiastic changes being made and said, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" (26) Fellow citizens, their are several advantages of limiting car usage. Maybe the next time you think about going somwhere, try taking a bike or walking. It's easier and reliefs stress among yourself. Plus, when not driving a car, you're able to decrease the amount of pollution being put into the air.           ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D09CE06B96D1,"Limiting car usage would have many benefits for the environment.  Pollution in large cities would be reduced, greenhouse gas emissions would be lower, and noise pollution would be lower.  The simple act of of using alternative transportation would help the environment greatly.

Cities like Bejing, in China, are heavily polluted by emissions from motor vehicles.  This has negative effects on people's health and the environment.  Another point to be made is that if fewer people are driving cars then you won't have to see cars parked all over your city.  But this is America, not Europe; we like our cars here.  I couldn't stand not being able to drive my Ford Mustang GT whenever i feel like it. That is the problem, people will not want to give up driving their cars. I can relate to that.  It is true that driving less will protect our environment, which is very important, but many people will not give up driving.

The real reason why Americans are not buying cars and getting licenses is because of our current recession.  Most people can not afford to have a car, pay insurance, and pay for fuel, especially young people.  No matter what, people are going to keep on driving; Yes, this is off topic, but I don't reallty care for the topic.  So here I'll say: Until the day I die I will keep on driving; driving cars is part of American culture, It will not be relenquished by all.  The answer to protecting the environment needs to be finding a more environment friendly fuel source without turning my Mustang into a Prius.

Who would want to see penguins fall into the water because the land they live on has melted? I do, but still it is not right. Cars make animals all over the world fall into the water because the land they are on is melting. One time i saw a history show that showed the ice melting and falling onto the sea.

Cars are soo bulky and they have alot of mass. Thats right, I said it ! MASS! They make it harder to walk on the road. It looks like they are so big too!

Also they dont need gasoline or electricity, they just need oatmeal or beans. Sometimes my horse eats its own feces also, which makes feeding it less of a hassle. (Source 2)

Last but leastly, cars are sooo freeckin expensive. Back in the days, cars used to cost like 500 dollars. (Source 5)Now they cost 5000 dollars for a used one. That is soo lame! Also, you have to pay alot of money. Sometimes you pay more money than the cost of your house. Now if you live in Lebron's house, that is ridiculous. Yes i like basketball by the way! Basketball cars cost the most money too.(Source 4) If you have seen limited edition sports cars, they cost up to 30,000! Who has the money for that kind of reckless spending.

B0153737CC59,"Today in the recent years car usages rates has been sky rocketing. ""All of our developement since World war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"", said David Goldberg. Ever since the gas emissions has been causing problems and polluting the air, and causing smogs. Like in Beijing, China, and other European capitals. It is also almost 50% of the green house gas emissions in Europe in car-intensive area in like the United states!

There can be a solution to this situation..... Car free days! While of the exception of plug-in cars. This helps promote alternative transportation and reduce Smog and a polluted atmosphere. ""Public transportation was free of charge from Friday to Monday"", ""The smog cleared enough on Monday"" said BBC.

Or automobiles can be banned completely. Like in the Suburbs Vauban families do not own cars and 57% of families sold their car to move in Vauban. Drive ways and home garages are forbidden generally. By this action stores are placed walking distances rather than a long distance like a highway. Cars can be allowed but only can park in only to places, large parking garages and where a car owner buys a space of $40,000 with there payment of a house! Thats a lot of money.

It is your choice would you rather be fine $40,000 for a parking space along with your house. Be fined every time you decide not to take part in the car free day to help pollution from car emissions. Or do the right thing for you,your family,your kids and your world. To help decrease the usage of automobiles. Lower the stress and air emissions.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
DFB0802421E9,"Pollution

The cars in the world have created a serious problem of polution or also known as smog. In places like U.S and Europe states are trying to get citezens to stop using car on a every day basis and maybe use a bus or any other means of transportion to stop spreading smog.

Vauban,Germany is one place where citezens have to live withought a car. It is one place where cars are not allowed but if you really want one you have to buy a large garage worth $40,000 and buy a house. Which is the reason many of the residents dont have a car there and if they were to travel they travel by bike or any other eco-friendly transportion. Which would help enhance the look of the city and have you save gas money for a day or so.

In Paris,France they had banned cars for a few days till all the smug in the city is gone. People had to use plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers were aloud. Publick transportation was free of charge from Friday to Monday. Alot of smog had cleared up by Monday for the French party to rescind the ban od cars on Tuesday.

Bogota,Colombis had their third straight year ban of cars. With only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital of 7 milion. Their goal was to have the citezens use more public transportion and reduce smog in Bogota. And because of that cause two more cities in colomia named Cali and Valledupar joined the Day Without Cars event.

In U.S lately since 2005 the car sales have been going down and down and the ownership rate of the typical has gone down at a fast pace. Expets in university of Michigan's Transportion Research Institute belice that there is somethign more fundamental going on in U.S. Many sociologists belive it will have a beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviorment, since transportion is the second largest source of America's emissions. Even in NewYork there has been more bicycle sharing and subway transportion to help get rid of the smog in the city created by millions of cars in the city.

People have been learning to help the earth by stopping the transportion of cars which has been becoming less and less of a issue so if more states and cites were to join together in lowering the usage of cars and maybe more sco-friendly transportion then maybe we could enhance our image of the earth from global warming. By using the public transportion given or just getting a hybrid car.            ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
19C3217F89AF,"People all over the world are saying goodbye to their cars and saying hello to different, old-fashioned ways of transportation. This new trend involves walking, bike riding, and other types of public transportation. Certain cities, like Vauban and Paris, have started to set limitations on car usage. These limitations include days where cars with specific license plates' are not allowed to drive that day or even complete days where no driving is allowed, failure to follow these rules results in a fine. Most citizens of these towns have been following these rules and have found to be quite rewarding. These advantages include stress relief and a happier attitude, less greenhouse emission into the atomosphere, and a overall better environment. Limiting car usage is more beneficial than it is negative.

One of the most beneficial parts of not using a car often would be the loss of stress and a increase in a happy attitude. Most people who have participated in the limitation of car use have had positive feed back. One woman in Vauban, Germany, where most citizens are giving up their cars, said ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" (Rosenthal, 3). Another man in Bogota, Colombia participating in their car-free day said ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress...' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife."" (Selsky, 24). All around people who have joined this trend have started to become happier and less stressed as the start to leave their cars behind.

Another advantage of limiting car usage would be less greenhouse emission into the atomosphere. Cars play a huge part in greenhouse emission into the atomosphere, so limiting the usage would have such a positive result. According the the article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive ares in the United States."" (Rosenthal, 5). Knowing that, cutting out cars would minimize the greenhouse gas emission a huge percent in certain regions, like the United States. The article

The End of Car Culture discusses how the amount of people who own cars keeps getting progressively lower each year, which will help with greenhouse emission. After discussing statistics of the amount of people who own cars in America, the article goese on to say, ""If this pattern persists - and many sociologoists believe it will - it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest sourse of America's emissions..."" (Rosenthal, 34). With limiting the amount of car usage the atmosphere will be exposed to a lot less greenhouse emission.

One huge advantage of limiting the usage of cars would be a overall better environment. Many cities are so polluted and have air filled with smog, like Beijing and Paris. Some of this smog comes from cars. Paris is doing something to stop their smog from becoming any worse, they are banning driving. ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" (Duffer, 11). A similar situation is happening in Bogota, Columbia. Bogota started a car-free day to help with their situation. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" (Selsky, 21). These new limitations on car usage are going to help save the environment.

Overall, the limitations that are being put on car usage have many advantages. The lack of car usage in certain areas is helping to create a better environment, give out less greenhouse emission, and give people a happy attitude. Putting limitations on car usage has benefited many areas and continues to benefit them now. Most of these places are continuing to progress and put more limitations on cars as they head into a nicer, brighter future.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
9A95F4DC5098,"Limiting car usage would be great for people in a big city, not so much the country. It would be good for people in the city because everything is right beside each other and if it wasn't you can have taxis so it saves gas. Its also good to cut down on car usage because it will make us healthier. If we don't drive all the time its better for the environment.

The first reason for cutting back on car usage is because everything is right beside each other in a city. There is no reason to waste the gas to drive right down the road. In the country its different because it may be a small town yes, but everything may be 15 to 20 miles away. And we don't have taxi's or buses.

Have you ever thought about walking everyday to school or work? Everybody would be in great shape! We would walk everywhere and if you're running late then you will most likely fast walk which is even better. People would start eating better because they would get cramps walking to work, they would start exercising more. Even if they didn't like walking to school or work they would have to so they wouldn't have a choice but to exercise.

We harm the environment everyday with the cars we drive. Why not just stop using cars so we can help our planet and maybe make it a better place to live? All it would take is you walking a couple blocks to school, work, or the store and that would already be helping us.

The thing is people today are so selfish and take everything for garnet. The things we could accomplish if we only cut back a little bit. Just save gas, if you are going to the store that is two blocks away, don't call a taxi, don't crank your car up, just walk there. People would be so much healthier if they walked everyday, and we would help the environment. I'm not telling you to start being a tree huger or anything, just think about it. Would you rather live in a polluted environment or a healthy one? The choice is yours.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
16585724607E,"Are we using cars too much?

In Source 2 : Paris bans driving due to smog , "" After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Because that we use cars too much, we are creating pollution that is basically driving the planet we live on downhill. There is a way to change this. Limiting car usage, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

Life can go on without cars. In VAUBAN,Germany a community has created a car-free city. The streets are completely car free. This is an experimental new district that is seeing if excluding cars can life become better not only physically but also mentally. Many people driving on the roads daily tend to have more stress from overcrowding streets, noise, and most of all crashes. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move to here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much pappier this way,"" said heidrun Walter."" (Source 1,3) From this evidence it shows that life without a car can actually have a better impact on a person.

Another advantage to limiting car usage is it reduces pollution. Paris enforced a driving ban to clear smog from the global city after a near record pollution. From this ban alomst 4,000 drivers were fined, and some even had their cars impunded due to their reactions from the fines. But these fines and bans came out with a positive effect in the end. Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France, just after a few days of putting the ban into effect. The smog cleared enough for the French ruling party to rescind the ban for certain days.

Has America's love for cars already started cooling? Or has technology taken the reason why we should drive away? Elisabeth Rosenthal states that , "" the interent makes telecommuting possibole and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. the renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the riswe in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" (source 4, 35) I believe that since technology has evolved that people dont feel the need to leave home to meet friends when they can just use apps or call,text,facetime,etc.

These reasons I showed make me believe that limitng car usage can create positive advantages, I hope they make you feel the same way too.                                               ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

There is less air polution. The biggest thing is smog.

Smog is a very big consern in todays socity. After days of near record pollution, paris enforced a partial ban to clear the air of the global city. With no vehicles on the road, that means no smog. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after 5 days of intensifying smog. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in france, compared to a 53.3 percent average of deiselengines in the rest of western Europe, according to reuters. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug in cars, hybrids, and cars carring three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from friday to monday, according to the bbc.

Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in europe, the united states and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called smart planning.""All of our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, and official of transportation America.

Most people would freak out if they had to loose there vehicles. But if you look at it the way these people do then it wouldnt be that bad. Smog is hurting the world all over. There would be less car accidents. And there would be less gas and oil sources being used. It helps the world and some people said that it makes them happeir and they arent usually as sterssed or mad ever sence the got rid of there cars.         ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

FC8DD899209B,"Imagine the world in the future, completely full and covered with cars. Roads are going to start taking up every area of Earth, if people continue driving everywhere and buying cars. I think people should limit car usage because it's environmental friendly, they'll get more exercise, and people will be happier. Cars can be handy from time to time, but i think they should only be used occasionally. Imagine if there was a car for everyone on the planet. Car usage should decrease.

First of all, the Earth is beautiful and the people on it need to take better care of it. For example, just one day without the use of cars in a city, allowed them to construct bike paths, new sidewalks, and reduced traffic jams. Fuel from cars will polute the air and cause smog. If everyone continues to use cars as much as they do or more, there will be no way to clean all the air. When Paris banned cars for a while, smog was cleared and reduced by a lot. Limiting car use will not save the Earth completely, but it will help very much.

Secondly, if people started using cars less, they could get outside more and get more exercise. Biking will help people get fresh air and decrease pollution because cars won't be used as much. People should start finding jobs or doing activties that are close enough to walk or bike to. Cars are for situations in which you really have no other way there or long distances. That's all I think they should be used for. Everyone would be much more fit and healthy if it weren't for being lazy and having to take a car there.

Lastly, not using cars could increase people's happiness. Some people suggest that having a car makes them tense. Everyone would become much closer together and explore more of the world without cars. We could all be outdoors or around each other more. For example, you could take the bus to work instead of your car and meet a new friend. You never know what could happen when you try something new. It's good to change things up once in a while, like not taking your car every now and then and finding another way there.

In conclusion, the positives definetely outnumber the negatives of limiting car use. The main three reasons in my opinion is that it's environmental friendly, you'll get more exercise, and you'll most likely be much happier. Think about all the good outcomes that could come out of not driving your car and try it sometime.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
1D0E0C228813,"Ever wondered how the streets of a very popullated city would look like? For example, Miami. At night Miami is full buildings that stand out in color, and on the highways you can see a whole road full of lights, the thing with these lights is that they are cars, even though they are helpful by getting us from point A to point B, they are the second highest source of pollution in the United States, that is after power plants. The only thing a city like Miami is missing at night is a sky full of bright stars, which that can be done by people not driving to everywhere they go, even if it is one or two blocks away. This whole ""car-free"" thing is become more and more popular all over the world.

In Vauban, Germany a small town, home to 5,500 people have decided to go car-free. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"" (Source 1). 70 percent of the the people is a lot, these streets are completly car-free except in the main thoroughfare and on the edge of the community, if this were to happen to a larger city the nights would be beatiful, and so will the days because you have all the car noise out and instead you have people talking and kids running all around the streets. ""Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Souce 1). Miami is a car-intensive area, I know this from personal experince, there is always traffic during the day. I've been to other places in Florida, not that far from Miami, in Palm Beach at night the amount of starts you see at nights is beautiful and it's something new to see other than in Miami you see 2 to 3 stars. My point here isn't stars, it's how much better the world can be if we all do what this small town in Germany is doing.

Paris, France. The city of lights home to millions of residents and a landmark for millions of tourists, one would think this city couldn't run without cars, but they made it happen. Paris wanted to clean all the air polution in their city, ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)"" (Source 2). Even though some didn't listen and about 4,000 drivers were fined, that is still very little compared to the entire population of Paris. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog"" (Source 2). Can you believe that? Traffic was down by 60 perfect in the city of lights, if it can happen there it can happen all around the world, little by little bu we'll get it. Public transportation was free of charge in the city while this car-free thing was going on. One week later the smog had cleared out enough for the ruiling French party to rescind the ban.

""BOGOTA, Colombia - In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Source 3). Yes, the city of Bogota in Colombia had its one car-free day, in Bogota called ""Day Without Cars"", this was the third year actually, on this ""car-free"" day cars are banned and only buses and taxis are permitted for the day. Bogota was not the only Colombian city to participate in this event, other Colombian cities like Cali and Valledupr, participated in this event for the first time. I find it funny and ironic because my sister has a friend who is Colombian and she owns a bicycle and she goes everywhere in that bicycle, and she refuses to get a car. Bogota is a very known city and just like I said before, if they can do it then the whole world can it. This day should be world wide and should be done at leats twice a year. Events like this will also get people motivated to start walking morre often. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Source 3). If you've ever been to Miami, you know the huge amount of building there are here and I think there are about 3 or 4 being built at I type, how about we stop there and make Miami and healthier and more environmentally friendly place.

In the United States, research shows ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" (Source 4). This meaning that adolescents aren't as intresting and driving as they were before, yeah I see how driving can be better but most kids here take the bus, they aren't even driven by their parents anymore. I find that this is a good thing because, one can ask themselves, I can't make a difference, but if thousands of people ask themselves that, then yes a difference can be made. In 2005 the miles driven by Americans peaked, and then steadily went dropping, in April, 2013 they found out that the miles in car was the same as it was in 1995. Not driving everywhere you go and actually walking there is a good thing because you can make new friends, and health wise it is also good because, instead of walking around your block for an hour, you can walk to someones house or to the store. There are several carpooling apps on the internet nowadays, if your friends can't pick you up, for just a push of a button you can have someone come pick you up to where ever you are and drop you off where you need to go to, for a low price. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (Source 4). This means that people aren't as interest in driving anymore, which means we are slowly getting near the time where we'll see more stars in the sky in car-intensive areas.               ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

The main advantage I noticed is the decrease in air pollution. Being able to produce smog across an entire city like Paris is impressive alone, but...after reading

Paragraph 17 in Source 2

(""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...""), I'm not all too surprised. Another thing I'm not surprised about are French delivery companies whining about not getting paid enough during the ban (

Paragraph 18, Source 2

). Guess what: It's just money, green sheets of decorated paper. Deal with it!

Also, I noticed that Bogota holds a ""Car-Free Day"" once a year. Honestly, I say ""Well played."" Treating it as an annual tradition is the right move to get a group of people, regardless of amount, to do something. It's been getting positive comments (

Paragraph 24, Source 3

), as well, which is a sign that it will last a long time. To sum it up, the second advantage is that it gives people the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors.

82858C701793,"Over the years cars have been known to be a very useful for transportation and to get people to their destination. But not everybody thinks cars should be used as much or at all, for many reasons. But there is only two main reasons why people disagree that cars are needed, that is pollution and people have less exercise. Because of these two reasons companies,programs and even President Obama are trying to reduce the use of cars. They are trying to figure out a way to help both the environment and peoples well being.

Pollution seems to be increasing over time because of cars. For that reason is why companies, programs and Obama are trying to decrease the use of cars. For example Obama has goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions to help the pollution go down. America has so much love for vehicles, but studies show that america's love affair with its cars has been decreasing. Year by year americans seem to buy buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences. Since 2005 the number of miles driven as dropped steadily.

Most people see cars as the easier and quicker way to get to where they want to get. Because of these reason is why people dont exercise and they are not has healthy and fit as they should be. Bogota, Columbia has a program that is set to spread to other countries. The program has made a car-free day where people dont use their cars all day. they either hike, ride a bike, skat, took buses and even walked to their destination. I honestly think that is a great program because I dont think people should always rely on there cars to get where they have to. doing all of these things helps people because that is healthier and it less pollution as well.

Next time you think about getting driving your car somewhere, think about how your going to increase the environments pollution. There are so many different ways to gets to your destination that are better for you and the environment you live in. There are great programs all around the United States that are trying to decrease the use vechicles which is slowly working as the year goes by. Next time you wanna go somewhere ride a bike , take a bus or even walk to where ever it is you want to go because people shouldnt be depending on their vechicles as much as they think.

As seen in paragraph 17, car emmisions arn't only destroying our enviroment, but are also polluting our air to the point where Paris was covered for days in complete smog. That is why biking, walking, running, conservative driving, etc are very needed in these days where everyone belives gas powered vehicles are our way of life. While people drive in cars constantly it creates more carbon emmisions destroying our air and environment, but on the other hand more biking causes less traffic build up, healthier, and more businesses open up in walking distance because of the magnitude of participants walking/biking.

To begin with, driving in cars isnt only extremely dangerous, it pollutes the air we all breathe! It makes our lungs become more weak and suseptible to disease and sickness. People may argue that giving up our most widely used transportation vehicle in the U.S. and very profitable vehicle industries, is too much. But I argue, that giving up something that will later in time completely destroy us and our earth is worth it. Pollution is a very serious problem that most people can't seeem to wrap their head around. It's a deadly chemicals and waste being put into our air we breathe every second, yet we chose our vehicles over our precious air?!

Next, understanding what more walking and less vehicular trnsportation can do for the world has amazing effects. Not only is it a healthy alternative to walk instead of driving because of our obseity issue here in America, but it cuts out pollution which hurts us and animals. More walking will create less traffic and more businesses and restaruants in walking distance, causing a better community and economy.

In conclusion, more walking and biking is a much better alternative to driving cars constantly. Communities come together more, less traffic, more safety, no road rage, etc. These are all things that could come from walking instead of driving in vehicles.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Smog is like a poison fog created by cars and things of that nature and is put into the atmosphere for people to breath into there lungs and is but into there body just beacuse they ""need"" to drive where they ""have""to go in such a hurry.

when you remove cars for an extended period of time or just the day people are forced into physical activity to relay on when they have to go places like the store, the mall, out to eat ect. its good for people just to get out and exercise instead of someone saying im going to the drug store that is a 5 min walk down the road. now its alot more reasonable if the place your going in like 5 miles from where you live then yes drive but if is 5 min walk just walk its not going to kill you. even if its just biking up the road to get the mail it still beats driving for no reason on somthing you could walk/bike to get.

If you remove cars once a week, evan once a year you could clean up the town/city you live in to bring new business to the town you live in and new busnisses means new jobs so that an econome increases in the town because it been cleaned up and new busniess has be created in your town.

By just reducing the amount of cars invarious locations the amount of space would increase the therefore make town or city more accessable for the large population. this change of culture may benifit the population by just having the public transportation and biking.

To begin with the space comsuming in suburbs makes it hard most people make a living in the tight area and having the certian parking areas may be the only way to have the space needed to get to where they need to be, yet its all timed. this makes people more tense when they had to worry of a parking spot. The people in Germany weren't allowed to park the sides of the road and have drive ways unless they payed an extra $40,000 along with a home. As said the text Vaban, had completed a trend of separating the car use from the surburban life, this is what they called the 'smart planning'. Aslo to include that other areas of the world such as Beijing, China, has to worry more the amount of smog polluting their air and making people ill. In Paris, France, diesel fuel was blamed for the pollution because most of the cars were made up of this fuel. they were rank the most polluted area comparedto other locations. Therefore to reduce the amount of the complaints of the lack of space and pollution the want to either rid of the cars or just buy more plug-in-cars and hybrids for cleaner air.

Not to mention, that in Bogota, Colombia they completely banned the cars from their country for a day to promote an alternative transportation and reduce the smog. the voilators are faced $25 fines. As said the text, the stress level has dropped and therefore has madeit easier for the people to more around and not get so aggrevated. The authorities from other countries came to the event to see what they had in store for the this program, and as said in the text the authorites say that ""these people are generating a revolutionary change and this is crossing borders. And in the United States, President Obama has ""ambtious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions"" Americans are buying fewer cars and are getting fewer licenses. By creating a new network that has the pedestrains have bicycles, private cars and commercial and public transportation. this to show time saved, conserved resourses, lower emissions and improve safety. by not just completly getting rid of cars but just reducing it, it may help them to have more smooth system.

To conclude this, the culture of cars has been a issue for someyears and in some areas very diificult to handle therefore they have created a more effiecent way to make life easier for most people. the world has to reduce the smog and increase the space for more compact living and larger populations. By not to get rid of the culture car completly but to just reduce it can be benificial to the people and the world.                     ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Many people do not agree with this change in society because it makes getting around more difficult. But on the other hand if you get to thinking about it it is healthier for the environment and yourself. To get more into detail let me continue...

Who likes to walk? Most people would say i hate walking but now they have no choice or else they will pay the price. You could take the chance of driving, if you want to pay $40,000 just for a parking space!!! In source one they explain that because of the high fine and parking rates over 70 percent of Vaubans famiies do not own cars and 50 percent sold teir cars just move there... It was different in Paris, people were only allowed to drive their cars on a specific day according to their tag numbers. Paris is smog house of all the european capitals. To avoid trafic jams and smog Colombia started the ""car free day"" which is when citizens can only take the bus or a taxi to work or where they needed to get.

President Obama has a goal to stop the greenhouse gas emission. Officials state that each year the amount of cars being sold has decreased drastically along with the amount of lisences given. My opinion for the cause of this is because teenagers would rather be with friends going out to parties but cant drive home alone so they car pool.. Maybe thats not the case maybe its the increase in gas cost. Why should you waste gas instead of just going along with someone else.

Some people believe it or not may not drive because they want to get into shape instead of being lazy and driving. Air pollution may have a big partake in the decreasing rates of driving, all you hear on the news is about the world ended new deseases whats next the ozone layer being eaten away by the chemicals given off by cars. It may not seem like a big deal now but thats what everyone says until it actually happens and you have no where to hide. Theres not much anyone could do to completely stop air pollution but if everyone obeys the rules set in certains parts of the world the environment would be a much better place to live in. So next time you want to go out cruisen look at the big picture before thinking about the fun!

We our polluting our air,and killing our planet. Limiting car usage would make an enormous difference, To our plant and to our everyday lives."" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" Carlos Arturo Plaza states. Putting limits on our car usuage will be better for our health, we will be able to inhale better air.

Limiting car usage will do a lot for us, our atmosphere, and our enviroment. A day without cars is part of an improvement campaign, in Colombia. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. ""The turnout was large,"" source 3 states. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"" said Enrique Rivera. They made a difference.

In the United States car rates are going down each year, little by little. Sociologist believe the pattern will continue. Sociologist states ""it will be beneficial"" if the pattern does persist. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a shift,"" said Mimi Sheller. If the rates keep dropping, and car usuage keeps decreasing. We'll be creating a better world.

82839AA9BE9B,"""You can live in your car, but you can't drive your house."" This is a quote my teacher used to tell me as advise for the future. This was a way of saving money if you had to choose between paying rent or paying your car bills if you were in this situation. However, what he did not realize is its more useful to use less of your car.

Using less of your car improves the enviroment. Using less will reduce the pollution in the air that we breathe in. When we reduce our car use we reduce the amount of resources like fossil fuels and nonreuseable resources. When we use cars and create pollution we also create a smog, but when we stop using cars we can clear the smog. In paris, they banned car use for a certain amount of time and it reduced the amount of smog. In fact, in the article

Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog , it says ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.""

Another thing that reduces is your payments for your car. How can you pay for a car if you don't have one? The answer is you don't. Without a car you don't have to pay car payments or repair payments. You also don't have to worry about getting fines or looking for parking spaces. In the article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , it reads ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park- large garages at the edge of the develpment, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.""

If you are not already worried with you car payments, you would be worried about your children's safety. Accidents happen all the time from cars. And if you're not in an accident you could be the one with a car breakdown on your way to work. Now you may say, I need a car because I have to drive to work or drop my kids at school. Than here is a solution, in the article

The End of Car Culture it says, ""Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has fascilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.""

If we were to get rid of carsall over the world we would have such a better enviorment. Wouldnt you want a better enviorment for you and the younger generation to see. One of the main things that is polluting our cities is gas. More perpheribly diesal. There are over a thousand  cars being driven in one city and all that gas that is used spreads to thye enviorment and causes deformation to our wild life. Many people dont realize that when diesal gas comes out of your exaust is a thick black smock that stays in that area for at least five minutes. Also when people get oil leaks they always say i'll get it checked tomorrow but never do and when they do get it checked the are leaking oil all over the street to get to the shop to get it fixed.

No more deaths would come of car accidents. Think about is every day you see something in the news about a car accident weather its car on car or someone being it by cars. cars cause alot of deaths in the world because people dont realize the amount of power they have and are always tring to impress. Hiting someone with your car expecially a child can scare a man for life because everyday when he gets in that car he is reminded of that day. Also think about all of the robberies. There wouldnt be much of that happening because they wouldnt be able to make a fast escame to get away with it. There is another thing solved by taking away cars, less criminals.

Less obese people would be living in the world because the wouldnt be able to get in their moterized vehicle to go to places. they would have to walk and even if there taking the train they are at least walking some where to get to that train. What if trains werent aloud either? You would definatly have less people over weight because they would be riding bikes or walking some where or if there late for something they wold run . Bogata has already made one hundred and eighteen miles of bicycle paths.

Birds cherping all over the city. Getting ride of cars would reduce the sound level and would allow wild life to come in to the cities.

Never the less having a car is a great responsiblitiy, like driving the right way, and not driving reckless. That could end up bad, because you know how law enforcement is they will pull you over for anything. Then on top of that they will give you a big fat nasty ticket to pay, so that really ruins what you have to like pay your bills or something. Plus its always better to just take public transportation, because trying to get a car that's worth $40,000, isn't even worth it, if your still paying for it, then you will have to take really good care of that car.

The car is at its lowest did you know that, because nobody buys them anymore, or nobody gets there permit. Cars are becoming nothing anymore, the roads America bulit will be soon for nothing. Like I said your better not buying a car, then spending all that money, and you have to spend more money on it later, Like if you get a ticket, or you have to pay to get it fix. Pointless absolutly pointless cause most people just uses cars to get from A to B, nothing else like what's the point of having a car if your not going to use it all the time might as well just take a bus, and spend like 50 cents, or something.

If you really want a car, at least use it instead of just showing it off, and letting it dust in your driveway, or garage. People in other countries like say Germany, all they use is bikes. They live a life without cars, and look at them saving all that money, and what if it is a poor country at least there not greedy and selfish.

Soon you will realize that all that money you spent was all just a waste, and you could have done somethimg else better to spend it on.

I'm not saying don't buy a car, Like I mean don't buy the most expensive car ever cause like that's just herendous. Like just buy something that's nice and cheap like maybe a Nissian not a Ferrari. Imagine if you run out of money what are you going to do ask people to help, Your going to have that fancy car, and be like ""oh what will i do"". You will realize that you messed, and that when you were being all selfish and greedy, nobody will care to help you. It's like all these other regular people who use there money wisley and not be selfish. The car is nearly at it's end cause soon there will be no more gas, what will you do. It's at the time where you make your own desisions, and think about do I really want to spend my money on a car, or do I want to be smart and ride the bus, or a bike and save my money and help the enviorment.                    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In the artical it said that parks and sport centersalso have boomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad,smooth sidewalks, rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restronts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

Some other advantages of limiting car usage would be that people would be more fit and not fat since they have to bike or walk places instead of eating mcdonalds and driving around. And since there alweays biking or walking places they would feel stronger and not as week they would know that in a situation where there stranded witout a car they can ralay on walking places since there more used to walking than driving. And i feel that if people started walking instead of driving people would be more friendly to each other and they would know one another but if everyone was driving like how they are they are there only way of comunication is to honk at one another so they never actually get to talk and get to know each other.

Some ideas i have to make this work is to make the tikets of driving a car higher and make smoother and better roads/sidewalks, and if you really want this to work you have to make better bikes that are easyer to ride faster sronger and more reliable other than selling a piese of metal on two weels or you could lover the prises of bikes and walking shoes because not everyone can afford the best bikes and walking shoes so if you lowerd your prises people can actually afford transportation such as bikes, skateboards and all that other good stuff instead of a car.

There is only so much space on earth and alot of it is taken up by parking. No matter where you go there will always be parking spots on the fertile ground that we need to preserve. Garages, street parking, and driveways not only house vehicles but they also take up valuable space! By limiting the use of cars we can cut back on the land wasted to house them.

Another important advantage to limiting car use is that it will save you money! Everyday we hear about a new car that just came on the market but the price only keeps on increasing. No one wants a cheap car that they are embaresseed to be seen in and many pay vigorously for new upgrades. The biggest expense is gas, which you will have to pay for almost everyday as the price keeps rising.

Finally, car usage is extremely bad for the environment. Paris is in days of near-record pollution and its become so bad that they had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Every time you start your car smog comes out of your exhaust polluting the air. After awhile it falls back to the ground and sticks so when it rains the roads become very slick which is a major hazard.

It is crucial to the future of the environment for the world to act now and use less cars. Cars produce emisions that are very bad for the ozone.

All the resources they need are within the community and definently within walking or biking distance. This is just one of many progressive ideas that has proved succesful and very beneficial.

Meaning that, Paris had to ban driving because there was so much polution going on. Pollution is one of the biggest problems in the United States today. And most of the people argue about it when it's actually them causing all of it.

In addition, the reason why they limit car usage is because in some small countries like, Colombia can cause a lot of traffic jams.

Meaning that cars were causing all of the rain showers and that is why Colombia banned cars for one day only to decrease the traffic jam and to do somthing about the rain showers that is happening daily.

In Vauban, Germany residents have given up their vehicles. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district. Car ownership is allowed but there are only two places to park in a large garage at the edge of the development where a car-owner buys a space for $40,000, along with a home. This results in 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move there.(source 1)

After a number of day of pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined 22-euros the same for odd numbered plate the following day. The cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. The smog cleared enough monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numberd plates on Tuesday.( source 2)

AFCC087987D7,"Cars are used used in everyday life but they may be used too much because of all the damage they do to the environment and the citizens must be informed on it. Cars are used to help get around easier unless if towns are developed so that people can walk or ride a bike everywhere. Cars cause pollution which causes smog and it can really hurt peoples health and the environment. A life without cars can make plenty of people happy due to the fact that people get injured or die in cars every day.

To start off most towns do not build buildings close together because people have cars which takes up more time to get there and money for gas. If buildings were made closer together everyone could get to the stores quickly and back home in time for special events. If buildings were made closer gasoline would be less of a problem due to the prices being high. In a town called Vauban in Germany seventy percent of all families do not own an automobile.""All of our development since World War two has been centered on the car,and that will have to change"" said David Goldberg.

Cars are known to cause pollution and some places have a partial ban on cars. Paris is well known for the Eiffel Tower and also its pollution problem so Paris allowed people with even and odd number license plates to only drive on certain days or else they will be fined. When cars cause pollution it makes smog and smog can kill crops and animals if it gets out of control. Currently heavily populated areas such as Newyork has a big pollution problem causing grey skies.

A life without cars is a happy one according to some people. A place in Colombia calles Bogota made an event called ""Car-free day"" which is a day where everyone goes the entire day without driving ""It's a good opportunity to take away streaa abd lower air pollution"".""These people are generating a revolutionary change and it is crossing boarders"".""The rain hasn't stopped anyone from participating"".

The reasons people should cut down on car usage is to lower pollution in the air. It just makes people happier without vehicles. Towns could be made with closer buildings to prevent using too much gas. Smog can really make an environment unhealthy by killing some of the plants that are there.

D10B149161A1,"Starting with the end of World War II, cars have been a cultural hub all around the world, with businesses and even entire economies relying on the production and sale of cars and car products. However, after over sixty years of a car based global economy, the use of cars is beginning to slowly decline. With the decline of car usage, we see decreases in greenhouse gas pollution, a more relaxed living style, and the dawn of a new era of culture and economy around the globe.

Several major cities around the world have attempted to lower car-use through laws or even annual days devoted to reduced car-use. In Vauban, Germany, seventy percent of the population does not own a car, and fifty three percent of that population sold a car to move to Vauban. Vauban has condesed its suburban layout so that everything is within practical walking range for the most part. They have also discouraged car-use by making parking only available in two places, ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home"" (Rosenthal, paragraph 2). Vauban has reported drastic reductions in greenhouse gases. Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting ""car-reduced"" communites in order to cut down greenhouse gas emissions, and legislators are acting on the issue. Experts claim that public transportation is beginning to play a larger role in suburbs, and a larger budget is now being given to public transportation instead of highways. Paris also has reduced driving to reduce smog, but they did it through laws. After suffering record-breaking pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban on driving. On Monday, even-numbered license plates could not drive, or they would be fined twenty two euros, or about thirty one dollars. On Tuesday, the same thing applied to odds. From this driving ban, congestion was lowered up to sixty percent in the French capital. Throughout multiple global cities, these reductions of car-use have had a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions, and more cities are beginning to join in.

Along with the benifit of reduced greenhouse gases, car-reduced societies also have a more relaxed living style. In Vauban Germany, citizens have claimed that they are enjoying a more relaxed life with much less stress. Heidrun Walter was quoted in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal, paragraph 3). Andrew Selsky's article on car-free days in Bogota, Colombia also states that people enjoy the relief of less stress when they don't use their cars. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife"" (Selsky, paragraph 24). If a drop in car-use leads to a happier, healthier life style, this will most likely set off a cyclicle action of car-use reduction to relief of stress and back to car-use reduction. As more people realize this potential benifit of reducing car-use, more people will beginning to join the population of reduced car-use.

The vast empire of cars that began with the end of World War II has reached its peak and is beginning a steady decline. For nearly seventy years, cars and car products have been a cultural and economical stimulant in both developed and developing countries. From the Model-T to the Buggatti, cars have been percieved as the thing to have over radios, television, and other mass media. Now that they are becoming less used, culture will slowly begin to shift to a different source to hype about. The production of new models of cars and new types of cars will slow and eventually halt all together. As well as culture evolving to a new phase, economy will also undergo major changes. Economy all around the world has been stimulated by auto industries, and international trade has been influenced heavily by it. For example, foreign cars are driven in America more often than domestically-manufactured cars. Now that car-use is declining, the economy will suffer a major crash in stocks in the auto industry. Although this crash will harm the economy, the ever-changing population of Earth will quickly find some new innovation to obssess over and the market will quickly recover and improve on this new product. With a new culture and economy, the world will be in a new era, a new age of living.

With the decline of car usage, we see decreases in greenhouse gas pollution, a more relaxed living style, and a possibilty of a new era of culture and economy around the globe. As the problems with cars are found, people have and will continue to resolve the problem by reducing car-use. The Earth will become healthier with a nicer atmosphere, the population will lead happier lives, and culture itself will transform with the end of major car-use.

74114448395C,"Cars have made a drastic impact on the world as a whole; however, times are begining to change in the necessity of cars and personal trasportation. Other countries, such as France, Germany, and Columbia has worked on reducing cars in their society. The benifets from the sucess, expensives, and health qualites have increased in the low-car communities. Accoring to Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Moter Company stated in paragraphs 43""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve rescources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Basically explaining that cars are not as needed and countries all over the world, inlcuding America can reduce, if not emliminate personal vechiles.

In Freiburg, Germany, the streets of this community are car-free, show in paragraph 2. Instead of cars they have trams to assist them in their travels. On average, a car space is $40, 000, not including the actual home. This dictrict is trying to remove the use of cars not just becasue of expenses, but also for health from smog and other possible harms. Cars are quoted as ""cash traps"" from the continual expenses needed to pay in paragraph 32. In America, they produce up to 50% of gas emissions in certain locations; whereas, Europe only gets to about 12% in paragraph 5. America is one of the most fuel wasting countries and causing damages and polutions. In addition, their expenses of appropriationgo to about 80% of highways androad work and only 20% to other trasportations.

Columbia dircects ""Day Without Cars,"" which is to alude citizens to other forms of transportation and to reduce smog in paragraph 21. If a person were to violate that day and use a personal vechile, he/she would be fined. The affect of this day has decresed smog, traffic, danger, and stress. Communites have more connection and environment  becasue of the simple reduction. Plazas, shops, restaurants, sidwalks, and bicycle trails have been upgraded for the citizens to enjoy due to less cars. These countries may increase health from the consistant walking and apprearance of the environment.

In conclusion, by limiting car usage, citizens expensives, enviroment, and health are benifited as shown in these articles. Expenses will be converted to other aspects within the community, like the style in Columbia with upgrades on the society. Smog, gasses, and other safety/ health factors will decreses from a reduction in cars. Overall, the reduction in cars will be benifical of society around the world.                             ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
948596ED1AA0,"Many people believe that it is necessary to use a car to get from one place to another. Many studies have shown that this in fact is not true. There are many advantages to limiting car usage. I am in favor of limiting car usage because of the advantages it brings to the world. One reason to limit car usage is, because it reduces the amount of pollution. Another reason, is because many people around the world are in favor of limiting car usage. Lastly, limiting car usage lowers emissions and improves safety. Beneficial and critical, limiting car usage helps humans as well as the environment.

First of all, limiting car usage reduces the amount of pollution worldwide. Reflective and didactic, Robert Fuller's ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" reflects the amount of pollution that is reduced due to limited car usage. For example, Robert Fuller explains that ""...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" This statement layers Robert's opinion that car usage can create vast amounts of pollution. If car usage is limited, the amount of particulate matter would decrease. For instance, this theory is created when Robert Fuller states ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.""

Another reason, is because many people around the world are in favor. Appauled and enthusiastic, Andrew Selsky's ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", molds the theory that limiting car usage has many advantages. For instance, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. The fact that many people around the world are in favor of limiting car usage is shown, when Andrew Selsky sates that ""Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic."" Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus is also in favor as he states ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" These statements show that limiting car usage is very beneficial and has many advantages.

Lastly, limiting car usage lowers emissions and improves safety. This is shown in Elisabeth Rosenthal's ""The End of Car Culture."" Elisabeth states that ""...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" Elisabeth Rosenthal also states that ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions just behind power plants."" Limiting car usage also improves safety. Last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, proposed partnering with telecommunications. Bill Ford wanted to partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transpotation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" This statement forms the theory that limiting car usage has many advantages.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages. We as people of the world need to limit car usage for many reasons. The first reason is, because it reduces the amount of pollution. The second reason is that many people around the world are in favor of limiting car usage. The last reason is, because limiting car usage lowers emissions and improves safety. This is why we as citizens of the world need to limit car usage worldwide.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
762F8D750987,"Car usage all over the world has reduced and been reducing slowly. Some of the advantages of limiting car usage may be the reducing of pollution or just to save moeny. Also due to many different reasons, even if it's for their own needs, or to just minimize the pollution going on in different parts of the world. In many places car usage has been being limited for countries all over. If it's China, Spain, Columbia, Paris, Germany, or even the United States of America. Not all countries have taken part in trying to reduce the use of cars to an all time low. That may just be their own choice. While other countries are sure trying to cut the usage of car for a variety of reasons. Some places in the world are doing it so they can cut some of the pollution done to the world. And if you think about it if half of the world tryed as hard as they possibly could to try and minizie pollution the world wouldnt be so pulloted. I know cars aren't the only things that cause pollution, but its a pretty big part of the daily life for any person no matter where they are.

In Vauban, Germany a suburban area has almost completely given up driving and even owning a car. ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park"" (Rosenthal 2) but it cost a lot of money to even own a parking space. ""Car-owners can buy a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" (Rosenthal 2) That price may just be enough to keep people from owning a car all together. According to the article ""

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, 70 percent of Vauban's Families don't even own a car and 57 percent sold a car just to move there. Isn't that crazy? Imagine life without cars, it has advantages and disadvantages of course but advantages can lead to a positive outcome no matter what the reason is. By people in Vauban not owning cars they are most likely saving a lot of money because they don't have to buy the car, pay the ridiculous amount for a parking spot, and pay for the gas thats going to end up pollution the world anyway. Just a few of the many advantages in reducing or cutting out car usage completely.

Due to all the terrible and mass amounts of smog in Paris, France, they enforced a ""partial driving ban to clear the air or global city"" (Duffer 10). For example, in this article called ""

Paris bans driving due to smog

"" by Robert Duffer, on monday motorist with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine which turns out to be $31 U.S. Dollars. And then the same thing would happen to those whose license plates ended in an odd number the following day. This had to have cut pollution a huge amount. If you think about how many people are living in Paris, and you think about them all staying off the road due to a ban then you may be able to understand the amount of pollution that wasn't produced during this ban. Now Paris, did this for the advantage purpose of reducing the amount of pollution they had in their air and by not adding more to it. It couldn't have a negative impact they were doing something good for the enviornment even if it didn't really help that much. Out of the whole city of Paris about ""4,000 drivers were fined,"" and ""27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"" (Duffer 12). Another advantage that Paris had due to them banning car usage was that ""Congestion was down 60 percent"" (Duffer 14). The ruling French lifted the ban when the smog cleared up enough.

Bogota, Columbia turned what they did as a tradition, into a big hit to tons of poeple in other countries. ""

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota

"" by Andrew Selsky informed the public about what was started a few years ago back in Columbia.

For a day cars except for buses and taxis were banned. In the city of ""7 million, the goal is to promote alternative transportation and also reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" (Selsky 21) Due the day without cars, the city of Bogotas has ""118 MILES of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American City."" (Selsky 27) One advantage they had was that because of the day with out cars the parks and sports centers have been in the best shape they could possibly be in. They also did have to reduced the amount of pollution that was being put into the air, because it was such a big hit to other cities and countries.

Yet another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal called ""

The End of Car Culture

"", is stating the advantages in the United States and what has happened with the reducing of cars. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (Rosenthal 29) The minimizing of cars in The U.S. has some advantages those being, ""Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions"" (Rosenthal 29). New York City for example is home to the heart of public transportation due to all the taxis and the subway. Not many people in New York city drive or even own a car due to the congested streets, and the ridiculous amount of money you have to have just to park it like it was in Germany. Crazy amounts of money to park a car is just an outrage. The advantage here would be the money saved by not even owning a car and storing it. Another one would be the traffic is bad but not as bad as it would be if more people had cars. Public transportation is huge in New York. It's already expensive enough to live in New York imagine if there werent as many taxis and if the subway wasn't there at all. Picture all the pollution there would be.

To wrap up everything, as stated there are many advantages to reducing car usage all around the world. If it was to reduce smog or pollution of just to save money they are still advantages to decreasing the amount of times you use a car. If something is in walking distances why not just walk instead of taking a car and wasting money and also polluting the air (unless it's a hybrid). The limiting of car usage is slowly but surely growing all over the world. Yes, cars are faster to get places, but why waste the money and clean air to be somewhere quickly? Think of all the advantages there are in reducing car usage not the disadvantages.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E27F2BAC8CD9,"Limiting car use is not a new idea. It has been around for about 10 years now, but there has been a major spike in car usage and carbon-based emissions. Less and less people are using a car, and car sales have also gone in a downward spiral. Company chairman for Ford, Bill Ford, proposed a buisness plan for cities that have no practical use at the Mobile World Congress in Spain. Since even before the recession, less and less people are obtaining their licenses, and there has been an increase in major city populations, where driving is severly discouraged. Changes like these are leading to lower emisssions, improved saftey, conserved resources, and saved time, according to Ford.

Between 2001 and 2009, there was about a 23 percent drop in young people getting their license. These numbers are inspiring cities all over the world to make a change and do their part to make a change in the world. The capital of Columbia, Bogata has something known as a ""car-free day,"" where only busses and taxis are permitted to be on the road. Other drivers will face a $25 fine. Even in the rain people continued to not use their car. Two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar, also joined in for the first time this year. Bogota has a population of around seven million people, so even if they stop just a quarter of them from driving, then that could cut down on a lot of carbon-based emissions. In Paris, France, drivers were given 22-euro fines for even numbered license plates on one day, then odd numbered license plates the next. Congestion was down 60 percent, and this was after five days that Paris' emissions could rival those of major cities in China. France's tax policy that makes diesel fuel more viable than gasoline was partially to blame, according to Reuters. Diesel engines make up 67 percent of cars in France, which is much higher than their European counterparts. Compared to other captials, Paris has a much higher particulate matter as well. It had over 30 more micrograms than the next highest, which is Brussels, mostly due to the cold nights and warm days, which would trap carbon. After the smog was cleared, Paris released the ban on certain numbered license plates.

Another advantage to having no cars is that we have more people walking or riding their bike. While obesity rates in America have been turned around and are trending in the right direction again, there is always more that can be done. It will get people to be more active, and maybe try to eat healthier so they have more energy to walk to where they are going. There will always be obese people, especially in developed countries where junk food is sold around every corner. But we help those who want to change and be healthier by giving alternative choices instead of sitting while commuting. Of course, it would be ridiculous for somebody to have to walk 10 miles to get to work. Not everything can be perfect. Suburban towns would likely fade out of existance, making large cities larger and more intemit. Cars will never fully vanish. But you can do your part. The next time you have to go to the store that's withing walking distance, take a bottle of water and head out. Greenhouse gasses could be stopped, and it all starts with you.                                                             ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

We use cars in our everyday lives to transport us everywhere, whether it is from home to work or school and other places. What alot of people don't realize is all the advantages that not driving a car everyday has. If we were to use less vehicles in the U.S it would incourage most people to excercise more and have a healthier lifestyle. It would also help our environment be less polluted. Finally it would also help improve safety by decreasing the ammount of car accidents we have every year.

By not using a car every day, people would have to find other ways of transportation like riding bicyles or just simply walking everywhere. In the U.S we have a large percentage of obese people. I think this would help a large ammount of people lose weight by being more fit in there everyday lifes. It would incourge these people to play sports and go to parks more often. Our community would be much healthier and happier.

Not only will this new idea help our community but it would also help our environment be healthier by conserving resources and the atmosphere would be less polluted. Because we use cars everyday it has caused alot of air polution which is one of the many reasons why the ozone layer has been getting damaged. This would also benefit us by having better air to breathe. Our environment will be healthier and nicer for us to enjoy.

Finally this would help reduce the ammount of car accidents we have every year in the U.S. Most deaths in the U.S are caused by car accidents. By reducing the ammount of time we drive cars it would improve our safety and the ammount of deaths each year would be reduced. This would also be a benefit to our community because it would increase the number of our population.

Last in Bogota, Colombia they statred a program that spread to other countries. This is the thrid striaght year that cars have been banned.

Beijing, China were both known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel was blamed, since France has tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Paris typically has more smog than any other capitals. Because of the smog public transit was free of charge.

Cali and Valledupar joined the event for the first time. Other countries came to see this event. These people who invented a car-free day are generating a revolutionary change to today's world. The day without cars is part of an improvement in Bogota in the mid-1990's.

In today's world, President Obama has ambitious goals to shift in American behavior. America's love affair with it's vehicles seems to be slowing down by population growth. The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet new friends. Cellphones and car-pooling has been more flexible. Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation are woven to connect network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.

With all these changes, it all reflects to new priorites across the nation to fellow citizens to limit car usage in the future.    ",1,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In todays society, almost everybody relies on automobiles to get them to where they need to go. They help us get from point A to point B quicker than walking or riding a bike. Sadly though, the truth is that automobiles account for a large percentage of airborn pollution. The toxic fumes that cars emmit are extremely dangerous to the atmosphere and the enviorment. That is why I think it is so important that we try to limit automobile usage.

Its is a known fact that cars cause pollution. Its common sense. There is no point in me elaborationg any further on that. We as a species are substantially harmful to our home planet. Our obsession and constant use of cars further prooves this point. Limting car usage could drastically cut down on the pollution that we cause.

Another overlooked advantage of limiting car usage would be the cut down in stress that one feels. Constantly relying on and maintianing a well working car can be quite stressful. There is a lot of time and money that goes into keeping a well working automobile. This can cause lots of frustatration that is not healthy for anyone to experience.

Lets not forget the constant commuting and traffic that the autombile lifestyle is a part of. Every single day, millions of Americans are forced to wait hours and hours in traffic to get to thier jobs. Think about how quick it would take if you didnt have to wait in traffic. Not to mention, as we stated in the second paragraph, It would greatly cut down on pollution. Imagine if everyone who was commuting to work with you in traffic found another way to get to work. Think about how much air pollution that would cut down on.

The fact of the matter is that we need to cut down on car usage. I am not denying how great cars are. They make our lives substantially easier. I am merely saying that we need to cut down on the rate in which we use them. We need to be more conscious about the decisions that we make today in order to garuntee a safe and prosperous world for our future. Cutting down on automobile usage, thus cutting down on air pollution, can help make this come true.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
24C51EEC5D05,"Think about a country without cars. You might say thats rediculous but there are many pros to not having a fuel running engine as your transportation all the time. There are some families that dont even own cars. automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically to reduce geenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes.

Passanger cars are responsble for more than 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. There have been efforts in the past two decades to make sities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. Basic presets are being compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. Stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

Using to many cars for transportation isnt so good for any city, state, country for example France. After days of near record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after five days of intensifying smog. Most cars run on fuel so diesel fueal was blamed the majority of pollution in the air that cars produced. Delivery companies would complain of lost revanue, the exceptions were only made for plug in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge.

Its a really good opporunity  to take away all the stress and lower are pollution. Cars are great for transportation but the days without cars can be part of an improvement all around the world. parks and sports center can bloom throughout the city, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. If we persist with using car transportation as a resource less it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment, since  transportation is the second largest source of America emissions.

EA23D3F94AFF,"There are several different benefits of limiting car usage. Diesel fuel from cars tend to polute the air, so the less people use cars the less air pollution there will be. People will walk more than they did before with the limitations of car usage. The roads will also have less ""congestion"" or car traffic. These benefits are very helpful in many ways as to why car usage should be cut back for a while.

Over the years, air pollution has become a big problem everywhere. It basically poisons us with the air we breathe. When you have restrictions or limitations on car usage, it will help a lot because the less toxis chemicals you have in the air, the healthier it is for everybody, and the more safer the environment is.

Another benefit of limiting the car usage is people will walk more than they ever had before. For example, you usually don't walk unless you really have to, like when you're going shopping, walking a dog, or walking in school. But when you have a car and you're trying to get to a destination that's walking distance, you'll tend to get lazy and just drive that short amount of distance instead. We as humans don't walk until we actually HAVE to. Other examples as in, going to the grocery store to pick up a few things, walking the dog, mowing the lawn, etc. So the limitation on cars will help SO much more because it will actually MAKE people walk.

When you live in over-populated areas, congestion happens a lot. Congestion in this situation means car traffic. Congestion is very time consuming sometimes because the more traffic there is, the less time you have to complete a task you were planning on doing. Less cars on the road is a very good benefit to limitating car usage, a benefit to time, and a benefit to people on every level.

These are some of the benefits of limiting car usage. The air we breathe will be less polluted by a LOT, people will excersize and walk more, and there will be less congestion (car traffic), which will save more time. These benefits will help everyone in many different ways.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F6A5D4517596,"In America we have lots of cars, lots of roads, leading anywhere you want to go. In Europe they have car free cities where things may run a lot smoother;quicker. Limiting car usage could raise property prices due to lack of highway noise and can protentially save the world from population extinction due to smoke from the tail pipe.

On houses near the highway , of my knowledge, the price is usually lower because you have to suffer the aggonizing pain of the cars honking an zooming past. In the passage ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars""""When I had a car I was always so tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said  Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked the streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out  occasional distant motor."" Most American families want to live in quiet and peaceful homes. If cars were to be limited there would be less noise and then there will be a higher value for the houses next to the roadways.

Smoking an second hand smoking is one of the leading causes of death. All cars have a tailpipe and all cars let out ridiculous amounts of gaseous smoke during the average cars lifetime. In an article I read about Paris, titled ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", the goverment was over-whelmed by the amounts of smog in their city. They proposed a law to restrict drivers from driving on certain days based on their drivers license plate numbers. Thereby reducing the smog in the city. Then when the smog was cleared ramoved the restriction. Less smoke means more fresh air, more fresh air means more healthy and active people running around the world creating more jobs for a better future.

All throughout the world goverment, kings and parliaments are trying to dispel smoking while  cars are one of them, without them there will be higher property values and less greenhouse gases in the air. I believe with less cars in the world we will live a easier life with less coughing and wheezing.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In Vauban, Germany residents are living without cars. One women Heidrun Walter, a mother of two, explains how she is much happier without her car.  57 percent of people have moved to the community when they heard about the community. It is said to be called smart planning. Cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the U.S.. You don't have to worry about how your going to make it to your favorite store or market without a car because stores are places a walk away, on main street. The Enviormental Protection Agency is promoting car educed communities and legislators are starting to act.

Paris enforced a limiting driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France just after five days. France enacted a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline.

Bogota, Colombia created a program called the car-free day. Powerful people from other countries camre to Bogota to see the mindblowing event. Parks and sports center have been createdbecause of this event.

In the U.S. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting feweer licenses as each year goes by. Rates of car ownership per household and per person strted to come down two to three years befpre the downturn. Teens are starting to organize their life around when they can walk, take public transportation or car-pool.

Natiosn worldwide have vbegun starting a new trend/ orsmartplanning which limits cars usage due to the ecomony ,pollution it creates.

To begin with, limiting cars is becoming a new fad, people in  VAUBAN,Germany(Dorchland) say  it saves alot of time and money. Now you can just have your house in the suburbs and just stick to foot traffic youdont have to worry about car insurance or garages or keeping drive ways clean. No more dirty streets clean and motor sound free walking. With this new smart planning going on its harder for people to take there kids around and get to work. What goes along with this effect it saves people more money.

Lastly, Limiting usage of cars is going to help better the enviorment. Recently paris was under an enforced ban due to to a cloud of smog pollution. The use of cars releases toxi and bad gases into the atomosphere destroying are enviorment and causing effects on the polar ice caps. The limit use of cars cuts traffic down and time. another effect use we could use is a car free day were we could take buses , bicycles , and even skateboards. one major thing we should replace with our cars is public transports.

Inconclusion

Limiting cars usage is helpful and becoming more popular globally it can help the economy and also help slow down pollution.                                                            ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
1D7D099DEE87,"Many people in today's world depend on cars to get them places. They don't realize the effects cars have on our environment and how much better things would be if we limited car usage. There is many other ways of transportation that are much easier and better for our world. I believe car usage should be limited because it will cause less pollution, it will take away stress, and it will save people money.

When cars are used, they release chemicals into the air which causes pollution. Pollution is not good for our air and wears down our atmostphere. Global warming has always been a serious matter with the amount of people who drive cars so if we cut back on the car usage, it would decrease the amount of pollution going into the air. In Source 2 it shows an example of how Paris had intesifying smog because of these cars. They banned cars for a couple days and the smog level dropped. Also in source 2 it says "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france"". When cutting down on car usage, it helps many things and can help you stay healthy and feeling good.

Another major reason we should cut down on car usage is that it will take away a lot of stress us humans have. In source 3, buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said "" It's a good opurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Imagine your driving down the road and some guy pulls in front of you without a blinker and you almost hit him, you get all mad and stressed out that you almost hit him. Road rage is very common in drivers and we could decrease that stress with limiting car usage. Also if you were to get into a car accident, that gives you so much stress which affects your everday life.

To buy a car, you need lots of money. You need to buy the car, then buy insurance etc. Why don't just save your money instead of buying a new car when you could just use some other form of transportation. In source 4 it states, "" .. Cash strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployes weren't going to work anyways."" This shows that many people don't have the money to buy a car, why spend you money on a car that is not needed instead of buying something else. Cars are not mandatory, you can get to places many other ways and could save lots of money. Also you could save money on gas if you didn't have a car.

In conclusion, limiting car usage will only result for the better. There is plenty of other ways of transportation that aren't as harming and expensive as cars are.         ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Cars can cause alot of problems like for example, people get into many car crashes that kill many innocent children or bystanders, the traffic jams always take hours to clear up, and the exhaust in the tail pipe is polluting the air. There are many advantages to limiting car usage. The advantages are there will be more people on bikes and walking to place to place, less traffic, and less pollution in the air.

Although cars may come in handy they can be a real pain to have. Like for insatance paying car insurance every month, paying for gas, and paying for your car if anything breakes and needs a new part If the car usage was limited there will be more people on bikes and walking. This is good for the residents because they are spending less money and they are getting excersise from this. In Vauban, Germany the residents there have given up their cars. 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars (Rosenthal, 3). There only transportation there is a tram that runs though Freiburg (Rosenthal, 2). This helps residents there get to place to place eaiser.

Also with the car limitations there will be a whole lot less traffic on the roads. For example in Paris, France they made even numbered license plates residents leave their cars at home, then the next day odd numbered license plate residents (Duffer, 11). Even though they tried to ban the cars there were 40,000 drivers fined due to driving their cars (Duffer, 12). Also when this rule was put into place there was less traffic in the capital of France. The traffic went down by 60% (Duffer, 14).

Most importantly there will be less pollution in the air. Residents in cars dont really know how much pollution is put into the air when they drive. The exhaust from the tail pipe of a car is causing a huge defect in this earth's greenhouse effect. In france the pollution was so bad there was smog in the air from all the cars (Duffer, 14). The smog in France was as bad as the world's most polluted cities in the world, Beijing, China (Duffer, 14). Also in Bogota, Colombia there was really bad smog, but after the car limitation there was a huge decrease in the smog (Selsky, 21).

In conclusion, there are many advantages in car limitation. The advantages are there will be more people on bikes and walking to place to place, less traffic, and less pollution in the air. With less cars this will help our earth big time because the greenhouse effect will stop getting car exhaust pumped through there.

""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this new experimental district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders"". Says paragraph two in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", some people may find this scenrio strange but its actually becoming more common. Many countries all over the world are starting making either a ""car free day"" or on certain days, making people pay fines for driving.

First, an example of a ""car free day""  is in Paris, France. This city has typically more smog than other European capitals. ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found"".

The congestion went down sixty percent in the Capital of France, the smog cleared enough monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday.

Secondly, another example of a car free day is in Bogota, Colombia. ""Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work on car-free day"". This day in Bogota has been celebrated for three years straight now, ""where cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of seven million"".

In conclusion, countries all over the world are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and smog. Paraguay, France, Colombia, and even America is trying to get people to use different types of transportation and reduce smog. So citizens all over the world should just for one day not use a car. One person can start a revolution for their community, city, or state. If everyone all over the world could do this we would reduce tons of greenhouse gases amd smog.

Vauban, Germany- is a suburban area where 70 percent of the families that live there do not own a car, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Car ownership is allowed but there are only a couple places to park such as large parking garages at the edge of the developement where you can buy a parking space for 40,000, and with the purchace of a home. Residents of Vauban such as Heidrun Walter, mother of two children says when she owned a car she was was always tense and that she is much happier without a car. Vauban is home to 5,500 residents and may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life.

Paris, France nearly hit the record for highest polluted city in the world, until they banned the citizens from driving to clear the air of the global city. People who had an even-numbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at home or pay a 22-euro fine, which is 31$ in America, the same applied to the odd-numbered plates the following day. Approximetly 4,000 drivers were fined. Congestion was down 60 percent in Paris. After 5 days of intensifying smog rivaled Beijing, China, known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blammed for the mass pollution, Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France. The smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban or odd-numbered plates.

In Bogota, Colombia there is a program that is set to spread to other countries, where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work for a car-free day, leaving the large capital city devoid of traffic jams. The goal of this car-free day is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, the turnout was successful. Citizens of Bogota like Carlos Arturo Plaza says it's a good opprotunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.

Getting out of your car and taking a walk for a couple miles is something you should consider doing everyday. Walking has a insane amount of advantages, it can even save your life.

The ban on cars can seem a little crazy. But picture how much healthier people would be if they didnt relie on their car to get some where.

2715518BDE58,"Limiting car usage is beneficial to more than just the environment, it is also beneficial to humans. With all the pros and very few cons of limiting car usage, it would be impractical to not make the change. Some may argue that it would waste time to limite car usage, however, if widespread limitation of car usage occurs then the way we live will evolve to adapt to life without much car usage, making it far more convenient in the future.

A common misconception is that limiting car use is solely beneficial to the environment. In paragraph three a resident of Vauban is quoted saying, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" this shows that humans too can take advantage of limiting car use. In common culture today, destinations are far spread out and not compact unless in a large city. This is because it is possible to transport one's self those distances in a car. Limiting car use would effect the suburban culture of being spread out and change it into a more compact, convinient environment.

The obvious reason to limite car usage is to reduce air emissions that would allow us to have a safer earth to live on. Pollution has become a legitimant problem and if change isn't made, then the earth will be changed for the worse. Large cities where cars are abundantly used have a major problem with smog as seen in paragraph ten. In attempt to clear record breaking amounts of smog, Paris enforced a partial driving ban and it worked. This shows that by limiting car use change can be made to our environment for the better.

Without using a car, one would clearly need to find an alternative method of transportation. Common alternatives such as biking or walking spark a much more active lifestyle for those who do so. As seen in paragraph twenty-eight, Bogota sponsors alternate forms of transportation and when this active lifestyle was embraced by the city, it changed the city for the better. As result it is quoted that, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" This clearly displays a much healthier, active lifestyle by those who limite car use.

All of these products result in clear advantages caused by one thing, limiting car usage. It would be unsensible to not acknowledge that there is change that needs to be embraced in limiting car use in our society before it is too late to change the culture of driving.

4ED9DEAC9C60,"Around the world, cars are the main use of transportation. The exaust from cars causes pollution in the air world-wide. By limiting car use, you can easily cut the pollution levels released by cars in half. There are many great aspects of limiting car use. Some international cities have already set a day where citizens do not use their cars. Limiting car use is a great option for the enviroment. As it can help many individuals from all around the world.

In the city of Vauban, Germany, most citizens do not even own vehicles. ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here.""(Rosenthal, 3) Vauban claims to be a car free community. The banning of cars is a ""growing trend in Europe"" (Rosenthal, 4) The movement is called ""smart planning."" (Rosenthal, 4) Cars play a huge roll in polluting the Earth. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Rosenthal, 5) The ""Enviromental Protection Agency is promotiong ""car reduced"" communities."" (Rosenthal, 9) Limiting car use is a huge benefit for the Earth and people living in it.

In Paris, France, the pollution levels are increasing drastically. For that reason, Paris has decide to ban driving for two days. Citizens who failed to not drive were punished with a $31 fine. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"". (Duffer, 14) This statistic shows that by the limiting of car use, traffic levels may chage drastically. From the lower use of cars on the roads, the smog above Paris was clearing and moving towards Beijing. Which is ""one of the most polluted cities in the world."" (Duffer, 14) The main cause of the pollution is diesel fuel. France in particular favors deisel fuel. ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France"". (Duffer, 16) This is the prmary cause of the pollution in the city. By banning the cars, the city recieved clarity from the smog surrounding it prior to the ban.

In Bogota, Colombia, one day a year they ban all cars despite public transit. They have been doing this for three years. If a citizen failed to obey the car ban, a $25 dollar fine was given to them. Buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""(Selsky, 24) The car ban is part of an improvement campaign from the mid-1900s. Rain or shine the residents of Bogota still participated. This past year two additional cities participated in the movement. The movement has shown great success and has been helping with pollution and stress many individuals face daily.

In the United States of America, President Obama wants to lower the rate of greenhouse gas emmissions. Studies show that ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""(Rosenthal, 29) In 2005, there was a peak of the miles driven. In 1995, this was 9 percent lower this was also the case in April of 2013. Michael Silvak, an individual that studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute said, ""rates of car ownership per house hold and per  person sdtarted to come down two to three years before the turn down."" (Rosenthal, 33) As the years have past, the numbers of car owners have decreased. Although the idea of limiting car use sounds like a great idea, it will eventually hurt the automotive industry. People will stop purchasing cars due to these bans.

There are many widespread advantages to limiting the car use of individuals around the globe. Greenhouse gas emmission levels are essentially rising. By taking action and limiting car use, the world can decrease these levels. Less use of vehicles can help relieve stress, a condition a lot of people face around the globe. It is truly amazing that by banning cars for a day, the surrounding smog was clearer in Paris. The widespread happines in Vauban, Germany due to car-free living is another great outcome. Bogota's influence on two other cities is also very empowering. Limiting car use is not as bad as it may seem. In the long run, it will benefit our surrounding enviroment.

All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.

"" As an official of the Transportation for America, David Goldberg is a credible source for information regarding transportation in America. However there are places all around the world were automobiles are causing problems. Limiting car usage could help solve many of those issues.

In America, the topic of alternative transportation has been  discussed many times, but in previous bills, 80% of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20% to other transport. This can be found in paragraph 9 of the first source as the fifth line. Sadly America is not the only country having problems. In

Paris, France , diesel cars make up 67% of the vehicles and the diesel feul is blamed for the smog accumulation in the city. In Paris, A warmer layer of air caused by cold nights and warm days, trapped the car emissions which then caused a five day period of intensifying smog. France's smog build-up rivaled that of

Beijing, China , which is claimed to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. This problem also exists in the States, as transportation is the second largest cause of America's emissions, right behind power plants. To ensure safety anyone who was still driving their car was fined 22- euros or $31.

Bogota, Columbia followed France in their violation fee and charged any violater $25. Bogota has created a

Day Without Cars , in which no cars are used, to promote alternative transport and the reduction of smog levels. Another positive effect no cars can have would be a more peaceful enviroment, as stated in sources 1 and 3. In America, recent studies show that Americans have been buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. Although it may be far in the future, America may soon follow the lead of

Vauban, Germany , where it is completely car-free. This probably won't happen anytime in the near future, but the use of automobiles has gone down in the United States. Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor company, proposed a city in which, pedestrians, bicycles, private cars, etc. are used to save time, lower emissions and improve safety. He sees this future, hopefully others will too.

Although America might not be exactly like Vauban, it is good to hope that it will get there someday. No cars would result in a calmer atmosphere and a more peaceful lifestyle. Also, it would lower the emissions made by vehicles, which in turn would save the atmosphere, thus saving life on earth. No cars would also help improve safety, both of animals and of people. We may not be completely there yet, but the world will someday have no need for cars and that will be the first step into the future.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
81193A1AF476,"In the time we live in today everybody or almost everybody has a car. That's how a lot of us get around. People that were raised in the twenty first centry thinks that there's something wrong with buses or taxies. I truly believe that there's nothing wrong with taking cars off the road for a day or so. Maybe we should try it.

Saving the planet by doing something minor wouldnt hurt anyone. ""It's a good oportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This is absolutely true because our enviroment is already gettin clogged up with bad air pollutions. Also, people stress about getting some where on time.""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Maybe, the United States should consider it as a campaign as of trying to teach younger kids that everything isn't just about having a car. Taking another transportation that doesn't consider your car will help you realize that you can go out and explore outside of your car. Cars shouldn't really be your frist priority.

Municipal authorities from other countries camt to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change."" Limiting car usage is like everyone who smokes cigaretts stop for a limited amount of time. Its a wonderful thing to do especially when its cutting down on bad pollutions in the air. ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to the highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" This is real selfish of the United States , this lets me know that even though we have our own transportation they dont really want to take care of the other transportations we have because they feel as if their not important to us. As far as I know a lot of people still rides buses,taxies,or even walk because they dont have cars. We should definetly take a day to leave our cars at home and get around by other transportations.

Cars aren't bad to have. They actually help in a lot of ways. We could always use a time to save the planet from pollution , accidents anything thats possible to happen in a car. Especially, if its going to help in the future or even help in the present. That time should start now .                                          ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
83D8A875FA7A,"Cars have been the main use for transportatation from one distant destination to another. The population is relying on cars more often to get them to were they need to be. Everyone in the communities are becoming lazier and cannot bother to grab a bike or even a pair of skates to help them get where they need to go. More and more of the population do not want to walk to the store which is usually down the street. Cars have even been polluting the atmosphere causing numerous issues, such as health problems and even a rise in the temperature of the planet. The purpose of this essay is to inform fellow citizens of the advantages of limiting car usage.

By limiting the amount of cars we have in the country or even by reducing the days one can use their car, can dramatically reduce the pollution in the atmosphere and also cause citizens to become more active and healthy. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders.""(Source 1, Paragraph 2). Vauban is one community to begin their journey to becoming a car reduced area. ""As a result, seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move here.""(Source 1, paragraph 3). As said by one of the residents, ""When  I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heindrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.""(Source 1, paragraph 3).

Paris is another city to take on the challenge of limiting the use of cars. Paris is a city where there is an abundance od smog and pollution. ""After days of near-record pollution Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""

(Source 2, paragraph 10). Because of such effort, ""Congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...""(Source 2, paragraph 14). By limiting car usage citizens have only one option, to get up find a bike or running shoes and set out for the day. By doing this the peoples can become very healtthy and reduce the chances of life treatening illnesses, such as cancer and others such as diabetes and lung and heart problems. Just think of the environment, by using less cars we can lower of even completely stop the effects of global warming which can lower the the rising of the sea and help to stop the destruction of the ozone.

""BOGOTA, Colombia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or even took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of trafic jams.""(Source 3, paragraph 20). These simple and energizing activities can get you to where you need to be and also gets and keep you active and moving. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.""(Source 3, paragraph 24). ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift, "" said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center.""(Source 4, paragraph 35). The world is changing and with it the health of the people and the condition of the environment.

By taking time from using motor vehicles we can lower the pollution of the world and improve the health of the people who live in it. By lowering the production of cars, citizens will have no choice but to grab their bikes or skates or even running shoes and begin to move. The time is now for the community to change. Many different cities have already started their change with cars and now is the time for you to join in the movement.

AB82D5A5251C,"Having a limit on car usuage has many advantages to it. This limitation mainly benefits the people and the enviroment.

A major advantage of the limitation is to help the people. Many of the people like not having cars avaliable. In

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , a family says "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.(Rosenthal)"" Not having a car takes pressure off of the people, because they don't have to worry about filling up on gas. They also like it ,because it encourages more excercise. Instaead of driving to the store or the park you can walk or take a bicycle. In the artcile

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, some of the staticstics show that ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city;uneven, pitter sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut off traffic; and new restutants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"". This is an example of how progresive this change has made on cities. Also metioned in Selsky article "" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". Most of the people say that not having cars takes alot of stress off of them. The positive impact on the people is just one of the many advantages of limited car usuage.

Anouther advantage is helping the enviroment. By limiting car use has really impacted the enviroment. Rosenthal states that ""experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes.... Passengers cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe"". This just shows how much of an impact not using cars has been. In article two Duffer explains why Paris created limitation on car usuage. Paris had a huge smog and to help clean it up and to prevent from getting worse, Paris made a law that only certain number license plates could drive on certain days and if you drove on the wrong day than you would be fined. But this helped France get their fuel numbers lower. In Selsky article he talks about how Columnia has a ""car free day"". On this day no cars are allowed with the exception of buses and taxis. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"".  Alot of the people like to participate in this event. In Amercia research has been found that ""Amercians are buying fewer cars,driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (Rosenthal).With this information we can be lowering our pollution on our own. Many people did not like the limitations, but learned to like them considering the end result of a healthier enviroment. These two advantages of limiting car usuage is just a couple of the many.

F621D9125CCD,"As time goes on the use of cars have greatly decreased. The car use in some places are actually limited. There's communities where stores and parks are built close enough to walk or bike to. Other places there's actually days where the use of cars are restricted and only buses or transits become the only transportation allowed on the road.

""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experiment new district..."" (Rosenthal,paragraph 2). This community even forbids anything involving cars, making streets less crowded and never having to look both ways to cross the street. This is only an experiment to take this all away, to some it's punishment. As a result, 70 percent of families in this community do not own cars.

This idea of no cars has spread all over the world. ""Paris enfoced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"".(Duffer, paragraph 10). This city in France is banning the use of cars to reduce the amount of smog in the air. ""Diesel fuel was blamed..""(Duffer, paragraph 16). Because this city prefers diesel over gasoline, there's more pollution in the air. Therefore needing to reduce the amount of  car usage.

""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, took the buses to work during a car-free day..."" (Selsky, paragraph 20). There's even a day for this idea just to reduce the use of cars. ""These  people are generating a revolutionary change..""(Enrique Riera, Selsky, paragraph 26). Any participant of these places are supporting this idea as a positive revolution.

""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"".(Rosenthal, pargagraph 29). Fewer cars are being purchased so not many people are driving. Because not a large amount of people make their legal license a priority they choose to walk or take the bus. ""it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment...""(Rosenthal, paragraph 34). Limiting the use of cars is positive physically, financially, culturally, and better for the enviornment.

As time goes on the use of cars have greatly decreased. Limiting the car use is becoming a revolution taking place all over the world. Think of using a bike or a new way of transporting to work one day.

To begin with, being car free would be better off because it reduces the level of polution. For example,""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"" as stated by Robert Duffer in the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"". Paris made a driving ban that fined different drivers on certain days going by their liscence plate numbers. This law caused the smog to clear just enough for the French to uplift the ban. Another example of where being car free reduced polution is in Bogata, Columbia. Where anually they'd go a day without cars.

In this town, citizens are living lives without a lot of stress. They enjoy riding tandem bikes with their wives and walking alone. In Paris, the act has been picked up. Since it's so popular, Paris streets hold many cars. Now that the temporary law has passed, the amount of smog has dropped dramaticaly.

When cars aren't used, lives are saved. Car accidents happen very often and oftentimes they are fatal. When you have a car, you become able to get a DUI. Owning a car can bring you extensive fines, even when you make a small accident in a fraction of a second.

With the economy the way it is, who can even afford a nice car? Bikes are much cheaper and safer for people as well as the environment. If everyone in the world stopped using their cars for a month, we might be able to save a species from dying out, or maybe slow the desintegration of the ozone layer.

0AB9C286F515,"Would you rather walk or drive a car going to work?

it would be much more easier to drive a car, right? In today's generation people use their car for transportation going to work or just driving around. All their going to do is pay more gas and spend more,but gas today is more expensive than years ago. Many people need to realize that their are to wasting gas and it can create more traffic jams because many people need to get to their destination on time or not on time. The fellow citizens needs to have an advantage of limiting car usage.

To begin with, Car can create more gas usage because many people just go to shorter destination or longer destination. But the things is that people just waste gas because they dont realized how they are spending a lot of money. For example, a girl is going to the store closer to home, she is thinking if she going to drive her car or walk and she is thinking to drive her car, why? because she would rather not walk or she is to lazy. The girl is wasting her gas. In today's society many people need to open their eyes and realized thing on how much they are spending on car usage.

According to this source 3: ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in

Bagota"", "" Bogota, Columbia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, bikes, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jam (paragraph 20)"". This quote states that many of the Colombians are supporting their country car usage. They would rather hiked, bikes, skated or took buses to work. Also, it cannot lead to traffic jams. The fellow citizens need to look over what many people are trying to do to limit their car usage because other people cannot afford buying a car. For example,  many years ago only people who are wealthy can only afford cars and those who cannot afford it, they would make an effort to make things as possible to get in their destination and enjoy walking rather than riding car.

Furthermore, walking and riding a bike could make things possible for everyone. People need to notice that driving a car could make things much harder. According to this source 1: "" In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", "" In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are to act, if cautiously"". This quote states that the United States are planning to reduce car usage because it looks like many people today are having a lot of car accidents. For example, driving while texting. This can create less accidents.

In conclusion, Fellow citizens need to set their limits on car usage.

they need to realized on how it  can create a mess in the world full of car transportation. Also, knowing on how much they pay for gas  and also it can lead to massive traffic jams. They need to have  advantage of using car usage. They could ride a bike or walk to go reach their destination.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

I wanted to inform you that there is a limit for driving a car there has been some changes during this few years. Its not only in America that is going on its in other cities and also in states, where people have been droping there adavantages to drive around and dicide to walk instead or to ride a bus to get to other places, they also do that to save money for the gasoline especially if they drive long distance. For example in German Suburb they have forbidden street parking, driveways and home garages, new district on outskirts of freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. There's a place called Vauban's and its a total Car-free, 70% of vaubans don't own a car and 57% sold thier car to move here. In Paris, they have banded driving due to smog, can ya'll believe that?;they have done because after days of near pollution paris inforced partial driving to clean the air of global city. people that drived with a even-numbered license plate they were charged a 31 dollars fine almost 4,000 drivers were fine according to Reuters. Now the ""smog"" came from Beijing,China which is one of the most polluted city in the world.

Paris typically has more smog then other European capitals, but eventually the smog cleared enough for The Ruling French party. There's was also a Car-Free day in Bogata and it was a big hit, Colombians usually hiked,biked,skated or even took buses to work during the car-free day if you left early people avoid traffic jams. and there goal is to promte alternative transportation and reduce smog it was a good ways to take way stress and lower air pollution. there's parks and sports centers that have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad,rush-hours have dramatically cut traffic.

Cars are becoming fewer and fewer in some places of the past few years. People are less dependant on personal transportation which in turn creates a safer, healthier enviroment for ourselves and the others around us.

By limiting car usage the main reaction would be less pollution and less smog in largeer cities. Places like New York, Paris, Berlin, London, or Beijing could look so much better. Everywhere you look you see and hear about pollution and Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming. All this is caused mainly by humans hand and the cars we drive spitting out toxic Carbon Dioxide wastes. In Paris they had a one day ban of half the cars in the city and the smog went away in that amount fo time.(Source 2) If we limited cars we could unlimit our world to a new, longer lifespan, because cars are truly ripping our planet to pieces.

The chance of finding public transportation in America is very slim. Most places you go don't have subways or things like ""der U-Bahn"" in Deutschland. Our counrty is made for cars and we throw money at them every year which will eventually come to bite America in the butt. 80 percent of appropriations have gone to higways and the rest goes to other types of transport in America.(Source 1) By creating more viable public tansportation methods we could cut the spending on highways and put the money back into public transportation. By doing so we could limit accidents at the wheel and reduce pollution which I mentioned earlier. We already know that this system works in Vauban, Deutschland where residents rarely own cars and they live happier, quainter lives. (Source 1)

The time to by a car is not now. Recent studies show that car purchases, licenses, and driving has become fewer as each year goes on.(Source 4) Either from high vehicle and gas prices or an actual social spectical, driving is slowly decreasing all over the world. Hopefully within the next 25 years, public transportation will be a MUST in cities all over the globe, and I'm not just talking about buses. People are more reliant on planes and trains in Europe than any other continent. And we could benefit highly from what we learn elsewhere.

If we just join together and stop driving alltogether for just one day, the results would be both extraordianry and frightening. We have neglected to see that by not limiting our car usage we have limited our time on this planet.

Henry ford revolutionized the world when he produced the model T. Ever since then driving has been a huge part of life in the world. it makes life easy and it has almost become our own ""coming of age""  ceremony to when you can finally get your lisence. having a lisence is just more freedom and it as become in most societies more than just a piece of plastic showing you can drive. now it is used as your ID. it is used to show your age, where you are allowed into, whether or not you can buy alcohol. getting your lisence is almost a necessity now.

Now, if the entire world were like the Vauban where there were individual suburbs with wide sidewalks, their own restaraunts, and own grocery stores all with in reasonable biking distance, then sure, I'm all for  ditching the car. But, in every day life the car is a necessity. Now im only speaking from what ive seen in my little town on the coast of Florida. I agree that the car in New York carries less value and need than where i live. But people still own them, the streets are still always full, and taxi cabs are still cars. It'd be different if you took the subway of the big eat coast cities or the cable cars of the west coast ones. But taking a taxi is still burning precious fuel that is harmful to our air.

These ""car free utopias"" sound very good. They may even be a success, but the main thing they lack is practicality. There is nothing practical about these places. They reduce fuel use and smog and air polution sure.

Having cars can cause unecessary problems such as, gas money, oil changes, and simple break downs that cars sometimes have.

In the United States, South America and across Europe, they have developed new ways of transportation that seem to be more beneficial. In these souces they explain the many advantages of limiting car usage such as its better for the environment and people find more alternative ways of transportation easier and cheaper.

There are many benefits to limiting car usage and the first is it improves the environment. In Source 1, it says that reducing car usage would be, ""A huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes"". Passengers in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and 50 percent in the United States. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. In that change recently,there has been many efforts to promote ""car reduced"" communities. In Source 2, Paris shows that they have made improvements in banning driving on certain days of the week due to smog. That smog cleared enough for the people to drive on days they were allowed to.

The second benefit to limiting car usage would be that people find more alternative ways of transportation easier and they are happier. ""When i had a car iwas always tense. Im much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Many people expressed that other ways of transportation like biking or walking are much easier. In Source 3, it explains that Colombia has car-free days where they skate, bike, hike, or take buses instead. ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

In Source 4, it says that because of other ways of transportation are easier and cheaper, ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year."" It goes on to explain that ""Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway."" As more people become jobless, they find that taking buses or walking is much easier. That could be an advantage because Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company laid out a plan where cities in which ""pedstrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""

In conclusion, there are many ways in limiting car usage can be benefical such as with the enviroment, to the people, and it can change in the way this world operates. Living a car-free life would soon be very desirable in this world soon.                     ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A05F72A3D4A2,"Automobiles are to blame for a large amount of pollution on this planet. Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Greenhouse gas is slowly chipping away at Earths ozone layer and if the ozone layer went away human life itself will soon start to go away. So it will probably be smart to limit car usage in every continent and major inustrialized areas so we can help stop the the destruction of the ozone. Or at the very least slow it down so generations to come have a stable environment to live in rather than wearing some sort of gas mask or philter over their face to breathe, like Beijing, Chinas population has to. The countries who are taking advantage of limiting car usage are being smart because it would be an advantage to help stop the slow but inevitable destruction of our Earth.

Several different areas around the world are occasionally taking place in a ban against car usage that last a few days or so depending on the country and the state at which it is in. An example of this event is in Paris, they had reached a near-record of polluting smog that could have rivaled the smog of Beijing, China. On a Monday motorists with even numbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. The smog had cleared enough that Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday. Even though typically Paris has more smog than other European capitals, that week it had been a little more polluted than normal. Since they took the action of enforcing a ban it helped them control the pollution and they found out the advantage of limiting car usage.

Another example of a country using this advantage over pollution is Bogota, Columbia. Millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog any violaters were faced with a fine. The day without cars was part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1900s. So far it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most in any Latin American city. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; old worn out sidewalks have been replaced with smooth sidewalks; and many new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. The no car day is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. All this occured since the city of Bogota, Columbia took advantage of limiting car usage and wanting to take action against the growing pollution epidemic.

Auto mobiles are still to blame for the large amount of pollution on this planent, but if more countries were to limit car usage then the rising pollution infection that has plagued our planet would slowly cease to endanger our world. Many countries have already started to take advantage of limiting car usage and decreasing the pollutuion level in their home environment like in Bogota, Columbia. The car free day that Bogota has started, is set to spread to other countries so they too can take advantage of limiting car usage and saving the planet. Therefore the countries who are taking action against pollution are being examples to the other countries in the hope of rubbing off their intentions and spreading this idea of limiting automobiles and lowering the pollution levels to save the planet.

In

In German Suberb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a city has already adapted to the idea of a car free, or a non-car dependant city. They did so by having ""only two places to park- large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" This limit of parking space can cause drivers to just stop trying to drive, becauuse why bother if there is limited to no places to put the car? This change allows for people to be less stressed, and when one doesn't have a car, there's less of a rush to get somewhere because the ability to rush is gone. There's also the need of less polution that causes car usage to go down. ""And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" The above quote by Elisabeth Rosenthal proves that something must be done to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing car usage can do so. Vauban finds is useful, why doesn't everyone?

Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, cars were slowly banned in order to clear the air, sort of like when one puts their body through a detox. When that ended up helping, more cars were banned, and this led to the realization that cars were bad, more or less. The enviropnment needs less cars, which means we need to be less dependant on cars for everything, because soon this so- called need for cars is going to leave us gasping for breath, and that is not a good thing. ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters."" The usage of diesel, which is ultimately the usage of cars, is leading to a ""blanket"" of air trapping the car emissions, causing pollution. The pollution is so dangerous to have just sitting there, waiting to be breathed in and choked on. After realizing that the ban of cars has been helpful for the environment, shouldn't everyone else realize it is advantagous too?

The sooner the human race stops depending on cars, the sooner the human race will be able to breath and think carefully and safely again. Everyone is aware pollution is a problem, will continue to complain about it, but then will also continue to fuel the problem, which is quite ironic isn't it? Cars are not worth losing our ability to breath, and if we realize that, then maybe we will be able to breath and see clearly again.                                         ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
37128E3F3AD3,"This was what the 21st Century looks like.. People using cars more and more every single day to the point where half of us don't even want to take a lovely little stroll through the garden, over the bridge, and straight to the tree house. Nope. Nothing like that anymore. Ever since cars were created, it's given us a form to transport easier, but it's taken out a lot from the people. Among all the things they could be doing, they choose to sit in the car all day. Not anymore. There are people in different countries and states who are making a wonderful change in the world.

It all starts in Vauban, Germany. People have no cars within their non-existant garages and people are paying thousands of dollars to park their car. Why? Well, consider it as a way to help the environment. Places like Germany, France, and small sections of the United States have banned cars because of the greenhouse gas emissions.  With a law that prevents cars, the states and countries can clean up the air quicker without any more polluting gas entering to make things worse.

One of the greatest advantages for car bans is that there are less accidents. With rarely any cars on the streets, it prevents people from dying in car accidents or hit-and-runs. With this, we'll have less deaths and more people coming home safely to their families.

With the majority of the population gaining weight from no workouts, car bans puts us in a different track. Whenever we need to go somewhere, we do it with a bit of exercise. Walking, biking, all that sweet jazz. We can become a better generation with just a little push and removal of something that restricts us from certain things. We've taken advangtage of cars by not putting so much work into getting the strength we need to keep us walking for more than just 20 minutes before our legs grow tired.

The future is close, but we've still got a long road ahead of us to get to our goal. To cross that road, we've thrown all the cars off to the side and we'll walk, we'll ride our bikes, we'll dance our way over the other side. Whatever it takes to get to the other side, we'll take it.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
6C5AA9A68DF3,"Most people own cars and rarely do you see anyonw without one. Well, there are many benifts that come with limiting car useage. For starters one would be much happier without a car. Because when you have a car your always tense. And that can come from almost anything when your driveing.

Another great benfit of limiting your car useage is beacause of traffic. owning a car, your often stuck in between cars waiting for lights to change or for people to move. But if you limit your car useage then you won't be stuck in traffic jams. You can move from point A to point B in no time.

Again there are so many things that can benfit you from less car useage. For example in Paris they ban driveing because of ""smog"". Limiting your car useage will also lower the pollutiion in the air. Like I've been saying all this time car useage is something that only causes stress arond the world.

There is more than just these three things that benfit you if you use less car useage. You can also lose wait if your walking all the time. Its a great way to burn those calories if thats what you want.

You will also be super healthy because you will excerciseing alot more than you would with a car. Your body is moving and thats all that really matters. There are so many advaanges of no car useage.

Another thing that is that your body will become stronger. Because since you will be walking or running to where ever you need to go you will improve your strength. You won't be weak or like a noodle but muscle will be built.

So like I've been saying there are so many advanages to less car useage. Mostly becaus ein the end you will be happier, calm, and well excrised. Something that is alot easier than what we may have thought.

Those are the advages of having less car useage. because its more benfital than what everybeody may think.     ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F3580A6BAFA8,"Almost everyone owns a car because people are traveling constantly to get from point A to point B. No matter who it may be, that person at some point in their lives needs some way to get around. Everyday people need to either go to the store, pick up their kids, go to work, go to school, you name it. That doesn't mean that owning a car is a necessity, all around the world many people are trying to cut down and limit their car usage by having a whole lot of other options. There are buses, people can car pool, walk, skate, bike, and many more. People are coming to the conclusion that if we, as a whole, decide to start cutting down on our usage of cars it can benefit the way we live.

Lots of people actually don't mind not having a car just yet. Most teenagers do want to get their license and a car but there's so much other things they need to focus on. It really is not a priority for them because they have school, work, plus if they do need to get somewhere they can always take the bus and get a ride from a friend (Source 4). In Germany, there is a city by the name of Vauban, that is known to be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life (Source 1). Vauban's goal and idea, which is to cut down on cars for a better living, has made it'a way around the world, so that other states and countries can aspire to do the same and little by little we could have a world that is not so dependent on cars. The idea of using cars, for some, it causes them stress and they're always tense, not using a car makes them happier, as stated by Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two (Source 1). The stress aspect of this could be due to the fact that in the most recent years, the percentage of car crashes and accidents have gone up. Many people abhor the idea of using cars because they have been in an terible accident themselves or someone close to them. Also, it can even just be all the traffic jams that occur during rush hour, which makes people late and accidents do happen. For example in Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to their designated location, to leave the streets due to traffic jams (Source 3). Since they knew that lots of their citizens were deciding not to use cars they started making uneven, pitted sidewalks into nice, smooth, replaced ones for them (Source 3).

Another reason why people want to limit their usage on cars is because of all the pollution cars create. Passenger cars are rsponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Source 1). Not many people think about the effects of air pollution like smog, but it is a big deal. Since people don't think about it often, there is no way for the majority of us to try and find a solution to put into action to stop it or help it go down. In Paris, there was a partial driving ban to clear the air around the city (Source 2). Paris' partial ban was their idea to try and make their city a better place. With the ban being enforced and put into play there  were about 4,000 drivers fined (Source 2). It turns out that since the driving ban was made the congestion, car traffic, had gone down 60 percent in the capital of France, just after five days of less smog pollution and Paris is typically known to have more smog than any other European capitals (Source 2). This goes to show, that slowly people are actually becoming aware of what's going on and they actually care enought to try and make things better.

All in all, there are many ways to try and cut down on our car usage for the better. It can be anything from not buying as many cars, to deciding to not use cars at all and deciding to walk, skate, and bike, etc. Not only will limiting our car usage as a whole stop traffic jams, car accidents, air pollution, and more, it will help to benefit our lives for the better whether or not people want to believe it. If things keep going from here, and more and more decide that less car usage is better than over a time span of let's say 20-30 years, there could be a lot less dangerous things occuring in our lives.

37CD93590711,"Since the 1900's cars have been an integral part of our lives. It seems everyone has one nowadays. But this overuse of cars is starting to have a negative effect on our enviroment and is causing mass traffic jams that put cities on halt. We as a society must start limiting our car usage to help save our enviroment and to stop traffic jams that do not let the city run smoothly.

Cars were and still are one of the best inventions man has ever made, so it is understandable why people would have such a hard time letting go of something that is so useful. But one must understand that although the car is useful it is also hurting other things, whether it be inadvertant or not. Cars have always been bad on the enviroment, now so more then ever. According to

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars passenger cars are responsible for 12 % of greeenhouse emissions and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. This shows that we as a society are one the of the main reasons why are enviroment is crumbling around us. These greenhouse emissions and mass pollution by cars are hurting the enviroment whether we want it to or not. Everybody must take a look at these numbers and see the negative effect they are having on the enviroment and realize that by simply not using a car they can help save the enviroment. Another example of the bad effects cars have on the enviroment can be found in the article

Paris bans driving due to smog.

In the article it talks about how Paris had to enforce a driving ban due to the amount of pollution in the air from cars. The fact that a driving ban had to be implemented to stop pollution is absolutley ridiculous. This alone should show people that refuse to see the negative effects they are having on the enviroment around them that car usage should and must be cut down. By simply cutting down our usage of cars we as people can help save the enviroment. Who would not want to be a part of that?

Cars have always been viewed at as the best mode of transportation. Everyone believes that their car can always get them to the place they need the fastest. But what most people do not think about is the mass traffic jams in cities that the usage of cars can cause. If people simply cut down there car usage and try out other forms of transportation it actually could get them to the destination they want the quickest. An example of this can be found in the article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.

In the article it says when they banned cars for the day the huge traffic jams in the city suddenly went away. This allowed people on bikes and buses to actually get around quicker than they usually could with their cars. So by not using cars people actually got around to the places they needed to be due to the lack of traffic jams in the city.

The amount of cars driven on the road per day has risen to an astronomical number over the years. Although cars may be efficient they also have many harmful effects. Two of the worst are the effect they have on the enviroment and the mass traffic jams they cause. We as a society must recognize that by cutting down our usage of cars we can actually have a positive effect on our enviroment while also allowing ourselves the ability to bring traffic jams to a minimum.

Also the Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in france , compared to a 5.3 percant average of the diesel engimes in the rest of western Europe , according to reuters. Still however indicates The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog and the Violators faced $25 fines. The Article also states As April  2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below th peak and equal to where the country was in januart 1995.

One Reason, Fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage are going out of controll because in the article Ingerman Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars states Automoblies are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle- class familes From chicago to shanghai tens to make their homes and that , experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpies for the passenger car are responsibe for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in sime car intensive areas in the united states. But in paris bans driving dur to smog takes about while exceptions were made for plug in cars,hybrids, and carrying three or more passengers.

Another Reason,fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage are going out of control because it incates President obamas ambitions goals to curb the united staes greenhouse gas emissons, unveiled lastweek, will get a fortuitios assist from an incipient shoft in american behavior also recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each years goes by. the days without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in bogotoa in the mid 1990s.

DFEF1ADEC61E,"There are many advantages to limiting the number of cars on the roads. There are many reasons to not drive as much but there is still a lot of driving. People are taking action in decreasing the number of cars still being driven. There needs to be a smaller number of drivers. Driving isn't a life or death deal, we lived witout it for tens of thousands of years,

There are a lot of reasons to decrease driving numbers. The most important reasons in my opinion are environmental issues. There are so many gases produced my cars such as carbon monoxide that hurt our atmosphere. The air has been filled with pollutants that are devestating our whole world. Too much exposure to certain gases can be fatal. Driving is not worth polluting and hurting our atmosphere.

Many places have alredy taken action in reducing the number of cars on the road. Vuban, a German suburb, has banned the use of personal vehicles. As a result, 70 percent of families who reside in Vuban do not own a car. They simply walk or ride bikes everywhere with only a few buses to transport the citizens. Heidrun Walter says ""When I had a  car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Paris did an experiment with not letting even-number plated cars had to find another way of transportation for one day and odd-number plated cars do the same the next day. Each violator was fined 22 euros or $31. They repeated that cycle for about a week. The amount of smog decreased drastically. Even Bogata has their ""Day Without Cars."" They've held the event for 3 years straight. Violators faced a $25 fine. In result of that, two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined the event.

In the past couple of years there haven't been that many new drivers joining the crowd. A study has shown that there has been a 23% decrease of new drivers between 2001 and 2009. I guess that people don't have the need to drive everywhere now. The number of miles driven was peaked in 2005. Ever since then people have been driving less. We are now at the same number of miles driven as in 1995. People also haven't been buying new cars as often as they used to.

All in all, there are many advantages of driving less. There isn't as much of pollution being created. If we stay on the same track, we can stop polluting the earth with as many harsh gases and chemicals. There would be more healthy wildlife as well.

Having no cars is a great solution to having no traffic and less polution. Without cars our air would be fresh and it wouldnt take as long to get from place to place.

Although many people have cars and drive them regularly it is not always the best choice. Having no cars would be a drastic change to society but it would also be a major change in the way we travel and breathe in air. In Vauban, Germany the residents have gave up on cars. The streets are car free. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there"". This piece from the text tells us that hardly any one is driving a car their. One of the residents says ""When I had a car I was always tense.

In the article ""In German suburb, life goes on without cars"" it says that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". That is insane to think that much is released, but its happening daily from everyday car users. The environmental agency is trying to promote car reduced communities. Polution got so bad in Paris that they had to enforce a partial driving ban. After enforcing this the texts says "" congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog"". So limiting their drving in Paris reduced the smog. It is not always the best choiceto drive all the time exspecially if you job or social event your going to isn't far. In ""The end of car culture"" it says "" organize your summer jobs and social life around where you can walk or take public  transportation or car-pool"". By doin those things it will reduced smog and gases getting into the air.

By not having any cars it would reduce polution, give us safer air to breathe, and it would be easier to get from place to place with any traffic. Cars release tons of gases and polute the air. WIthout cars it would reduce that problem. With less cars on the road and mostly public transportation it would be easy to get around instead of getting caught up in traffic.

Cars can cost a pretty penny espically if their new, and many low/middle class family's have trouble keeping up with the bills that come with a car. Car payments alone can run up to $300 a month.

After the peek in 2005 car percheses have droped tramendiously, with less people deciding to get a license.

Not getting you license dosn't mean you cant get around, it just means that you have to find other means of transprotatin. Biking, walking, even riding on your skateboard can get you from point A to point B. Cars are bigining to become obsoliet, not being used in larg suberbs, or highly populated cities. People have started to walk to work and that has a large impact on health. With people having privet cars they dont feel the need to have phisical activity every day. This could be contrabuting to obeasity. With cars being out of mind people are starting to get exersize just by walking to work. Cars have also contrabuted to many deaths all over the world. With new technology comming out many drivers get distracted. Wether its talking on their phones, trying to pick up something thats' dropped in the back seat, or even trying to dig something out of your purse. Not all drivers are a fault tho, many other accidents happen because of padestrians not paying attention. These accidents could be prevented though, by just getting rid of the use of cars.

Passenger cars cause 12% of greenhouse gass admitions in europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the Unites States. If we got rid of most privetly owned cars though, it world bring that pecentige down tramendously.

German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

Heidrun Walter reports ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Her and many others like her in the town of Vauban, Germany have experienced the difference and felt stress go away. The city has banned driveways and home garages, encourging the rule of living ""car-free."" The people rely on public transit, bicycles and their own two legs. While many people are stressing to get a car, the people of the town feel stressed if they have a car. Over half the population sold their cars to move there, and don't regret a thing. In the article titled

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , Andrew Selsky quotes Carlos Arturo Plaza as saying ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress"" as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

Also Carlos Arturo Plaza goes on to say ""[it's a good oppurtinity to] lower air pollution."" People are realizing how many pollutants that cars emitt into the atmosphere. One example place is Paris, known for their terrible smog, has finally done something to clean it up. Robert Duffer wrote in

Paris bans driving due to smog

""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" The law stated even numbered license plates couldn't drive one day, and the other, odd liscense plates couldn't. A little thing like this had a big effect. Duffer then reported ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" Elizabeth Rosenthal in the aritcle

The End of Car Culture showed the idea "" if [these] patterns persists...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" Americans are partically to blame for pollution. Our need for the newest, biggest, best things, has come at a cost, and more than money. Green-house gases are stacking up, and we have to take a stand some time. Rosenthal goes on to describe political leaders are working to fix this too, ""President Obama's abitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions [were] unveiled last week.""

In places already practicing the no car rule, environments have improved; more than pollution wise. Andrew Selsky reported of ""the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" and  ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks."" These two additions of Bogota, Colombia have inspired many people to turn in their keys, and take a hike instead. Not only have these changes made people more happy, but it makes their city more beautiful and they are starting to get outdoors and see it. The author reports that ""municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event [car-free day] and were enthuriastic,"" amung the people visiting was the Mayor of Paraguay's capital city. When more people see the effects, they want to do the same thing. Columbia's one day event has brought about much talk in neighboring towns and even ""two other Colombian cities, Calli and Valledupar, joined the event.""

On the other side of the argument, many car industries are trying to compete with these new ideas and technology. Rosenthal quotes in

The End Of Car Culture

""But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility"" companies with broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"" As humans advance into the ideas of walking, biking, or taking public transportation, car companies strive to become known for things other than cars. They want to be able to sell you things still, even if you don't want or need a car. Later she writes how Bill Ford proposed the fresh idea at the Mobile World Congress that car dealers should ""partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" This long quote simply means having all forms of transportion and the new technology in communications to be one, for the better of the people.

With or without cars, we all are always on the move. Some cities have adapted new ideas to get from place to place, or simply old ideas, being put back into action.

A3612CFF1FB3,"America's great past time might now be just that, in the past. This isn't baseball though, it's the usage of our American vehicles. America was the frontrunner in the invention of cars and has the motor capital of the world in Detroit. However, We've come a long way since the model T and now it is time to move forward into a new, cleaner era of transportation. Cities all across the world have begun the process of minimzing the  usage of private motor vehicles to help stop pollution, and to encourage the use of public transportation. The trend is already upon us in America as well, as a study showed that between 2001 and 2009 the amount of young people driving has decreased by 23 percent. Life without cars has proven beneficial to many cities around the world and it is time to spread to all cities.

First off, limiting the usage of cars will vastly decrease the amount of pollution to our environment.  Recently in Paris, France the government banned all drivers with odd license plates on the first day and all even number plates the second during a two day effort to minimize the smog and pollution of the city. This method proved to be very effectiveas the capital decreased its congestion by 60 percent. This little experiment may seem like a very small accomplishment, but it should serve to be the precedent by which other countries can help stop pollution. If this was done once evry month in major cities around the world it would cause a major decrease in pollution. In the long term it shows people that having their own car isn't always necessary and it is better for the environment to use public tranportation, and or other means to get to one's destination. Bogota, Colombia also participated in their second anual car-free day. This was considered to be a huge success by their mayor and many other South American leaders came to witness it themselves. They were all thouroughly impressed by the programs effectiveness and have thought about implementing it in their own countries.

Secondly, limiting car usage will result in different city layouts that could prove to be more desirable and efficient. In Vauban, Germany they have decided to go nearly car free with 70 percent of residents not owning a car. Car ownership is allowed but the owner of the vehicle must buy a space in a large parking garage for 40,000 dollars. Many of the residents claim that they lived a more stressful life when they owned a car and are now much happier because of the sale of their vehicle. This has started a trend in Europe of small suburban communities going car free to help the environment and their lives. This shift into a car free world is sparking the idea for new city designs to make them denser so mit is easier for people to travel from place to place. Stores can be placed only a walk away on a main street as opposed to a large shopping mall that is along a large highway.

In conclusion, limiting the use of cars and motor vehicles would prove to be extremely benficial for our world and our society. It would help solve the pollution and global warming crisis by limiting the amounts of carbon dioxide we put into our atmosphere. It would also change the shape of our suburban life, making it easier for people to get from place to place while still maintaining their green lifestyle. An Earth without cars becomes an Earth with a more peaceful environment and a healthy atmosphere.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B07768BE9904,"Passenger cars are a standard method of transportation. Although, it is not the most affordable; nor is it easy to maintain. This method carries numerous disadvantages. Consequently, if citizens limit their car usage, it would be very advantageous.

Using an automobile for transportion is unethical for middle-class families. This is evident because Source 1 confirms that near French and Swiss borders, ""...a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" Obviously many families cannot afford to do that because more than half of Vauban's families, (Vauban is a suburb in Germany),  do not own a car and more than half had no choice but to sell theirs to move to Vauban in the first place (Source 1). Even the number of drivers in America has decreased because, during the recession, ""cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars..."" (Source 4). Sociologists also believe within the next few years, the number of car-owners will decrease because ""...the Internet...allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" So as the result of less car ownership, people who stopped using cars because of the recession will find less reason to resume the habit (Source 4). Clearly, limiting automobile use has positive effects because not only the middle-class, but the American population, can't afford cars.

Life without a car, environment-wise, is extremely beneficial. It is proven that automobiles are ""...a huge impediment to current efforts to...reduce greenhouse gas emissions..."" (Source 1). 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe is the result of the use of passenger cars. That percentage is up to 50% in the United States (Source 1). Because those numbers are so high, several advancements are being made to cause the percent to decrease. One example of this is, the Environmental Protection Agency's attempt to ""promote ""car reduced"" communities..."", to protect the nation's and the world's environment (Source 1). There is an environmental dilemma in Paris especially. The city has ""near-record pollution..."" and because they recognize the cause as being cars, they have enforced ""...a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" (Source 2). This ban and other efforts to preserve the environment is advantageous because it is not just an individual's home but the entire population's. Limiting car usage is a small step to making choices that will benefit citizens in the long run.

Having a limit on car use is advantageous. This is made obvious for financial reasons and environment conservation purposes. It is expensive and taxing  to use a car and the environment is better off without automobiles. Cars are not a necessity.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

According to Elisabeth Rosenthal there is a city in germany named VAUNBAN were they can not use cars and if they do use cars then they would have to park it in a place that is very far away and they would have to pay a total of $40,000 to buy that parking space this is better because there are many ways that polution can polute the earth and we do not want that to happen.

Also there are many places that are doing car free days in which the citizens must not use there cars and ride the busses to work so that there izs less polution. this is good because there will be a major decrease in polution which is good for the earth and also good for the soul.

In conclusion i think that there should be less places for cars to drive and polute the world and mother earth and you should to.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
7C8B867A0A1A,"Cars, they help us get from point A to B in a shorter amount of time, but at what cost. Cars are a large source of stress, produce large ammounts of pollution, and seem, even now, to be going out of style. Cars are a luxury, not a necessity, and now they might not even be as usefull. More and more people are putting down the car keys and choosing instead to take a bike or bus. Cars are just too stressful to be a necesity.

In Vauban, Germany, many people are giving up engines. According to the

New York Times,

""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars,"" showing that life can go on efficiently even without a car. Life might actually improve without those money eating tanks. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" says Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. This car free philosophy is even becoming a trend! There are hundreds of groups in the United States promoting communities that are more independent of cars, called ""car reduced"" communities. But stress isn't the only thing cars produce. Cars are huge contributers to pollution, and reducing car usage would greatly benifit the enviornment.

Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent is some car-intensive areas in the united states, acording to the

New York Times . Paris actually enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of near-record pollution. The ban was enforced with a $31 fine. Even with 4,000 drivers fined, congestion was down 60 percent and the smog cleared enough that the ban could be lifted the next day. Using more enviornmentally inclined sources of transportation will deffinetly help leave a cleaner planet for future generations, and the generations already here. Cars are conveinient for short term gratification, but the long term effects might devastate the enviornment. Cars are not needed, and might not even be prefered for much longer.

A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 in the united states. Bogota, Colombia even becan a ""car-free day"" in wich all cars, besides busses and taxis, are banned in this capital city of 7 million for an entire day. Violaters of this ban are fined $25. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Plaza. This event is even starting to spread. For the first time two other Colombian cities have joined the event. Using cars is becoming less and less common, and it's a trend the enviornment can enjoy.

In conclusion, cars are a hiderance. Cars are stressful and cumbersome objects, getting rid of them would help reduce stress in the population. Cars are high contributers to pollution, creating smog and causing problems. Also, cars are a comodity that is being used less and less. People are putting down the car keys and picking up a bike. So why not join the trend?    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D5262241B8B7,"In the modern world, it's uncommon to see someone without a car. Most people own at least one, and use it frequently. In America, suburban areas have few public transport options available making it difficult to get to work or to a store without using a car. However, cars are a massive source of greenhouse gas emissions. Not only that, car accidents have led to millions of injuries and deaths. While companies are working to procure cleaner, safer car models all the time, other countries are taking actions to lower the number of people using personal automobiles every day.

In Vauban, Germany, cars are actually banned. This town is much cleaner, and its residents are all happy with the rule. Stores and buildings are placed closer together, making them accessable to more people. Many people bike and walk to the places they need to be. Not only is it good exercise, it cuts down on the pollution going into the air and destroying the ozone. By not driving, no one has to be plagued by the worries of speeding, not going fast enough, getting hit, hitting someone else, or paying for gas. The town, finished in 2006, has done well so far. Germany isn't the only country interested in lowering car usage, though.

Recently, Paris was forced to enact a partial driving ban due to smog levels getting out of control. For a while, they were on the same level with Beijing, which is infamous for its horrible pollution. Car emissions have been, as Elisabeth Rosenthal put it in her article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", ""choking cities"". Paris' solution to the issue was forbidding cars with even-numbered lisence plates to be driven one day, and then odd-numbered ones the next. Many people were unhappy with this, but the smog quickly cleared up to acceptable levels.

Meanwhile in Colombia, Bogota has a ban on cars as well, though it only lasts for one day a year. Contrasting with the reactions of the French, the citizens of the capitol willingly participate and use other means of transportation. Because of this, the usual traffic jams and wrecks are drastically minimized. This day without cars promotes public transport and lowering smog levels in big cities. Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman, vocalized his opinion of the event, saying that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The car-free day has led to plenty of changes in the city, such as safer, better sidewalks, less traffic, and more condensed stores and restaurants that are closer together.

While it's definitely more common to see someone driving a car than biking to work, steps have been made towards a cleaner future that doesn't involve nearly so many cars. More Americans are limiting their car usage when they can every year. With cell phones and the Internet, it's now much easier to make car pooling arrangements, as well as interacting through the internet without having to leave and drive somewhere. The younger generation is becoming less concerned with getting a license, and is taking up organizing their lives around not having a car. With the recession, cars are becoming harder to afford and maintain. If people can get around those costs, they will. By limiting car usage, pollution levels are dropping, as well as the casualties that come with reckless driving.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
7A1B08E49014,"Experiments and new ideas are paving the way for new cultural changes. Cars are emitting more and more pollution every year. Researchers and studies show that by limiting the use of motorized vehicles the harmful gases trapped inside the ozone will eventually diminsh.

In Vauban, Germany they have given up theirs cars. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in ths experimental new district"" says Elisabeth Rosenthal. According to the article, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not even own a car, and 57 percent sold their car just so they could move into this suburban lifestyle.

Paris, France decided to give this experiment a try. After five days France recorded that 60 percent of the capitals congestion went down. This has made more clear skys and easier breathing habits for residents.

The United States is now thinking about trying this new change. Researches say that since the recession not many people are buying cars now a days. They dont have a need for them as much as they did before. Numbers have been going down steadily since 2005. ""If this pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emmsions and the environment"" says Elsiabeth Rosenthal.

With this new cultural shift, it could be better for people, industries and most importantly the air we breath!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
37412EBFDB36,"The advantages of limiting car usage are that it saves time, conserves resources, lower emmisions and improve safety. Limited car usage will have a tremendous effect on our planet in a great way. It would help conserve our resources such as fuel. In the passage ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer paragraph sixteen it states that France has a tax policy tha favors the fuel diesel. Diesels make up sixty-seven precent of vehicles in France. Due to France's favor of diesel the carbon that is emitted into the air has created smog. Paris typically has more smog than any other European capitals because of these such emissions. france saw his as a problem in need of serious correcting. In attempts to reduce the smog the French had a ban on motor vehicles with few exceptions; sure enough the smog cleared and the ruling French party rescind the ban.

Drastic efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailipes in Vauban, Germany have been put into order by creating an up-scale community that is ""Car-free"". As a result seventy precent of Vauban's families do not own cars. As said in paragraph eight of the passage ""In german suburb, Life goes on without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""emissions from n increasing number of private carsowned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" Sociologists believe this concept of car-free enviorments will have beneficial implicatins for carbon emissions and the enviorment, since transportations is the second largest source of emissions. there are critics such as the car industry that counter this idea because it could have negative implications on their business. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already renaming themselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range other than the personl vehicle.

Thousands upon thousands die in car acciddents every year. Cars are lethal weapons that caue misery to many involved or anyone who knew of someone in a car crashes. ""When i had a car i was always tense. im much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer that is living in a Car-free district. France even joined the trend by banning cars and making public transit free admission Monday-Friday.

B462479DEB37,"Imagine a world where everything you need is within walking distance. This is what our society could become if we stop relying on cars. If we stop using cars we could largely cut down on greenhouse gasses and polluted air. No cars means no stress of dumb drivers, DUI, and car-related deaths.

First, if we stop using cars as the main mode of transportation, buildings would be closer to homes to accomodate people walking to them instead of driving. This saves money because you don't need a car, gas, or insurance. A closer and more condensed society means communities could be formed where everyone knows everyone, like back in the old days with city-states and villages.

Secondly, cutting back on cars means cutting back on air pollution and greenhouse gasses. Less greenhouse gasses equals a cooler and more healthy earth. Air pollution is a big problem in places like china, france, and some european countries. If we get rid of most cars, the air there will be much more pleasant and breathable. The sky would also become more clear.

In conclusion, cutting back on cars could be beneficial to the whole world, communites would be formed, everything you need would be in walking distance, there would be less car related deaths, and greenhouse gasses and air pollution would greatly decrease, making the earth and its people healthier.

276048EF9F9A,"All arround the world countries are making an effort to reduce their use of cars to benefit the Earth. There are many benefits to reducing car usage all arround the world. Not only does it reduce polution but it also promotes getting out and being active. Vauban, Germany is a car-free community where the voices of a few children can drown out the hum of a car. Bogota, Colombia has established a program called the Day Without Cars  where they promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. This promotes people to use transportation that runs on man-power like bikes or even walking. This also falls into the fact that as people use bikes and walk they begin to get more exercize. Although most of the time it is more convinent to use cars to get to a location some places have stores within walking distance so there would be no need for the use of a car.

Pollution has been a problem arround the world for many years, each country is responsible for their own share of polluting the Earth and cars are part of the problem. Cars alone are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse emissions in America, if Americans made an effort to reduce that number by just half it would mean a world of difference to that country. It would result in America being less responsible for the pollution of the Earth and a safer environment for the citizens. However, other countries have been taking action to help the environment, efforts were thrown towards cities to make it more beneficial to walk and they are now settoing their sights on suburbs. Vauban, Germany is acommunity where there is an advanced experiment that focuses on eliminating the use of cars. Their efforts have proven quite successful as only 30 percent of the families that live there own cars and almost 60 percent of the residents sold their car in order to live there. Bogota, Colombia has created a day where everyone is encouraged to use bikes and walk instead of using fuel-burning cars, those who chose not to participate in this event were fined $25. The effort that was put into the making of thisevent has inspired other countries like Cali and Valledupar to do the same. This shows that people are making an effort to move torards environmentally beneficial habits that cause a chain reaction.

Another benefit to reducing the use of cars is that people will get more exercize than they usually do. For some people the most exercize they get is the walk from the couch to the fridge or the 30 minutes when they are at the mall. Unfortunatley, people do not walk arround the mall every day for their daily exercize routine. Decreasing the use of cars would promote people to use their physical energy in order to get to their desired destination. This would also result in having stores and other services of use closer by so people will be more willing to walk to them.

8B696D4A84A0,"The majority of Americans have the luxury of owning a car. A car of course, seems like a useful innovation. It gets you places quickly and efficently, and is easier than walking. Yet so many people drive cars that the roads get congested and clogged easily as the cars just idle in the road waiting for the traffic jam to loosen up. Car usage causes the enviroment to decline and an increase in air poulltion, it would be a great idea to lower car usage since it is so detrimental to the health of the enviroment and the health of the populace.

An advantage to reducing car usage is a more benifical enviroment and a better overall health standard. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some ... areas in the United States."" (Source 1). Personal cars directly contribute to greenhouse gas enissions and by cutting down personal car usage and encouraging the use of car pooling and public transportation we can decrease greenhouse gas emmmisions. Also walking and biking to your destination instead of driving helps encourage healthy living and habits as well as exercise.

Cars also cause poulltion and smog to hang over cities causing the air to be full of harmful chemicals, endagering peoples health and also causing a rise in asthma for the populace that lives inside the city. In places like Beijing,China smog and poulltion from cars cause the air to be so foggy and dirty that you cannot even see the sky. ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""(Source 2). When Paris was accosted by the same problem they solved it by a temporary ban on driving to clear the air. Without so many people driving cars we wouldn't have these many issues with smog and it's effect on the enviroment. With less car usage smog and pollution would drop.

Driving not only creates an issue with air pollution but also with water pollution and the contamination of the earth. Cars run on gasoline, a fossil fuel. Which is brought up from underground by drilling into the earth. Fracking often has a negative effect on the earth, often causing oil spills into the ocean or earth. The effect of the oil spill is  pollution and mass death of wildlife in that area. By using alternative methods of transportation such as trains,buses,taxis,subways, walking and biking we reduce the amount of gas used and also the amount of car emmissons released into the air. Cars guzzle gasoline and this causes a huge need for fossil fuel, by using cars less we lessen the need for gasoline.

Many people agree with the statment  that without cars their lives are easier and less stressful due to the fact that they no longer have to worry about traffic jams and car crashes as well as any other dangerous event that can happen while driving. This excerpt from the third source, shows a man's reply to the event Day Without Cars that takes place in Bogota,Colombia once a year. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.""(Source 3). This excerpt only furthers my point that less car usage causes people to be more calm and less worried or stressed. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter"" (Source 1). This quote from source 1 which discusses a suburb in Germany that is car-free. This blurb shows another example of someone who became happier without a car. Another advantage to reducing car usage is less stress.

Also to some people a car is just a backup for when public transportation falls through. ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transporation or car-pool with friends."" (Source 4) By reducing uneeded car usage we cause a more effiecent society less dependent on cars and more dependent on better types of alternative transportation. ""'A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART [type of public transport] doesn't work.'"" (Source 4). By improving public transport we reduce car usage which improves the enviroment and quality of life.

Less car usage will help the enviroment as well as lower stress. ""Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisons."" (Source 4). By eliminating uneeded car usage and introducing more public transportation and alternate means of transport we will be eliminating one of the greatest causes of greenhouse gas emissions in America. The advantages of eliminating car usage is less pollution, healthier living and a less stressful life.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Robert say ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" This also means that the people were starting to notice that the smog is going down and decisded that it wouls be better if there are no more cars on the street anymore.

Now in the story ""The end of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal its is talking about how the President is seeing how Americans are buying less cars, driving licenses and getting less licenses as each year goes by.

It is the birthplace of the ModelT;the home of Detroit; thep lace where Wilson Pickett immprtalized ""Mustang Sally"".""

Let them want to walk to where ever they need to go to evey day and not have to force them to do something you tell them do to and if they dont you will fine them.

In Colombia millions of people are all ready used to the no car law. They have taken it in like its nothing.

We constantly try to make the world safer and go green by recycling, planting trees, clean up parks and beaches, drive hybrid and electric cars but we need to do something different like drive less and walk, carpool, or ride bicycles to get where we want to go. It will make the world more efficient , peaceful, and reduce stress among the people who wake up late and rush to school or their jobs.

As you inhale and exhale, your body takes in the air around you, which is filled with bacteria, cigeratte smoke, gases, oxygen, etc. We would make the world cleaner if gas wasn't polluted in the air. The gases from vehicles destory our trees which provide oxygen to us human beings. You wouldn't want people to get lung cancers and lung diseases from them everytime someone tries to take a walk outside just to enjoy the view of mother earth. Driving less will allow the air that we breath to be safer and less polluted. So, what happens if people drive more and forget about health? Well, eventually our ozone that protects us from the sun will break down and it will cause something that is called ""the greenhouse effect"".

On the daily basis, there are car accidents and non survivors of a crash. It breaks my heart to see a family die because of a drunk driver on the news or someone crossing the street is hit by a car and the driver drives off as if nothing has happened. If people drove less, the rate of car accidents and deaths  by hit and runs will decrease. When people drive they are unprepared for anything that might happen under the wheel, that is why seatbelts and airbags were created but a seatbelt and an airbag may not be reliable when a car is flipped over and a person cannot get out of the car because their seatbelt is locked and sometimes the car may explode. You will have no worries if you drive less and walk or ride a bicycle more often.

Being happy and in peace is better than being stressed out. Driving less will take away stress from your daily routine. Going for a walk or riding your bike around the neighborhood will make you feel revied and you'll get to enjoy the pulchritudinous nature around you. You'll even want to ask yourself ""where has this been all my life""?...God has created the world so precious and I know he took his time making it. People take hikes, vacations, and trips to the beach to enjoy the views of world. It would be best to take a break from driving.

You can get plenty of exercise if you walk to work or school instead of driving. Think of all the obese and lazy people that do nothing for themselves and drive around thinking that it is okay to not exercise at all. Walking or riding a bike will decrease stress, and your chances of getting heart disease. Most people in America die from heart disease and cancer. Just by taking a walk or a ride on a bicycle, you may save yourself from the ugly illnesses.

Finally, the advantages of limiting car usage are allowing the air to be safer and less polluted, decreases car accidents, takes away stress, and allows you to get the exercise you need everyday. If people take time out of their day just to take a walk they will be wanting more and better things for the earth.

All the people of the world will be proud to say that they've done something great to save what we've got left.

Driving is a privlege not a priority. So, the next time you decide to drive think of all the good things you'll be able to experience and how much you'll be saving the world from disaster.                      ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
36637B868F5B,"Since remotely times, the man had look for some way to make his life easier, since primitive hunting weapons, to carriages. The carriages were pulled by horses mostly, and on those times, the most that those animals could do for contamination was pooping but the owners had people to clean for it as well as someone who took care of it. While the times had change, the transportation media has too as well with the cars; which it actually result to be a doble sided blade contaminating with smog.

In Paris the government has banned driving due to smog, the smog has caused a huge impact on this city, giving to it cooler nights and warmer days, many habitants blame Diesel fuel, but it does not matter which fuel you would use, it would burn and produce smog anyways. On the other hand, Vauban, Germany, is offering a new life style that many people has decided to adopt; the suburbian comunity has no cars at the streets, people there does not own a car because they do not need it, the public transportation works very well, so it is not a primary need. They can live perfectly without cars, then they are not that necesary. Many people even sell their cars in order to move to Vauban, and had said that their lifes are so much less stressful than when they did own a car. Mothers can let their childrens to play in the streets without thinking that a car is going to kill them, and kids can let go technology if their moms want them to play outside; most of the kids are so attached to technology because it is a way that parents have to keep them away from the streets. Maybe these changes like in Germany were too radicals, but it can start by a day a year like in Bogotá, Colombia where once a year people take a car-free day, being buses and taxis the only ones allowed to produce smog, the violators are charged with 25 dollars fines. Even in the U.S., from 2003 to 2009 young people driving decreased a 23%, young people are considered the most dangerous driving people. There is so much for young people to do that they are not focused on driving, this could be the beginning of a new era, in April 2013 the number of miles per person was equal that in 1995 where the cars where less than right now. There it is even a program in New York promoting car-pooling!

But for example, here in Florida the public transportation is not that good, you actually need a car that drives  you to the bus station and then take the bus; a bus that will let you on a train station, that train station will offer you a ride of an hour to another bus that takes about half an hour to get to your job (if you live in Homestead and work in Miami). That is about three hours just arriving to your job, every day for five days in a row; that is about thirty hours a week, just to get to your job! But if you have a car, those three hours now are one hour, which seems reasonable (and it is still a lot!). If someone lives at Homestead and needs to do something (which is generally at downtown Miami or Doral) you would have to dedicate a whole day just doing it, if you are going in car because the distance between cities are ridiculous, can you imagine if not having it? For doing something you would have to take two days and do it by parts or wake up at the very morning when it is still dark so you can complete everything by the afternoon. So defenetly the car is a primary need.

Analyzing the life style that people at Vauban have, they are less stressed than the average person who owns a car; people starts to be more social with their neighbors because they have to walk everywhere and the faces are the same, so they actually get to know each other. They also got the benefit of a cleaner enviroment because they do not have the daily doses of smog that someone living in a city would have; cars cause the 12% of the contamination in Europe and more than a 50% in the United States. That is a problem that Paris maybe would not be facing right now if they had payed attention to contamination levels. Since World War II, science has been centered on developing new and better cars; can you imagine what would we have right now if some other would center the science in medicicne or something else?. In the United States an 80% of the budget goes to highways while just a 20% goes to public transportation. But, how can people in Bogotá or Vauben survive without cars? The distance between the comercial and suburban areas are close enough so a bus could take you there (just one bus). Defenetly, making the change would be hard due to our attachment to our cars, but little by little we can change or life style.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

3E94ADF5CA64,"In America, cars are concidered an important necessity to life. Cars get people from one place to another in a significantly shorter amount of time than walking from place to place. Cars, however, aren't as beneficial as they may seem. Motorized vehicles are harmful to the environment and ourselves because they release an immense amount of greenhouse gases and force other countries around the world to ban the use of cars to restrict smog.

Firstly, the amount of greenhouse gases released in the United States alone is relatively high compared to more suburban countries. In some large U.S. cities, cars produce approximately 50% of the total greenhouse gases, according to ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"". That percent is extremely high compared to Europe where cars produce only about 12% of the greenhouse gases. Beijing, however, is more polluted than the United States and is said to be the most polluted city in the world. France, on the other hand, has made it a law where certain cars are forbidded to drive on certain days. As a result of France's action, congestion decreased by 60 percent in the capital of Paris. If the United States took a step forward to reduce pollution, the air quality would benefit rather than gradually decline.

Furthermore, other countries around the world have made an effort to reduce pollution. In Bogota, Colombia, there is one day a year where cars are banned with only buses and taxis permitted. The day called ""Day Without Cars"" is promoting alternative transportation and is reducing smog. Vauban, France, for example, is a suburban city where cars are forbidden. Ownership is allowed, however, there are only two places to park and the cost is $40,000 just for a space to park. The people in Vauban tend to be happier and less tense, according to Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. Paris is a more urban city than Vauban but has still made efforts to benefit air quality. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were demanded to leave their cars at home on Monday. Motorists with odd-numbered license plates left their vehicles home on Tuesday. Congestion decreased by 60 percent. Other countries around the world have put an effort to reduce pollution from motorized vehicles and the results were positive environmentally and mentally.

The use of automobiles greatly impacts the environment and society negatively. Greenhouse gases pollute the air and driving cars produces mental instability in some cases. Other countries such as Colombia and France have taken a step to reduce pollution and since the cars in the United States produce 50% of the greenhouse gases, the U.S. should concider following Colombia and France's ideas.          ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

0D4A03072F9F,"limiting how much the car is used could reduce the green house gas emissions, smog would reduce, and in germany, it will save money.

to begin with, green house gas emissions are produced by cars being used and the carbon dioxide is not leaving the atmosphere. when the sun shines light into earth's atmosphere, the heat from the light rays can not escape the atmosphere because of all the carbon dioxide. this causes problems in the polar regions. due to the increasing temoatures, the ice is melting more and quicker. this causes sea levels to rise and in teh antartica region, animals can not cross the ice fast enough to get to where their food is leaving them stranded to starve. if the usage of cars was reduced, the green house effect wouldn't affect people or animals as much.

In paris , cars are being banned due to too much smog in the area. ""after five-days of intensiving smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, chins, which is known as the most polluted cities in the world. cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions."" it can also make it difficult to breathe.

the sorce ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" talks about how in Vauban, Germany 70 percent of families do not own cars. the cause of this is because of how much it cost to own a car. One has to pay $40,000 with the cost of their house to park in a parking garage. it is cheaper to just pay for public transportation or walk. not only is it cheaper, but it reduces the green house effect.

Cars are used way to often by many people who don't even need it most the time. If you do your part and limit car usage only good things will come to the world. Limiting car usage in todays' environment sounds like a difficult thing to do since people work, go to school, etc. but in reality limiting car usage is saving the environment around us and by saving the environment you are saving yourself.

The high number of car usage is polluting our environment in numerous ways due to the smog it creates that corrupts the air. Sometimes it takes seeing what one is doing to stop and think about how they are affecting it. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city ( Source 2, Paragraph 10)"". You can see that because of the increased pollution in Paris they put-forth a law to limit the car usage in the city. If you limit usage than progress in the environment will occur. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog ( Source 2, Paragraph 14)"". In only ""five-days"" more than half of congested pollution decreased due to the limiting of car usage in that area. Cars can just destroy the atmosphere but we as people can make a big change by just walking or riding a bike in the times where you don't need a car and just doing that is a great way to decrease pollution by limiting your car usage.

Some places and people in the world seem to thrive without cars in their everyday system. People who don't own cars seem to have less stress in their life. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way... ( Source 1, Paragraph 3)"". In some areas of the world the government has days to support the limiting of car usage by banning them for a temporary time. ""BOGOTA, Colombia- In a program... millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took busses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" ( Source 3, Paragraph 20)"". Having a day free of cars has a great chance of decreasing some of the modern stresses of life. Living a life without cars even if it is for a certain period of time is helpful in reducing the pressure on ones' life and gives nature a fighting chance on this planet.

Limiting car usage is beneficial to world whether the impact is small or large it all plays a good part in protecting our health and the environment around us. People have made changes some take to the extreme others don't do something about it until they see for themselves what it does.

75F00E3A019D,"Limiting on car usage has its advantages. Here are three reasons why i say limiting car usage has its advantages. Limiting on car usage has its advantages because you spend less money, less traffic and less car accidents. Dont you think that limiting on car has its advantages to?

To begin, Limiting on car usage has its advantages because you spend less money. When you spend twenty dollars a week or more on gas money for your car thats wasting money when you could just buy a bus pass for ten dollars and that will take u where u need to go for a week or more. Right there you just save ten dollars. what would you rather do spend twenty dollar a week on gas to get where you need to go or spend ten dollars a week on a bus pass which would also get u to where you need to go? Also you spend less money by limiting usage of cars by saving money on tickets. Now a days police pull you over any little thing wrong with your car and your tickets are just going to keep pileing up then if you dont pay them or send them to court you licenses will be suspended. When you just could avoid all of that.

Middle, Limiting on car usage has its advantages because less traffic. I know that in the passage, ""Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" it said,""BOGOTA, colombia- In a program that's set to spread to other countires, millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" but if more people are walking instead of taking cars there would be less traffic.

End, Limiting on car usage has its advantages because less car accidents. the more cars on the road the higher chance to get into a car accident. I know that you still could get in a car accident with a pedestrians but mostly car on car accidents happen. the less cars on the road the less accidents.

Conclusion, Limiting on car usage has its advantages. my three reasons were you spend less money, less traffic and less car accidents. That was how i explain why limiting on car usage has is advantages.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

The day without cars is part of an omprovement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. Its seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of Latin American city, according to the mayor. Parks and sports centers also have bllomed throughtout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replace by bread, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.

President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will geta fortuitous assist. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year passes. The United States, has no longer been on of the world's prime car cultures.

America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When they adjusted the population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter. In January 1995, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was.

Many sociologists believe it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility' companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle. With all these cahnges, people who stopeed car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.

A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question.

At the Mobile World Congrew last year in Barecelone, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable.

A961271C6097,"The cities of Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; and Bogota, Colombia all have something in common. They have all taken measures to use cars minimally for at least a small period of time. The results of car use are pollution and accidents among other large scale issues. The cities previously mentioned, however, have taken active roles in preventing these issues. It is no guess as to why the pollution is created; ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."" states Elisabeth Rosenthal of the

New York Times . A seemingly simple, but effective, idea could prevent the pollution caused by cars - limiting car usage. Cars have been a major cause of stress with people who always rush to arrive at their destinations, and social interaction (in person) has significantly shot onto the negative end of the spectrum because of the invention of cars. By limiting car usage, the overly tense and smogged communities alike would benefit.

A frustrated, tense driver is not an uncommon occurrence. The term ""road rage"" was not spontaneously thought of. The purpose of cars is to transport someone or something from destination ""A"" to destination ""B"" in a short amount of time. This makes the very nature of cars one of urgency and with urgency comes stress. Stressed drivers have been the cause of many a car accident. All it takes is someone who is almost late for a meeting to speed too quickly for an accident to occur. Cutting down on car usage would exponentially decrease the number of car accidents, and it is likely to increase the overall happiness of a community that harbors less cars on their streets. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" states Heidrun Walter of Vauban, Germany. The community of Vauban has given up their cars. In fact, there are only two places to park there; the parking garage requires a $40,000 fee to reserve a space, and it is rare to find a private garage for a home. Vauban is an example of what is likely the beginning of more communities based on minimal car use. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" states David Goldberg, official of Transportation of America. ""In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting 'car reduced' communities..."" (Elisabeth Rosenthal) Communities are realizing the benefits of reduced usage.

An astounding statistic: ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Elisabeth Rosenthal) Pollution is the main concern for the generation of fossil fuel consumers. It is not unknown that cars cause pollution because of the diesel and gasoline that fuels the car. The pollution cars bring will not cease to multiply until cars are used less, and hybrid cars are not necessarily the answer because there has always been controversy on whether people will actually buy them with time. Cities who ban car usage see significant changes in the quality of their atmosphere and an example of this is Paris. Paris, the travel destination of both adventurers and lovers, experiences some of the worst pollution - even when compared to Beijing, China. ""Congestion (car traffic) was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog... [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" stated Robert Duffer of the

Chicago Tribune . Paris benefited from the bans and reduced the amount of smog in the city. Paris took action on their car usage issue and it would be beneficial for other places to follow suit as pollution is an increasinly major environmental issue and health hazard.

Not only would pollution be shifting downward, but city projects would improve with the limited use of automobiles. Cars promote the improvement of highways and roads. This creates a situation in which the city funds the roads, but fails to focus on other important city structures such as sidewalks and local stores. Roads are constantly run down and massive amounts of tax money go into repairing them, but limiting car usage would prevent road damage and change the city's view on other structures. Bogota, Columbia has a ""Day without Cars"" to ""...promote alternative transportation and reduce smog,"" states Andrew Selsky of

Seattle Times . With just one day reserved for not using cars, ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks;...; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Andrew Selsky) Reducing car use enhances the experience of those who normally don't use cars because of improved bike paths, sidewalks, and is the foundation for a more lively city community.

Luckily, the United States seems to already be on the path to lowering numbers of cars used. ""...Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by,"" states Elisabeth Rosenthal from

""

""

. America is one of the biggest mascots of the car industry; they have always been on top of advertisement and 'showing off cars' with companies such as Ford and Mercedes. The decline of car usage is beneficial in America for the environment as emissions will be lowered, but the car companies would need to find a different tactic to generate or maintain money flow. The resulting effect is that not only would limiting car usage aid the environment, decrease stress levels, and promote structural integrity of a city, but it would be the dawn of a new cultural age based on a community that has a better transportation system to ""...conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety,"" as proposed by Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company. Limiting car usage will usher in a healthier age for the younger generations.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Many cities are now switching to become ""car free"".  The more that cities do this, we are seeing a decrease in pollution, less automobile related deaths per year, and more resources being conserved.

When cities switch to become car free, the pollution levels instantly decreasesd.  Due to the smog and the carbon monoxide emmitions in the atmosphere from cars, there is a hole in our Ozone layer in the atmosphere.  Now that people are banning cars in cities there is much more heathy air to breathe and it is much safer for our environment.  Also when there was more pollution in the air, and it rained, the rain turned in to acid rain causing erosion and killing several plants/animals.  If we could ban cars in more cities in the USA and all around the world, we would be living a much healthier lifestyle.

Also, the car free idea makes people much safer, as far as automobile accidents.  Because as the autombiles are banned from the city, the accident rate will go down more even than it already has.  Also Heidrun Walter said ""when I had a car I was alwyas tense.""  Not having a car, and not having the concern of crashing can relieve your stresses.  It is scientifically proven that when people are less stressed they get more sleep and have less angerment problems.  If cities switched to being car free, people could start living safer and happier.

Lastly, being car free, saves vital resources, and fossil fuels.  It takes millions of years to make oils, and gasses in the Earths crust, which we are wasting everyday on automobiles.  If we were able to save these resources, we could perhaps use more in rockets or space travel and maybe find another planet that can sustain our life.  If we were able to achieve this goal of saving resources, we could also all save money.  Imagine not having to pay for gas anymore.  You could be a millionare.  If we stopped using fossil fuels the world could become a much better place.

My point is, if we become car free, we could live safer, happier, and more wealthy lives.  If your community went the the mayor and state officials, it could happen for your city.  You could be the start to a revoulution and, start the journey to save humanity.  Not only would you get the bennifets of living safer, happier, and wealthier, but the whole world would be living in a much better place.  Please take this into consideration and make an effort to become ""car free"".               ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Just think about what would happen if people stopped using their cars and started walking or riding bikes for transportation. If we did that it would reduce greenhouse gas in Europe, it would also limit the amount of money spent on fuel used by the everyday economy, further more it would lower air polution.

First off, b limiting the epidemic of car usage it would reduce greenhouse gas in Europe .

Now in Europe 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions is made up of passenger cars. And 5o percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Just by taking a bus or riding a bike for transportation you could help limit  this cause. Its been plenty efforts in the past but now its starting to take affect exspecially in the suburbs.

Further more, we could be reducing the amount of fuel we need all over the world just by limiting the amount of time you use your car. We spend more money on fuel than we do anything else. Why, well because eveything needs fuel now a days. Diesels makes up 67 percent of vechicles in France,compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. We could really be putting our money towards other thing such as parks and rebuilding our communities. A study last year showed that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009..

Also, one of our major problems is air polution. We have a very high concentration of it. Well because majority of the people drivr their cars and cars take up fuel then that fuel is released through the motor and it gets into the air. Now just by limiting your car usage you good take aways stress and lower the amount of air polution said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. He and his wife made a difference just by riding a two-seat bicycle. As a result of the recession many may find less reason to resume the habit.

In conclusion, you can make a difference just by doing one little thing. Just sit back and think about what huge of an impact it will be if you lower your car usage. You can be that helping hand that reduces greenhouse gas not jujst for you but for evryone around you. Help limit the amount of money spent on fuel, we could be using that money for something usefull. Last but not least help lower the air polution it would really make a difference.

So riding a bicycle to work one day, won't just be good for you, it will also be good for the enviroment around you.

Cars have become a universal item. A lot of people have them, but no really gives them much thought. There are a few places that have spent the time and really developed ways to keep a community clean without the hazardous fumes coming from the car exhaust. For example, Vauban, Germany has developed a system where cars are banned. The only place you can keep your car is on the outskirts of town in designated garages. Due to this, most people dont even have a car, and have chosen to sell it before moving in. In Bogota, Columbia they had a developed a day free of cars where anyone that drove a car would have to pay a fine. According to the governer it was a amazing thing and everyone was participating in it. This also helped get some the nasty gases that they produce away.

Cars give of hazardous gases threw their exhaust. These gases will rise and get caught in the ozone. Which impacts the enviroment greatly in more ways than one. It can cause the air your breathing to be toxic. It also is one of the main reasons for ""Global Warming"". Paris learned this the hard when they reached a record level pollution. They decided they had no choice but to ban half the cars one day and ban the other half the next day. After this the congestion was down 60%, proving that it has helped greatly. Just imagine if one day instead of driving you could ride a bike and help change the eviroment.

Places have tried to develop ways to reduce the levels or gases. Some have been very succesful, for example, in Bogota and Vauban they have found creative ways to help. The question is whether or not cars should be done with all together. To that i'd have to say no, cars play a big part in getting to work on time or traveling. Taking cars away would mean taking away family trips and other fun things to do with cars. The real answer to the question is that cars should not become so much of a necessity. There should be ways for people to get around better without the use of cars. Now what that might be, the future has yet to tell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

If all areas of the united states banned or limited the vehile uses here it could greatly reduce the polution in our air. Which would in a long term result cause for better health conditions in people, but we'd sooner realize better health in young childern and the elderly. We would all have cleaner safer air to breath. But it would also help with the enviroment, the number of plants an animals harmed by polution would begin to decrease until the was just a fraction of the amount there is in this time now.

Also limiting the usage of cars will lower our use an burning of precious fossil fuels that once we use them up they are gone. Which this would also save us mass amounts of money that we we could use to keep this country out of debt. Limiting the use of cars will also stop us from having to get our fosssil fuel (oil) from other countries an having debts and money issues with all these other contries. We need to realixe that the usage of fossil fuels all these cars we have is draining our planet which is our home, what are we going to do when its a waste land after we suck all its nature fossil fuels an resources out of it.

Lastly the limiting of cars in the united astates would eventually cause for better health conditions in everyone but we'd sooner realize it in young childern an elderly adults. They wouldn't have such hard times breathing that they do have now causes by all of the polution in our air now. It would take some time but eventaully we'd have cleaner fresher air to breath and this would help decrease the amount of smog an decrease the amount of people with respatory health issues.

These are all things we need to be thinking about when we go into a discussion of limiting car usage these are not the only reasons there are many many more that can be used to help push the movement of limited car use.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In Paris people were told to abbandon their cars or have to face a $31 fine. There were at least 4,000 people who got fined and 27 people got their car impounded from the reaction of the fine. There was congestion that was down 60 percent in the capital of France. When they had cold nights and warm days it was due to to the warmer layer of air that can trap the car emmisions. It would be easier to think  than a car free.

In Bogota Columbia they have banned cars for 3 straight years. It would be a good time for the people to take away their stress and lower the air pollution that is being caused by this. Alot of people from different cities came to join the event. Because of this the day without cars made a huge improvement capaign that started in Bogota. Now the parks and sport centers that grew with bad uneven sidewalks have been replaced by new smooth sidewalks. Plus rush hour laws have made resturants and shopping places came up. With all of this happening it has made a change for everyone to enjoy what they didnt have before.

Authorites from othere contries came from Bogota to take a look at the event. It made a revolutionary change and has been crossing Borders.

Places like Germany, Paris, Columbia and more are joining up to use less cars and use more  pedestrians, public transportation, bycycle, ect to form a connected way of transportaion to save money, save resourses, lower polution percentages and improve safty.

According to the passage ""In German suburb, life goes on without cars"" written by Elisabeth Rosenthal "" passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissionsin Europe. And up two 50 percent in some car-intesive areas in the United States."" Imagain what would happen if we reduced the car rate use in just the US. We could conserve a large amount of fuel. That can be used for public trasportation, and also reduceing the price per gallon. It can also protect our enviromet. Alowing us to protect wild life, and breathing in chemicals that shouldn,t be inside our bodys. Just by doing this it could greatly effect or life lives in a positive way.

This means for a new way of live. A connected network that relies on everything and everyone doing there part. In doing so, it provides a safe and money saving enviroment. First of all you dont have to worry about paying those incompetent car bills. And you dont have to pay insurence for the car. Second you save money not paying for gas every week. alowwing yourself to move from place to place in your community, by public or comercial transportaion, or even bike riding is good, and safe. you dont have to wory about hitting somone or something. Or mabye someone hitting you. this could cause less trips to the hospitals and prevent less death. In the passage written by Elisabeth Rosenthal it says "" public transit was free of charge from friday to monday, according to the BBC"" So as you can see limiting car use is very effective, efficiant, and enviromently safe.

This is also a time savior. No worries about your car breaking down, cause riding the bus ensures you that ist regularly checked and regulated. walking asrrues you that its exercies so there is no need to waste time.

1F18B1FA090B,"Fellow citizens, I would like to talk about the advantages to the incipient idea of limited car usage. Limited car usage is the limitation of cars used in a certain area, however, the limitations all depends on the area. Some places in the world completely ban cars, in which you would need to pay a fine in order to even keep your car, much less drive it. Other places simply have limitations on a particular day(s), in whish on those days if you drive a car you may or may not be fined. The main advantage of limited car usage, is that it can reduce pollution in an area. Also limited car usage, although not obvious, can also help reduce car crashes.

If there is one major problem in the world that has yet to be solved, it is the amount of pollution, smog, and greenhouse gases that has accumilated throughout the Earth; limited car usage, however, can help reduce that problem. According to Robert Duffer, Paris enforced a partial driving ban when days of near-record pollution occured. ""[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.....The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"" (Duffer). Also in Bogota, Colombia, they have car-free days which help reduce air pollution. ""'

It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution ,' said buisinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife."" (Selsky). Also, citizins of limited car usage areas do not seem to mind and even enjoy not having a car, for example Heidrun Walter from Vauban, Germany, states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal). As shown by evidence, citizens agree that limited car usage not only helps the place's overall environment but also the Earth's environment, and some citizens of limited car usage areas do not even seem to mind it.

In addition, limited car usage can also reduce fatal car crashes. Although this second advantage is not as major as the first, in some perspectives, it is still important. Limited car usage seems to be linked to less people driving, as  I infered by this evidence ""There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license.....A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" (Rosenthal). With less people driving less fatal car crashes are bound to happen due to the fact that less people are driving. Although I may not be right, I feel as though two or more people bumping into each other while walking is not nearly as fatal as two or more cars 'bumping' into each other.

In total, although limited car usage may not seem to have many advantages, the few that it does have are detramental. Limited car usage has the advantages of not only helping the environment, but also helping or maybe even saving citizens from fatal car crashes throughout the world.

E1130AA34EE8,"Many countries and places are starting to reduce their usage of cars. In multiple places they are to considered ""car-free"" or they have ensued partial car bans, even going as far as setting a specific day to ""Car-free Day"". The issues in most of these places is the reduction of the smog that is thought to be produced by diesel vehicals. The fights against polution are really starting to take effect in a multitude of places, such as, Vauban, Germany. Paris, France and Bagota, Colombia. And their efforts against polution is really starting to take ahold and become popular.

In Vauban, Germany- The people of this high class community have completely given up their vehicals. In Vauban, street parking and other car related items are forbidden in the ""experimental new district"". The main thoroughfare however, is one of the few places on the edge of the city where car ownership is allowed. But, there are only ever two places to park. A large set of garages at the very edge of the development. Where said car owner would be required to but a space and a home for 40,000$. Just for a parking lot.

Resulting factors from this Car-Free suburban, people seem to be happier without their vehicals. Vauban's residents seem to rather enjoy ""the swish of bicycle tires, the chatter and laugter of the wandering children, drown out the occasional distant motor."" Vauban is to be considered a main component of a movement called ""smart planning"". When finished in 2006 57 percent of it's residents sold their vehicals to move into the residence.

Germany's efforts in the past two decades have never been as successful as Vauban has been. With its 5,500 residents withing a rectangualr square mile, it is considered to be on of the most advanced experiments in low-car/carless suburban life. Germany has been attempting to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transport. Whether it be bikes, walking, skates or some form of physical transport. Near by these carless suburbs, they place stores along a main street near the suburb and not in some mall miles away on a interstate/highway.

Even though Germany is trying to create a utopia of carless suburbs there are still places that still thrive on the dream of large New York-ian style suburbs, private garages and spread out homes. These were the deam towns of the 1950's. Granted some of these ideas are still highly appealing to most places, places are staring to look more and more Vauban-like.

In Paris, France- Paris enforced a partial driving ban on it's residents to help clear out the choking smog, which is rival to that of Beijing, China. Paris officials ordered motorists with even-numbered license plates to keep their cars at home or they will be fined 22 euros or 31$ in American currency. The same ensued for those with odd-numbered plates the next day.

Due to this ban and fine on automobiles, almost 4,000 people had their cars impounded due to their reactions to getting a fine. Granted in the same token street congestion was down nearly 60% in France's capital. France, and Paris officials blammed diesel vehicals for their abundance of smog, although there is a tax that favors diesal gas instead of regular gasoline. So in turn to this gas tax, diesal made up 67% of all vehicals in France.

Unfortunately due to the high percentage of diesal vehicals the Paris has more smog that any other European capital. Although this ban did have a few consiquences, delivery companies complained of lost revenue. While people with plug-in cars, hybrids, and cares carrying three or more passangers. People found that public transit was completely free of charge during the experimental period of this car ban. The smog thankfully cleared just enough that the ruling French party to rescind the car ban for odd-numbered plates a few days later.

In Bagota Colombia- Colombian officials set to spread a program across to ohther countries. Millions of Colombians hiked, skated, biked, and or took buses to work durring car-free day. For a period of three years Colombia has dedicated one day to car-free day, all violators would be fined 25$. In a city of 7 million. The goal is to reduce and promote alternative tranportations to and from work, school, home, and to reduce smog levels umungst the city.

Despite the heavy rains and grey skies, the turnout was more than expeced. And for the first time, two other Colombian cities joined into the event, spreading it further than ever. Officials from other countries came to Bagota to see the car-free event and were exstatic. Claming that the people of Colombia were generating a revolutionary change, and it's crossing borders.

This day has been a work in progress ever since the mid 1990's. Bagota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. The most any Latin American city has ever seen in years past. An abundance of parks and sports centers have popped up, sidewalks that were small, worn and pitted have been completely replaced with smooth broad sidewalks and paths. Even new upscale dining and shopping districts have popped up due to this car-free day.

Goals set by President Obama are seemingly being unveiled as time passes due to studies suggesting that Americans are buying fewer cars, and all together driving less and less as time passes by. With the United States being one of the worlds largest car capitals, it seems that love for cars is dwindleing with efforts to keep down polution and smog levels.

The most accurate assumption today as to why the US's love and total buying of cars has dwindled so drastically is due to the recession that we had experienced. Cash-stapped Americans couldnt afford to buy new vehicals and that seems to be a persistant happening as the years pass. Unfortunately major car companies are starting to suffer due to this fall of people indulging in a car purchase.

Companies such as Ford and Mercedes are already starting to ""rebrand"" themselves as mobility companies and reorganising their product with wider varieties. Not only has car buying dropped, so has the rate of people between the ages of 16-39 getting a license. Most people are turning to car-pooling, walking or public transportation to get to their jobs, or other places, so in turn, getting a license is in not in the forefront of their mind.

Many countries are getting on the bandwaggon of fighting against polution, ensueing laws against driving all together, creating temporaty or partial bans. And they see a difference in their smog, polution levels. These people/countries are taking the innitiative to take care of the major underlying problems to much bigger problems such as global warming and problems of that nature. There are changes happening, and these changes are benefiting everyone.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
3320DB48E48D,"Did you know that some cities in the world are car-free? Cities like Vauban, Paris, and Bogota  don't use cars. There are many advantages when it comes to limiting car usage. Less cars mean a decrease in air pollution, alternative transportation, and fewer traffic jams.

Due to a near-record pollution, Paris decided to partially ban driving to clear the pollutants in the air. Usually, Paris is more polluted than other European capitals. According to Reuters, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe"" (Source 2 paragraph 16 lines 3-5). America's second largest source of emissions is transportation.

Bogota, Columbia started a car free campaign in the mid-1990s to promote alternative transportation. Millions of Columbians celebrated this day by either hiking, biking, skating, or riding the buses to work. Two other Columbian cities joined the event. This car free day gives people a chance to improve the city. ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks..."" (Source 3 paragraph 28 lines 2-3).

Reducing the usage of cars also drastically cuts the amount of traffic jams. According to Andrew Selsky, ""...rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic..."" (Source 3 lines 30-31). Mimi Sheller says that ""The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing an dhas drawn empty nesters back in"" (Source 4 paragraph 35 lines 9-11).

The cities that have reduced car usage are making the planet a little better each day. Fewer traffic jams, decreases in the amount of pollutants, and alternative transportation can all happen if we decrease the amount of cars we use each day.                                            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Limiting car usage has a more postivite affect then using a car.

Restricing the usage of cars means an advantage on a safer and healthier enviorment. When using a car it polutes our air making the enviorment harsh. In the text it says ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" This quation shows that reducing the use of cars can cause harsh conditions, such as smog, to reduce providing a safer enviorment for people and creatures living there. The text also says ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pittted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" This evidence proving that with out the usage of cars the surroundings of a harsh city improved from things like uneven sidewalks, that could have caused people to walk on streets causing traffic or accidents, fixed to smooth sidewalks that people can use safely. The text also says ""If the pattern persists - and many sociologist believe it will - it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviorment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" This evidence proves that limiting the usage of cars can lower the amount of emissions polluting the air we need to survive. Reducing the pollution in our air would conclude in safe, more efficent, and long-lasting enviorment. Therefore, limiting the usage of cars have a more sufficent amount of advantages then not limiting the usage of cars.

Reducing the usage of cars also have advantages on people's well-being and happiness. Without the stress of sitting in a tiny box in todays new trafic jam, yelling at the car infont of you, behind you, or next to you, you could be out enjoying the fresh air not having to worry about being late because of an accident you weren't even in. The article says ""'Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution' said a businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife."" This evidence shows that without the use of cars people can be stress free, promoting a healthier enviorment with a smile. The text also states ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.'"" This proving that with less usage from vehicles people are able to improve their living conditions by making minor adjustments. The advantages of limiting the usage of cars is more beneficial then not reducing the usage of vehicles.

Limiting car usage has more advantages and is beneficial to the safety of our enviorment.

The popular use of cars and motorcycles have forced France to ban driving to clear the smog in their city. Pollution in this city has obviously grown over the years, by reducing the use of these machines has helped the enviroment.

In Addition, 'Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota' by Andrew Selsky records that there is a day banning vehicle use as well know as the Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia, with an exception of buses and taxis.

First, you wouldn'nt have to worry about gas, theres no need to buy gas if you dont have a car. Second, you'll become healthier. Third, more interraction with the world.

All the money you spend on gas.. what a shame! If we didn't have cars you'd have more money, imagine what you would do with all that money. Maybe a nicer house or maybe a nice big pool in the backyard, you'd never know unless you give it a try. I know what your thinking how would I get to work or how would I get to the doctors; they're would still be public transportation to get you to important places.

If there were no cars, many people would be a lot healthier. Not just people, the environment would be a much healthier places. Polution rates go down, less asthma attacks, more fun, no honking, no worrying about wether the kids are alright to be outside by themselves; sounds good to me. There would also be more family bonding, go for nice walks to the park or beach.

Imagine your walking down the street, you know everyone, you stop and talk, maybe laugh. That's what it'd be like with no cars. Not one face on the street that you didn't know. Many gatherings with friends, many laughs, a lot of fun it sounds like.

As an outcome, the cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to cage in car emissions.  With the limitation of car usage comes the decrease of toxic air roaming into our atmosphere, and an increase of a healthier lively one.

Besides the enviormental effects car usage has had on us, there is also human effect. Many people around the world have participated in events in which they were to quit the car usage and were to find different methods of transportation, and the feedback was positive. In Vauban, Germany there is a resident of an upscale community whom had owned a car, but had decided to give it up. Heidrun Walkter, a mother of two, had once owned a car but now she walks the streets and is able to hear the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children. She says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

The limit of car usage has also brought about more days of physical activity. In Bogota, Columbia, there were millions of Columbians who hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car free day they had, in attempt to lower the smog in the air. In return, what the people got out of this day was both the decrease in smog, but also the decrease of stress. Not only did the day leave the capital city completely devoid of traffic jams but also brought many people closer with each other. As an example, a man riding a bicylcle with his wife around the city, and says to say it was beneficial for both the enviroment and themselves.

Overall, the limitation of car usage has drastically decreased the amount of air pollution, and smog around the world. It has brought about the sound of children playing and the sound of people riding their bicycles. Many of the countries around the world participate in events to lower the harmful outcomes of the car usage from Germany to Paris, to Columbia and the United States, but there are still efforts in which they are present.

06BE6D6749EA,There once was three citizen friends from boston who wanted who wanted to limit car usage to 70 percent they realized it was a good idea because it'll help people avdanced experiment in low-car suburban life but its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation with less parking space in this new approach stores are far away to walk to on a main street rather than in small malls around some distant highway at the same time its a good idea because if they give up their cars therre will less traffic no accidents or any parking space and it will be less problems with people they think if they give up there cars there will be a safer street for everyone but some people didnt like idea because if they give up there cars they wont be able to get to their jobs on time and at the same some people live to far from jobs and homes that they want keep people driving their cars            ,2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B17A58769FF3,"Theres so many roads in the world but traffic still exists. Ever think about the amount of cars in your neighborhood?, dont you think thats probaly the reason why? In the Sources 1,2,3 , and 4 all imphasizes on how having a limit of car usage can be an great advantage to society. I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.

With that being said , Limiting car use lowers air pollution. I agree with this because the less cars driven leads to less burning fuel. According to the passage by Robert Duffer paragraph 10 states that ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""Due to the high population in Paris and numerous amount of the owning a vehicle causes massive car pollution. Having massive car pollution can be dangerous, this inherits sickness, stress and diseases. Refering to the source ""Car-free Day is spinning into a big hit in Bogata,Columbia"" Mayor Of Bogota (Antanas Mockus) stated that ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" As he rode a two seater bike with his wife. The Mayor in this content speaks the absolute truth. As you walk to your destination in the nice warm air you relive stress and diseases that were causing you to be sick before. Those are the reasons why i think limiting car usage lowers the pollution.

Additionally, Limitiing car usage decreases traffic. This is true because if there is 5 people going to the same place you are and all of you guys drive in that one car or bus that reduces the traffic. Micheal Sivak In Source 4 ( The end of car Culture) elaborates on that by saying ""What most intrgues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before downturn, I Think that means something more fundamental is going on.""What Mr. Sivak means by this is that everyone should only have a certain amount of car per household and person Which will also lower the traffic. Traffic in paris is very long but due to the car-free act traffic was reduces. from reading source 2 by Robert Duffer ,it states ""Congestion was down 60 % in the capital of france (Paris), after five days of intensifying smong."" Just in five days of no driving the air is already unpolluted imageded if you drived five days all day. Those are the reasons why i think that Limiting car usage is an advantage.

To Conclude,I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E18AA533BCFC,"These article that are given to me have good reasons why we may not need cars as time passes by, and their advantages.

In the first article, it gives many reasons why some people in Germany dont need, or used cars. In the third paragraph, second sentence, a women states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Meaning, that she probably had a lot of issues when she had a car, maybe it was engine problems, battery, or maybe the gas prices that they used to have, but now she can relaxe, not having to deal with any engine problems, battery problems, or the gas prices, now that she doesn't own a car. Now she probably just has a bike, and bike are really easy to fix, not like a car were you have to pay someone to fix it for you, also pay for items that the person fixing your car has used. Basically some people in Germany are trying to save money, and have found a way to do it.

Next, the second article and the third article, take on one of the most important thing, our planet. In the two article it gives alot of reasons why a car is banned from Paris and Bogota, Colombia, but the one that captures me the most would be on the paragraph 17, were it states ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals."" Showing that Paris has noticed a problem and are actually doing something about it. They have banned cars to see if that is the actual problem, and they have found out that the cars are the problem. And they're answer to that problem is to set a fine to those people that had their cars with even numbered licence plates on Mondays and odd numbered licenced plates on the following day. Paris then got the results, if the cars were the problem, and yes it was, there was less smog, so they had decided to leave the fine. And in the third article, it shows that also Colombia is taking part of a smog free place. But they instead decide to ban cars and only give permission to buses and taxi drivers to drive. But they don't only give bus drivers and taxi drivers osmething to enjoy, the have also given their people ways to enjoy a place without cars. They have fixed their old, beat-up sidewalks and have put more bicycle trails for people that don't drive buses or taxis.

Last but not least, in the last article it shows that even a powerful and strong nation can also take part of helping the planet, by lowering its most known culture, driving. It might seem like America is taking a part of helping the planet, by lowering the number of cars, and drivers. The statement that captures my attention the most would be ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009."" Meaning that a nation were young people would come to lead it in the future, some have decided to do it by hard work. Some would lead it by doign it in the hard, but basically simple way, driving.

In conclusion, those are my reasons to why limiting car usage have its advantages, by saving money, peoples lives, and our planet.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
913FFB8B7312,"Usuage of cars should be limited for many reasons.  Many people in different countries agree that cars should be either baned or not used as constantly.  Pollution, Economy, and people's health are all a factor to limiting car usuage.

In Vauban, Germany, people have given up their cars. There is a fee to park in Vauban which is a coast of $40,000.  No one is going to want to drive do to that outrageous price.  70 percent of the people living in Vauban doesnt own a car and, 57 percent sold their car once they moved there.  ""'When I had a car i was always tense.  I'm much happier this way' said Heidrun Walter"".  This quote shows that cars just bring you done emotionly and you'll feel better with out one.  In Vauban, cars are causing 12 percent of greenhouse gases.  The percent of greenhouse gases are four times higher in the U.S do to car's gas emissions.

In Paris, there is a smog problem going on.  There is so much pollution in the air that there was a forced ban on driving.  If anyone was found driving they were fined $31.  4,000 people were fined and 27 had their cars taken do to not wanting to pay the fine or being difficult.  Paris had the most smog out of the European country; in Paris there was 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114 and, London had 79.7.

Bogota, Colombia has an annual car-free day.  A day full of hiking, biking, skating and bus riding.  If found driving on the car-free day you are fined with $25.  ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Plaza"".  President Obama is getting envolved with the limiting car usuage aslo. His goal is to curb the greenhouse gas emissions.  There have been less cars bought and licenses given out as the years go by.  Lastly, there has been a 23 percent decrease in young peolple driving from the years 2001 to 2009.

These are some reasons why car usuage should be limited; and as you can see many countries are starting to make a difference.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
5CE46A992889,"Cars are a huge advantage in traveling. They can get people to places faster than a single horse could; and their a lot safer than riding on a horse. While there are positive advantages to these moble transportations, there are also negative portions that cars have. You may be awfully suprised what these transports can do outside their good nature. For instance, cars run on fossil fuel, which is a artifical gas that ruins the enviorment as much as people cutting down trees and smoke coming out of nuclear plants that do damage to the clouds in the sky. Cars don't just hurt the enviorment, they hurt innocent lives as well. Let me pull out an example: Person A and Person C are driving on the interstate when Person B spills out too much fossil fuel from the exaust pipe of his car. This causes both Person A & C to spin out of control and crash into each other because they couldn't see the road very well because of Person B. This isn't the only threat cars can pull into, but I'll get to that later. With all these bad occurances that happen people have been wondering, ""how can we save both lives and the enviorment from the issues of cars at the same time""? There is a way to do just that: limiting car usage.

Like I said before, cars can have a lot of negative issues in their state of mind. Some examples are foggy weather, over usage of fossil fuel, speeding, texting and driving, drunk driving and many more that exist that I cannot mention. Because of these issues, cities like Vauban Germany, Paris France and Bogota Colombia have banned(well not really banned but you get what i mean) driving cars due to the bad issues cars can/have caused. In the US, the presentage of people driving cars has decreased a lot over the past few years (the story doesn't say what persentage). As much as I hate them doing that, they actually have a reason. In this case of fellow citizens, car usage should be banned for various reasons. I won't be telling all the reasons because that would take a long time to do so.

Reason #1: Drunk driving. Have you ever known someone or heard about an incident were a person is drunk inside a car and crashes into any random source they don't see coming? Well, let us face the facts: drunk people should not drive. If someone is drunk at a bar and is feeling funny, they should either walk home or get someone to pick them up. Drunk people who drive have a great chance at getting someone hurt of themselves hurt because of their stupid attitude. The person shouldn't drive again until they are fully consious again. Reason #2: Extreme weather. When people drive in extreme, they are risking their lives in a greater persentage than a zombie apocolypse, terrorists invading any country and being attacked by people who try to kill you. Extreme weather like thunderstorms, hail and strong fog are too dangerous for people to drive in. If you drive in that type of weather, there is a 90% chance you will not make it out without injuries. People need to wait for the weather to either calm down or stop completely(I just wait until it stops completely so that it wouldn't get worse as it calms down). This will help them prevent them or anyone from getting a wreck. If it occurs randomly while your driving then your screwed. Reason #3: texting and driving. Why is it that most people in this generation keep getting stupid and stupid every single minute? This is one of those incidents that has such that. People who text while driving pay more attention to their stupid phone than focusing on driving. Like drunk driving people who care about texting so much need to either sit in the back and text or not ride in the car at all. They propably should stay away from a car as long as possible until they learn to not text and drive at the same time. You can't do two things at once unless you're some one fictional or a pro at it. Final reason: Expoit of fossil fuels. I don't need to talk much about this one because I already did in my first paragraph and it is related to the extreme weather topic but I will do it once more. Cars that exploit fossil fuels can cause damage to the enviorment. If the smoke is exploited too much it can not only more damage to the enviorment, but it can cause people to reck as well.

These are the reasons that fellow citizens like you should limit your car usages. Remember that cars are not a same transportation vehicle that can get you from point A to Point B, they have a dark side like everything else. Even if you do limit your car usages, it doesn't mean you are safe from the world that hunts you down. Be careful out there and follow the percautions of safty carefully when you are traveling either by car or anyother place.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E239B8ABB462,"Since the car was first created there has been many innovations to different types of cars. However, studies have shown that in the last few years the percentage of people getting a license has dropped. There are many advantages in limiting car usage not only in the city but also in the suburbs.

The first of these advantages has to due with our never ending problem with our environment.  For example, as stated in source number 2 the city of Paris had been very polluted. To solve this problem the ruling party in France enforced a driving ban. After five days of this driving ban being in effect the smog in Paris had gone down by 60%. Becasue of this ban the city of Paris is a cleaner place to live now and another result of this ban is that people truly can see how much pollution these cars create.

Another advantage of limiting car use is that once these cars are gone people are much more sociable. In source 1, the government of Germany has created a suburban community where there is no cars. Car ownership is allowed however there are only two places to park and it is very expensive. Because of this 70% of families in this community do not own cars. To get around in this community you are able to walk, ride a bike, skate, etc. As a result, you do not hear cars on the streets but you do hear bike swishing and kids playing with eachother. Many studies have also shown that a day without a car is a very effective stress reliever, as stated in Source 3.

Now a world without cars is very hard to imagine because of all the different places that everybody has to get there however, there are many alternatives to using cars on a daily basis. These alternatives include public transportation, bikes, skates, walking, and also car pooling. If there is a reduction of car usage the environment will recieve a very large benefit.

As the articles provided has shown, there are many advantages to the limiting of car usage and it will not only benefit us as humans but also our environment.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A8B028FCCF5B,"The limiting of usage a car has to stop because it destroy our country. How can cars destroy our country? Car can destroy our green house in many ways. one way if with all the components that the car have. For example, it can be destroy with the steam that the car throw out in the air(gas).Sometimes people can have  stress by having a car because they have to payed a lot, if a car doest'n work. They had to send the car to a place that can be fixed  and it can expand a lot of your money.

To begin with,sometimes car can be good for people that have there job far away of their home. But also car can cause you to have stress. for example in the source 3:car-free day is spinningn into  a big hit Bogota said that ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lolwer air pollution"". This is true because if we not using a car, we don't have to worry to pay taxed, or to fixed the car. In my opinion if we just start to using car all the time, this is going to cause a big problem. Why cars can cause you a big problem on your daily life? Because cars can stop you to walk,can stop you to do a lot of things. You can get sick, one problem that United States has is the fat people. Why fat people? because they just start to use car and they doesn' t realize that if you use a lot the car, you forget that you have to do exersise or to walk. Well, is not just the car that can cause you to be fat, there are other stuff that can cause you to be fat. In the sources 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, said that ""that few  soccer moms or communiting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars"". They notice that cars can causing a lot of problems by paying a lot. Some people had to decide to gave up their car by walking to their jobs, or going to buy some food or just want to walk to be healthy.

Cars can be a limited for some people. If we just be a liltle thinker sometimes, we can notice that us, ""THE HUMAN"" we are destroyed our world with all the substances that the car hurl in the air. This world was make to protect us, but we just like to destroy the nature by the chemical that the car has, and other stuff that cause the world to be destroy.

F3966A089068,"Cars make it exceptionally easy to travel and move around. Auto use permets an individual to go to places they have not been before. In Europe, the countries that share the Schengen space allow Europeans to move freely. To avoid pricy plane and train tickets, a lot of Europeans use their cars to go to an entirely different country and experience a variety of different cultures in a matter of hours. It is most certainly a priviledge. Despite the many pros of having a car, the cons outweight them. Throughout this essay I will explain the advantages of limiting car usage.

In many countries and cities car usage has dropped. Some countries,it is purely accidental or due to economic reasons and in some cities and countries, this decline is intended. In a city called Vauban in Germany, citizens have given up their cars. In this city,street parking,driveways and garages are more often than not forbidden. This may seem strange to  not have the priviledge to own a car or  a garage. But most of the residents have moved out from the city to live here. Heidrun Walter claims that she is much happier this way and before she was always tense.70% of the Vauban's family do not own a car, and 57% sold their cars to live in Vauban. This particular city is a mere example of a growing trend in Europe,the United States and various other country. The plan is to seperate suburban life from auto use;this movement is called ""smart planning"".

In opposition, to these efforts, automobiles are usually an important factor to the suburbs where usually middle-class people live. This causes a huge impediment to current efforts to significally reduce greenhous gas emissions from passenger cars. In Europe,passenger cars are the reason for the 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions; in the United states that number almost quadriples in size in some car-intensive areas. The approach is to make suburbs more compact rather than having malls on the border on distant highways.

Due to smog and pollution to this global city's air, Paris enforced a driving ban to put an end to polution. 4,000 drivers were rightfully so fined that day. This issue had to be taken seriously for a greater cause. For example, for the smog levels to decrease and to purify the air in the cities and suburbs and to prevent pollution. Public transit was free for those five days that the ban was enforced. Congestion dropped 60% in Paris, ever since the driving ban. The smog rivaled Beijing, which is often known for being one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed because of a tax policy  in  favor of diesel fuel in France. More than half of vehicles run on diesel fuel in France.

In the Colombia's capital, Bogota, many colombians hiked,skated or took buses to work in spirit of their car free day. Personally I think this was an extravagent idea. It teaches people to not be so dependent on cars. This day significantly reduced traffic jams,smog and promoted transportation. This was a wonderful oppurtunity to lower stress and air pollution at the same time! Parks and sports bloomed that day, sidewalks that were unfinished and in poor conditions were replaced,the traffic decreased and restaurants blossemed. This car free day had an amazing impact on  this community and the world.

Due to recents studies, Americans are driving less  and buying few cars as the years go by. The miles driven have peaked in 2005 , but as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person dropped 9% , and was equal to the percentage in Janurary 1995. Scientist state that this decline is beneficial for carbon emissions and the enviroment. Although this might affect dearly the car industries. The rise of cellphones,internet and apps this permits a more flexible way of making commuting arangements,and the evolution of vans services.

A lot of people have been using public transportation and biking to get around. There has been a drop from 16-39 year olds in getting their license. Getting license is not as big as of priority for those people. They revolve their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take busses and trains or car-pool with friends.

To conclude, I strongly believe that limiting car use would benefit different aspects in peoples lives. But for people to give up using cars,the recontruction of suburban cities is a very important. I live in the suburbs and despite the houses around, you would need a car to go to the grocery store,restaurant and to have fun with your friends. Highways usually circle around suburban cities and that  may cause congestion. To make car usage less of a priority for citizens, we would have to think of the greater cause and to restablish cities to not prohibit people from moving around. The decline in car use will improve the world for the generations to come.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Smog is one of the biggest effects to car usage. Smog is actually getting so bad in certain places like Paris that they actually have to ban car use. A lot of places have been recorded to have a lot of pollution like France, only because they perfer diesel fuel. Paris has even let the public transit to be free of charge from Monday to Friday. So if everyone worked on not driving we could slow down pollution a lot, and make a big change.

Bogota, Colombia is a place that is trying to make a change. They have created an event called ""car-free day"". A day where no cars are allowed to be used what so ever. The goal is doing this they say is to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Bogota had a large turnout to this event, even despite the rain showers Bogota got that day, that didnt stop them from participating in this event. This event has really changes Bogota for the better, because the event is persuading less people to drive every year. Which helps out a lot and makes a huge impact in slowing down pollution.

Some people believe that the culture of the car is coming to its end. And that is not a bad thing at all, in fact it could be one of the greatest thing to happen in history. Researchers say that less and less people are getting licenses every year, and more people are starting to use public transportation. If everyone could just work to drive less and use public transportation, we could make the car a thing of the past.

Cars are a huge problem on pollution to this day. Our goal is to stop this and make a difference. I hope this essay shows you how much of a difference you could make if you just limited your car usage.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
DA3B68ED05FE,"The works of a car have created wonders to people as early as the early 1900s. Now people need to understand the advatages of limting car use. Pollution has gone down in cities from not using cars and people have reported less stress, which is due to the car rates going down. Many people have argued that jobs are going to go more down then we may need, if we stop using cars, but there is always a way to fix small situations such as that.

Studies have shown cars have created pollution for the enviornment. Pollution can cause sickness and other affects that can cause a habitat to be inhabitable.""Pasenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States,""(Rosenthal,5). Though, we can fix that. Many cities such as Paris,France have experimented with the law involving cars to see if the country can have a pollution decrease and they did, within the first day. Duffer reported that on Monday Paris created a ban for the even-numbered plates and the smog was able to clear in one day's time. ""The smog cleared enough Monay for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday,"" (Duffer,19).

People have argued that stopping car production may cause people to lose their jobs. There is a way to fix that. Selsky reported that in Bogota,Colombia because of the car distribution slowing down they were able to make parks and sport centers accessiable. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city,""(Selsky,28). With that being said without people running any of those faclities then parks and sport centers wouldn't be that accessiable to the fellow citizens. So by creating more places like parks and sport centers, and less places like car factories we would be able to limit car usage without the worry of someone losing their job and not being able to get one.

Cars have also been known to cause stress. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" Rosaenthal quoted Heidrun Walter talking about how tense she was when she had a car. The constant worrying for gas and car bills may be a factor towards the stress in someone's life. Young adults have not worried as much for a car, making the somewhat more content. ""Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy,"" (Rosenthal,39).

Limting car use can cause a major impact on today's society. ""Demographic shifts in driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate,"" (Rosenthal,38). It has many advantages that people should understand. Pollution rates can go down. Stress could go down once you start limting car use.                                                     ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In conclution limitting car usage has alot of advanteges. One is that people dont feel as much preasure when not driving, and the onther is that cars are very bad for our environment. Limitting car usage could make our world a better place overall.                                                                            ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
3F6DD8772F4A,"The usage of cars around the whole world has been the main reason why the earth is facing with air pollution problems and day by day our ozone layer is breaking. To solve this problem we can limit the usage of cars or any type of moving vehicle that can harm us and use other efficient ways to get to places.

There have been places in this world where they have started to move to make a difference in the earth. For example in source one ""Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"" except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs..."" in Vauban, Germany there are alot of suburban communities who have giving up using cars or have sold their cars to make their houses where they live. Not only have they be making car free streets but also have taken out parking spaces so that people can reduce the usage of cars. This change can be either economicaly better for everyone but can also be useful for people to start thinking to go outside more. In Bogota, Colombia they have created a program that is set to spread to all the Colombians to hike, bike, skate and also take the bus to their jobs, it is a car-free day like stated in this statement from source 3 ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" This improvement campaign began in the mid-1990s.

In other countires like in source two ""after days or near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban to clear the air of the global city"" this was due to the large amount of smog that cars give out to the layers of air. The citizens of Paris would also have to pay a fine. Source two also states that ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitlas... [last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particular matter (PM) per cubic mater compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" this is the reason why Paris has started to make a change. They are many other solutions to changing the cars we us today to others like electrical cars where you only have to charge them and you can use them it would not harm our ecosystem in any way. Driving a car not only affects our earth but can be very stressful for the driver because he or she would have to face in their every day life traffic jams, but looking for other ways to get to your destination would separate you from having to go through that everyday.

One of the biggest produces of this problem is the United States of the America where all of the cars we know have been created and is also one the most more advanced countries. In source four is states that ""President Obamas's ambitious goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled las week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suugest that Americans are buying fewer cars, drivinf less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" as hard as this sounds if we dont get to moving we will soon die little by little. We also lower down the percentage of car accidents if we reduce the usage of cars, the level of mortality would not decrease so fast.

In conclusion, you have learned that driving a car is very harmful for the planet and if we dont start making a change our earth would be more polluted then how it is now. Start making a change and think smart.     ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B72814616287,"In the French and Swiss borders, Vauban streets are completely car free. In Vauban Germany, enforcements are very strict on car policy. Some people even have to sell their car to move there. Although, car ownership is allowed, but it is only to be parked in large garages along with a home for $40,000. Because of this 70 percent of Vauban families do not own cars.

In 2006 Vauban grew a trend in Europe of separating Suburban life from auto use to ""drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes."" They called this ""Smart Planning.""

While there had been effort to make the city denser during the past few decades, Vauban had gave 5,500 home to residents, making it less accessible to public transportation, and less space for parking. This leaded to the making of the environmental Protection Agency. This agencies promotion was to reduce car use. In the result of the agency, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highway and only 20 percent to other transport.

Germany doesn't seem to be the only one to ban cars. Driving in Paris has been ban due to smog. Paris banned driving due to near-record pollution. To confiscate, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear to air. Along with the driving ban, a fine was included too for some. On Monday motorists with even numbered liscense plates were told to leave their car at home or recieve a fine of $31. Odd plates would suffer the same consequence as well the following day. This all led to approximately 4,000 drivers being fined. After five-days of intensifying smog, conjestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france. No surprise, the diesel fuel was blamed for the incident. Accordingly it mentions diesel makes up about 67 percent of vehicles in France.

Gradually, in one week, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to recsind the ban for odd-numbered plates the next day.    ",1,Car-free cities,Text dependent

If we stop useing cars this could be a realitly there would be less CO² Emissons. A lot of the deaths and major injeoreys would be decreased on a daily basis. Every one would be more fit and active. These are just a few reasons that giving up your car is a good idea.

if most people were to give up there car then there would be less CO² Emmissons andn the air would be cleaner. the cleaner the air the easier everyone can breath. if the CO

² went down the the green house gasses would go down and the trees that absorbe in the gasses would have a easier time and globle warming would slowdown.

every day people die or are injerored in car accadents the loss affects the families to so if we get rid of cars then less people would die and there would be less greiving families. imagen how you would feel if any of your families died in a car crash.

if everyone had to walk or bike to work then everyone would be more fit and healthy. alot of americans are obeies i know i am to but if every one had to walk or bike insted of sit in a car and drive then every one would be more fit making a better labor force.

so if every one were to stop driiving and give up therer cars then everyone could breath better. there would be less death and less greaving familys. there would also be a more fit labor force for the jobs that needed to be done. i think that is a world i would want to live in dont you.

7007356F4BF0,"Limited car use has dramatically reduced the amount of enviromental toxins in the air in some cities. Paris, France and Bogota, Colombia have banned car use for a day and have seen the air clean up just because very few cars were being driven. One community in Germany even banned the use of cars in general. The enviroment is in dire need of help and we can help it. If everyone took one day out of the week where we did not drive anywhere and on the other six days we drove as little as possible and carpooled the air would be so much cleaner. Not driving also has added health benefits, walking or biking everywhere is a good way to excersise.

A new kind of suburb has been created in Germany where cars are not allowed. There are a few roads on the perimeter of the city that allow cars to be driven but besides that residents walk or bike everywhere. There is little pollution in the air and residents are able to take a tram into neighboring cities. Seventy percent of families do not have a car and fifty-seven percent of families sold their car to live in this community. If you own a car in this community you can buy a parking spot for forty thousand dollars. One resident, Heidrum Walter, said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier that way."" Lack of cars also gives parents peace of mind, cars are still dangerous machines and in this community their kids can play without their parents worrying about them getting involved in an accident.

Paris' pollution rates have been rising over the years and hit almost record level highs for a few days, so in order to reduce the amount of smog in the air there was a temporary car ban. One day anyone who has a even-number license plate was not allowed to drive. If you were caught driving you had to pay a fine that is equalivant to thirty-one U.S. dollars. The smog miraculosly cleared up quickly and people were able to drive again. Another city in Columbia, Bogota, holds a ""Day Without Cars"", once a year. Citizens are allowed to use public buses and taxis during this day. The government is trying to advocate for public transportation and smog reduction. Most people walk on this day and even though it has rained on this day before citizens participated just the same.

When you choose to walk or bike everywhere it not only makes an impact on the enviroment but it also reduces your risks for dieseases like obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Obesity rates in America are a lot higher than they should be and that's partially due to lack of physical activity. By walking or biking to work or to school you reduce that risk because your heart rate is up and your body is moving. Of course if people stop driving obesity will still exist due to our horrible eating habits but it would help a lot. If there was less driving it would also be beneficial to our health because we would be breathing cleaner air. The air we breathe is often times highly polluted and if there was less cars not as many deadly chemicals would be in the air. There would still be cigarette smoke and factory pollution but it would be dramatically less.

If people in America reduced their driving time it would be better for the air and better for us. Many other cities have proposed an annual day without cars so I think cities in America should start doing it. We only have one world and although we have done a pretty horrible job of taking care of it, that does not mean we can't attempt to fix the mess we made.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
078A66FE7AFB,"Vauban, Germany, home to 5,500 residents is taking a new rout to life... without cars. In this community street parking, drivewaves, and home garages are almost non-exsistant. The streets are ""car free"" except for the main thoroughfare. Cars are allowed, but there's only two places for parking: large garages and the edge of a development where the car owner has to pay 40,000 for the car space and buy the home.

70% of the people in Vauban don't own cars, and 54% have giving up their cars to live there. They feel happier without them. This is trending in Europe, people are calling it ""smart planning"" and it's also trending in the United States considering we have 50% green house gas from auto mobiles. With the less parking places, stores are just a short walk away from you.

In Paris they banned driving for a little while because of the almost record high pollution. Drivers on Monday with even numbered license plates were not permited into the streets or would get a 22 euro fine, and the same deal to odd numbered drivers the next day. 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 cars were impounded for their reaction to the fine. It's not as easy for the people in Paris to get used to a car free community like the people in Vauban. Although the cogestion was brought down 60% in France's capital.

In Bogota, Colombia  millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during their car free day. This is their 3rd year of celebrating a day withouth cars in the capitol. The rain didn't stop people from participating either. This day, even just one day lowers their air polution and help realize the stress of driving. Two other cities in Columbia participated in this event, Cali and Valledupar.

The United States is also trying to make great changes to reduce green house gas polution. Statics show that people are buying less cars, driving less, and getting less license plates each year. With the changes and reduction each year, it will do great things to our envirmoent and the air we breathe. Although this would not help our economy, the car industry will be troubled. Driving by young people decresed 23 between 2001 and 2009. This could help us but also put our country more into debt.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A11EAD149116,"Limiting car usage can be very helpful not only to our environment, but to our culture. Our ozone is slowly getting worse and worse every year. A heavy contributor to the decay of the ozone layer is the greenhouse gasses, like the ones we emit from our cars on a daily basis. A society without cars could create a safer, more time friendly, and environmentally healthy community.

Think of all the tragedies that have spawned from car crashes. Just this year in our local community, a 16 year old boy was knocked off our local bridge and killed by a drunk driver. Our city is still recovering from this, not a day goes by where I don't see a new person leaving flowers in his spot on the bridge. In a society without cars, this would never have to happen again, think of all the potential lives that could be saved.

Think about how much time you spend in a car on the average day. At least 30 minutes to an hour if you go to school, a job, or a sport. If we didnt have to drive everywhere, everything we needed would be compacted into walking distance. Life would be so much easier if you didnt have to stress about getting up early enough to catch the bus, or for your friend's mom to pick you up. you could just casually walk out the door and be at your destination in no time.

Life without cars could be the change that our country needs. Improved environmental conditions, safety improving drastically, and your precious time being saved. Maybe life without cars wouldn't be as great as we're making it out to be, but how are we ever going to know if we don't try. This change would be for the better, and is exactly what America needs.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
0B269B19E080,"Suburban cities are buzzing with traffic; every person is trying to get some place as fast as possible. Whether it is a business meeting or their child's soccer practice, a car is the preferred transportation method. But there is a new initiative across the globe that is growing in popularity: the idea of living without cars. Several urban cities have participated in efforts to reduce the traffic in their home, because of the numerous harmful effects it has on the people and the earth. Three cities have subtracted cars out of their daily routine and reaped the benefits. The United States has also procured benefits because of the decline in car usage. In Vauban, Germany: citizens live without cars, in Paris, France: driving restrictions were placed to help control the pollution, and in Bogota, Colombia: an annual ""Day Without Cars"" is put into effect. These efforts have proven to have multiple advantages. The articles, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" and ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal, The United States and Vauban's unique situation is discussed. Robert Duffer explains Paris' predicament in his piece, ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog."" the final source is from Andrew Selsky, ""Car Free Day is a Big Hit in Bogota."" Limiting and abolishing the use of personal automobiles is helpful to the environment, the city, and the people.

When Paris, France is mentioned, people think of the Eiffel tower looming over their head. In reality, what is really dancing over their hair is smog. The classic city has experienced record high polution rates in the previous times. The government has decided to do something about their predicament. Duffer explains the measures they took, ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" The efforts that the French made to prevent pollution proved to be extremely successful. Because of the strange weather conditions, the smog had become trapped in a layer of air, causing their smog count to rival Beijing's, the most polluted city in the world. Paris adjusted to the bans by making all public transportation free and making certain exceptions for hybrid cars and cars carrying three or more people, Duffer explained. Although some deliery companies were not happy with the restrictions on their driving, the smog drastically cleared enough for the city to abolish the ban and all numbered plates were allowed to drive after only a week of the ban.

In a new and revolutionary city, cars have actually been banned from the premises. Vauban lies in Germany, near the French and Swiss borders. Aside from main thoroughfare, the streets are primarily car free. And the locals think that it pays off, ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way', said Heidrun Walter."" The motives behind this are due to the harmful greenhouse gas emission from so many cars. Rosenthal cites the statistic that, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas in Europe.. and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" With car-less cities like Vauban, the greenhouse gas emissions are close to nothing. Citizens walk, bike, or pile on the bus. This method helps protect the environment and have people enjoy their daily lives a bit more. In Rosenthal's other article, about Car Culture, she explains how the car industry is declining anyway, and how the United States could be headed for no-car societies as well. ""Car ownership per household and per person has started to come down in the past two to three years."" The abolishment of car usage helpe protect the environment and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.

In Bogota, Colombia, a new kind of celebration has been put into effect. The ""Day Without Cars"" is an annual day in the capital of Colombia where the use of cars is not permitted. Substitute activities include: biking, hiking, taking buses, and skating. Selsky wirtes that the goal was to encourage the citizens to use public transportation and reduce the pollution that clotted up the airways in the people. The only mode of transportation allowed was buses and taxis. There were twenty five dollar fines handed out to those who violated the rules. Selsky explains, ""The day without cars is part of an improvemewnt campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city."" These bicycle paths have helped to promote the non-polluting modes of getting around Bogota. The day has proven to be a success for not only Bogota, but other Colombian cities as well. On the third anniversary, Cali and Valledupar participated in the event as well. The capital city of Colombia has seen drastic changes in the condition of its city. Seltzky claims that recreational parks have popped up and the sidewalks have improved to put them in a better condition. Rush hour regulations have even been put into effect that have dramatically reduced the bumper to bumper traffic in the city.

Bogota, Paris, Vauban, and the United States have all proved that eliminating the usage of cars is beneficial to many aspects of the world. Each city has adapted it's own way that attests to the assets of not using cars.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
9869D38D9EDB,"Owning a vehicle or lisence is not what it used to be. Today, people all across the globe have given up driving for the many benefits that come along with alternative methods of transportation. These methods can reduce pollution, be cost effective, and even improve people's well being and happiness.

First of all, there is a surprising amount of options if you don't want to drive a car.

Public transportation such as trains and buses exist in most major cities, especially in America and Europe. San Francisco is a busy city with many young residents, and many of these residents are not interested in getting their liscenses. "". . . They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends."" Because so many options exists, many people don't feel the need to own a car anymore. Similarily, some cities and towns have been made specifically to be navigated by foot, like Vauban Germany. Towns like Vauban are tailored to fit its resident's needs in everyway. "". . . In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main streer, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" In Vauban, necessities are convieniently placed so that the town's inhabitents may acsess them with ease, rather than driving around the town.

However, alternative transportation methods are not the only reason to give up your car. By not driving a car, air pollution can be decreased drastically. In Paris, France's largest city and international destination, driving was temporarily illegal because of heavy smog in the city. "". . . Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" It did not take very long for traffic and smog to clear up once the ban was put in place, and the famous city began to look like itself once again.

People are also happier when they do not drive cars. ' ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" sais Heidrun Walter.'            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
EFB92CEDD7D6,"Going place to place in a car is surely the fastest way possible, compared to taking a crowded bus or train. Having your own car is very wonderful, you get to have the space to yourself no noisy people around you, you can turn the music all the way up if you wanted to. Yes, all that's great for you but, have you thought about the consequences? Well, not consequences per say but there are bad side effects to having a car. The biggest reason being is that heavy car usage can pollute the air and harm the environment as well as yourself. Some people think that cars aren't the biggest reason as to why the air is polluted, and use that as an excuse to keep driving. ""[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" quoted from source 2. The smog that was mentioned was from the over usage of cars in Pairs, smog that heavy could be toxic and very bad for your health. Heavy car usage does pay a strong role in the pollution that we have. Since most people who have a car use it all the time, I could just imagine how bad the air is right now.

Due to the high smog levels in Paris they had to put a ban on using cars, and if someone were to use their cars they would be charged a 22-euro fine which is $31 USD. This ban was later lifted to odd-numbered plates when the smog cleared enough. Pairs wasn't the only one to ban cars. As quoted from source 1 ""VAUBAN, Germany-Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars."" In Vauban, Germany they have completly taken away cars! Unlike some people who can't live without their car for more than 2 days, A whole community has been without one for much longer. "" 'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way' said Heidrun Walter,"" quoted from source 1. Without a car they have nothing to worry about and in term live much happier lives, they also save up money since they don't have to pay for gas, doesn't that sound good? Now, you don't have to go to the extremes of giving up your car completly but limiting the amount of times you use your car would be a fantastic start and if everyone around the world limits the amount of time they use their car by half, even by a quarter, the air around us would be much more clean and happy.

Alternatives other than using your car can be going on a train or bus, and yes I know I said that they can be a little unappealing, but I rather suffer a couple of minutes on a bus or train than having the long term effects of a polluted environment. Don't like the idea of going on public transportation? How about car pooling? If your friend wants you to drop them off somewhere that's on your way to work anyhow, give it to them, beats having them drive their car and get more pollution in the air. As stated in Source 4 ""I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don't really car. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn't work.""  BART is reffering to the Bay Area Rapid Transit. As you can see, even young people would rather take public transportation if available.

Cutting down car usage can also mean you get to go out for more walks than usual! Walking is very important for your health but also for the environment, since of course, walking doesn't cause pollution. As stated in source 3 ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" This all happend in Bogota, Colombia ever since their ""Day Without Cars"" started, their community and outdoor lives have improved dramatically. Walking can give you a chance to get some fresh air and cool your minds off things you might be dealing with. If you don't want to walk alone, walk with a friend and get to know each other better, don't just sit in a car talking on the phone with them, cars have made people less interactive. Invite your friend/s to go out walking with you, to a park, to the mall maybe catch a movie, or something else along those lines. Not only walking, but biking or skatebording can be a fun alternative, distract your mind with other activities or find a fun and enjoyable way for you to get you fom one place to the next, without the use of a car!

""But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter."" quoted from source 4. This is an amazing start for us in the US, we are slowly growing away from cars, or well, we seem to be a little less interested in them than we were years ago! We still have a long way to go, but, I strongly believe that going without cars or using cars less is a real benefit to our society, and to us as individuals.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
3D09DC6DA215,"Throughout the article, In German Subburb, Life Goes On Without Cars they are talking about certain advantages like, less air poluttion. The money running threw germany are going to better causes like placing walk aways on a main street. Cars produce a gasy smoke called ""smog"" which causes air pollution, which then forces plant growers to keep there plants in a green house to keep them out out of the polluted air. Emission from tail pipes not only hurt plants its also hurts animals, and if enough can hurt humans, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states"". By cutting down on car usage it can make cities denser and better walking. Another advantage of cutting down the usage of cars is people can also get more exercise, witch will cause people to be happier and more healthy.

The smog from cars has forced paris to enforce a ""partial driving ban"" to clear the air. If you were to drive your car on a day you werent supposed to then you would have to pay a 22-euro fine witch is 31 american dollars. Over 3,500 drivers in paris were fined and 27 people got thier car repossesed. Due to this enforcement congestion was down by 60 percent in france. Without as many cars highways and streets we less packed and probably less car accidents. This movement will lower air pollution drasticly and encourage more people to take a walk or take a bike ride. As years go by the number of people getting licenses are decressing and more younger people seem to be less worried about getting one.

Between 2001 and 2009 the percent of younger people driving has decressed by 21 percent. Younger people dont really care about the features of the car as long as it gets them to point A to Point B. This is good because they can make more fuel efficent cars that don't have all the speakers and lights. They can just focus on the reduction of air pollution. If they start to make the prices of electrical cars more cheaper they can probably start a movement that will alot of people to switch from gas powerd to battery powered. Which will also decrease the amont of air pollution.

With the decression of cars being drove they can focus on improving things like bikes, bike trails, and smoother side walks. This will make more people to do things and the can advertise them on t. v. Another advantage of limiting car usage is you might not have to pay for gay anymore, they will probably switch to hybrids. There will be charging places instead of gas stations, and it will also decrease the amount of noise the cars make. This movement probably wont fully end car usage but it will probably bring light to the things that need to happen future wise.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
80E78F9EB937,"An industrial world without cars may seem to be ages away, but according to the studies conducted in the passages, the reduction of car use is very positive culturally, environmentally, and even economically.

One advantage of a society without cars is a relief of stress. The residents of Vauban, Germany, a car-free suburban town, are much happier there. They don't have to deal with the pollution of gas emission or noise pollution from traffic; they simply hear bicycles swishing by and children playing.

Car free towns have been an intriguing idea for years now; even major organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation for America are willing to pursue car-free cities for many reasons. The major motivation for getting rid of cars is pollution. In Europe, 12% of gas emissions come from cars, and in some car-intensive areas in America, gas emissions from cars reach 50%. There was even a ban on driving in Paris for a short while when the smog became too hectic. That's a massive amount of pollution- an amount that can be greatly reduced.

Some countries are slowly getting on board with the whole ""car-free"" idea. In Bogota, there's a car free day where everyone takes alternative forms of transportation to get around, be it buses, bikes, or skateboards, which makes a huge difference in such a heavily populated metropolis. The citizens really enjoy this day, hinting that a car free life is more enjoyable. This car free day has even spread to other Colombian cities like Cali and Valledupar and will soon spread to other countries as well.

If a car free society is ideal, how come we don't have it yet? Currently, we still depend greatly on cars; giving them up wholly is a very radical change. However, governments are working into it slowly. On top of car-free towns like Vauban and car-free holidays like in Bogota, car-free cities are being planned. These cities would be very dense, making it easier to get around with a bike, on foot, or on public buses and metrorails rather than in a private car. This will reduce pollution greatly, spawn a healthier population, and even support local business growth now that local restaurants will be a walk away from one's home. Even today, cities have been favoring alternative transportation with tolls on cars that exempt bikes.

It is even evident in America that the amount of people getting drivers liscences has been dropping steadily. Culturally, everything is growing to be more local: carpools, public transportation, and the internet keep eveyone connected without having to use private cars.

In the final analysis, shifting towards a society that is less dependent on cars will bring about very positive results. People will be able to enjoy a more local, connected, and happier environment and nature will flourish too with the relief of pollution, both in the form of noise and gas emission. Hopefully, the reduction of car use will be well under way in the near future and we can progress, improving society and repairing the global ecosystem.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

I read a passage called ""In German Surburb, LIfe Goes On Without Cars,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. In the passage Elisabeth wrote about how Residents of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars. 70% of the families in Vauban do not own any cars, and 57% of the families there sold their cars to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Said Heidrun Walter as she was walked down the verdant streets. Vauban was completed in 2006, this movement of seperating suburban life from auto usage is called ""smart planning."" This movement can help a lot with the current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. This movement is happening all across Europe and the United States. Europe is responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe while it's up to 50% in the United States. Vauban is home to 5,500 people, it's basic precepts are being adopted from all around the world to try to reduce car usage, to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation. They're making stores a walk away on a main street, rather than in malls that are quite a distance. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting something new called ""car reduce"" communities.

In the second passage I read called, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer. In this passage Robert wrote about what happened in Paris; It enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog. Motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or get a 22-euro fine, odd-numbered plated cars would have to do the same the next day. With this in effect, 4,000 drivers were fined that's atleast $124,000 American dollars; Congestion went down 60%. With this partial ban the smog cleared up enough on Monday for the ruling of French Party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

In the third passage called, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky. In this passage Andrew wrote about a day in Bogota, Colombia and how this ""Car-free"" day impacted not only the City of Bogota but two other cities and probably another country. On the ""Car-free"" day in Colombia many Colombians hiked, biked skated or took public transportation. The goal of the whole event was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog or get a $25 fine. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. This event can start a chain reaction and inspire other countries and nations to take a step to reduce all the pollution being emitted into the atmosphere. For the first time in the three year spand the event was held, two there cities joined Bogota. Cali and Valledupar joined in on the ""Car-free"" day in Bogota, Colombia. ""These people are created a revolutionary change, and it's crossing borders,"" Said Enrique Riera Mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay.

In the last passage called, ""The End of Car Culture,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. In this passage Elisabeth wrote about how in America more Americans are buying less cars, driving less and less people are getting their Driver's Licenses. Driving decreased a 23% between 2001 and 2009. Experts say if this trend of buying, and driving less cars continue it'll be benefical implications for Crabon emissions and for the environment. The reduced usage and buyage of cars has a negative and a positive effect. The positive thing about it is that it's less pollution into the air, which means less Greenhouse gases, less traffic, and more safety; but it's negative effect is on the car industry their profits will plumet down quickly. As a result of this issue to the car industry Bill Ford laid out a business plan for a world with personal vehicle ownership is impractical; He's going to partner up with telecommunications industry to create cities where ""Pedestrian bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are a connect network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions adn improve safety.""

In Conclusion, all of these factors like creating communities where there is no access to cars, banning driving for a couple days, having a car-free day, or just coming up with ideas of making self-sufficent cars can all lead to less emissions into the air and creating less smog; reassuring the safety of pedestrians; and conserving resources.

Having a car may come in handy to some people because they are organize to have summer jobs and have social life around where they can walk and take public transportation or may even car pool with friends. People who do live in cities often take the bus, walk, and cabs if needed to.

Not all have cars in big cities because it cost more for gas and some probably can't drive. Since driving is becoming more big in life more teenagers and young adults are driving more often. Living in the suburbs you'll will need to drive because everything isn't close by each other it's more distance so maybe you'll probably have to walk or may ride a bike to get where your trying to go.

""With all these changes people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habbit.""  Well because they may feel that having something to do with a car may cost them alot. Not alot of people can afford cars and what the car needs for it to work properly instuff. People who did have a car were always intense because they never knew what can happen with the car.

Transportantion for America is a fast growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States. They want people in the community that live in the suburbs to pay more because using a car cost more than living in cities in that when your living in the cities you really wouldn't have that much to do because it's walking distance.

If your living on an island you probably wouldn't need a car that much because everything is like near or to close. Having a car on a island isn't really much needed to be honest you would barely use it which would be a waste of money for half of the stuff you may use to get on the car.                                    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Street parking, driveways and home garages are forbidden in the new district near the French and Swiss borders. The streets are completely ""car-free"", but downtown Freiburg car ownership is allowed but there is only two places to park- large garage, or a home. 70% of Vauban families do not own cars. A mother of two had said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" as she walks the streets where the swish of bicycles an chatter of children drown the occasional motor.  There's plenty of advantages of limiting car usage. It makes cities denser, and better for walking, planners now takeing the concept to the suburbs.  In a new approach, stores have placed a walk way on a main street, rather than in malls along some highway. Some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed contries but also in the developing world. The Enviornmental Protection Agency is promoing ""car reduced"" communites.

Cars not only take up space in our cities, and towns, but it also disturbes the peace, and pollutes our air. When you are walking down the road would you rather hear the noise of cars, or the calm enviornment nature has provided us? The air in most communities is so polluted that there is a fog that lurks over their community, not saying it's all because of cars but that is a big factor in the situation.  Reducing cars can reduce the number of deaths, pollution, and reduce noise. More space will be provided for our fellow citizens to walk upon and enjoy the community, roads will be safe to walk across and you wouldn't have to worry about a drunk driving accident. Limiting car usage can be more helpful to your community than it would to be increasing the numbers of cars.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
123F2E692087,"The Way In Which We Move

Here in America, with our ""broad expanses and suburban ideals"" (Rosenthal, para. 3),  the automobile is the way in which we move: it takes us to school, to the office, to our homes, to the homes of others, to distant, unexplored places. Entire buildings and businesses are dedicated to this wonderful invention. However, as American culture shifts and we focus less and less on the car itself, the advantages to limiting our use of this tool become increasingly evident: less polluted air, more cost-friendly alternatives, and the bonding of whole communities. This turn-away from a car-focused society could certainly change the American perspective on the automobile industry as a whole.

Cars, despite some of their clear advantages, cannot provide the necessary advantage of less-polluted air. Automobiles in the United States can produce up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in car-intensive regions; European passenger cars can produce up to 12 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Europe (Rosenthal); without cars, these greenhouse gas rates dramatically drop. One example of this is the temporary ban of driving a car in Paris due to record-breaking smog levels. According to an article by Robert Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog,"" and that colder nighttime weather and warmer daytime weather caused the warmer air to ""trap car emissions."" People from other countries also seem to be enthusiastic about limited car use and its effects. Carlos Arturo Plaza of Bogota, Colombia, who participated in his city's 3rd annual Day Without Cars, says that "" 'It's a good opportunity to...lower air pollution' ""(Selsky). In our own country, as Americans buy less cars and register for less driver's licenses, sociologists can conclude that ""it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"" (Rosenthal, para.6). A reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will allow cleaner air, which could eventually lead to healthier living standards across the globe, as well as healthier and more diverse ecosystems and biomes. With the limited use of cars, this could all be a possibility.

Not only will this restriction of car use allow for less air pollution, it could also lead to producing more cost-friendly methods of transportation. Cars and their accessories are often expensive to maintain and to purchase, so the creation of other ways to get around are a must to those who cannot afford such maintenance or purchases. In a passage by Andrew Selsky, he states that Bogota's Day Without Cars has allowed for the ""construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"", along with ""broad, smooth sidewalks"", to travel on. In the booming and populous city of New York, its bike-sharing program and ""skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls"" (Rosenthal) allow the world to see the shift towards cheap yet affective alternatives to transportation. Michael Sivak, research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, has a son who uses Bay Area Rapid Transit, even though it often takes longer than driving, simply because it is cheaper and a car is simply ""not a priority"" (Rosenthal). Alternative transportation is definitely on the rise as car usage becomes less and less of a trend.

While all of these advantages to limited car use affect us all, the one that will most directly and immediately affect people is the bonding of whole communities. When car use is reduced, there is more opportunity for interaction with others, whether it be through modern technology such as the cellphone or social media, or through face-to-face communication as seen in a good old-fashioned conversation between two people. Various factors, according to Mimi Sheller, professor at Drexel Unviersity, are accountable for this community bond: the Internet, which allows for connection with people without driving to meet them; the ""renewal of center cities"" to draw in ""empty nesters"" (Sheller, Rosenthal); as well as carpooling apps and services. Vauban, an entirely car-free suburb in Germany, has adopted a no-car policy in an attempt to separate suburban life and automobile use, an asset in a new project known as ""smart planning."" This separation allows its citizens to have more personal interaction, with its businesses being a short walk from their homes and less space to park a personal automobile. This compacted suburban example in distant Germany is also being adopted in some places in America as well, and it may eventually be the future of American suburb life. With these changes come more and more opportunity to delve a deeper connection with the citizens who live in your area.

America has long been pictured as ""one of the world's prime car cultures"" (Rosenthal). It's the home of many famous and renowned automobiles, including the Ford Model T and Detroit, Michigan, where Chrysler automobiles are manufactured and exported all over the globe. However, as the United States evolves into a different sort of country, so does its focus on the car. Restricting use of the car offers up many advantages to its citizens: less greenhouse gas emissions, more cost-friendly options to transportation, and the opportunity to bond with your community. As the American Dream continues to change, so will the way in which we move.                    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
46E51980E4FB,"Transpotation has been a key part of many socities around the world today; from getting to and from jobs, visiting familes, and running common everyday errands that life brings. But, in some areas, they are opting to go car-free, and in many ways, it is making positive impacts within these evolving areas. From lowering emissions and greenhouse gases, to providing a more stress-free way of living, opting out on cars can make huge positve effects that everyone should look into.

Cars, especially in the United States and other leading nations, have many suburban ideals that bring them to have one of ""the world's prime car cultures"". The U.S, for example, is the birthplace of the Model T, one of the first cars that was ever made. However, over the last decade, America's love for cars has gone down slightly, and is headed lower each year. Looking into the future, this shift could have great affects on today's socities; which includes letting off fewer carbon emissons into the enviornment. This decrease would happen because transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions into the atmosphere, just behind Power Plants. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases in  Lowering the amount of car emissions will additionally help achieve President Obama's goals of helping the enviornment and doing something good towards it during his time as President.

In addition, France is a prime example of how lowering the amount of cars on streets will have positive outcomes on the enviornment. Because of excessive amounts of smog in air in Paris, they came up with a clever system to reduce the amounts. An alternate day schedule is what was put in place, allowing motorists with even numbered license plates to drive one day, and odd-numbered drivers the next. Failure to leave their cars at home on the days that don't apply to them resulted in a 22-euro fine, which didn't stop some drivers. But, despite their reactions, the idea had many postive impacts and cleared the air of smog. Countries all around the world have seen the impressive facts come to life that reducing driving can lower the amount of emissions we put into the enviornment.

Limiting the amount of cars on the road also has other advantages other than the postive impacts it can make on the enviornment. Germany, for example, is experimenting by forbidding street drving, driveways, and home garages near the french and swiss borders (Vauban). As a result, 70% of Vauban's families do not even own cars and 57% sold a car to move there. One resident says ""When I had a car I always always tense. I'm much happier this way"".

Doing those things could even keep you healthy. pollution is getting  out control these days to much greenhouse gases in the air. its bad we needa do something before it can kill us. like in all of the passages it tells why not using cars is a great way a better way to not us cars.

in the first passage ""in german suburb, life goeson withoutcars"" people from vauban, germany are giving up their cars. they are now riding bikes or walking. 70 percent of people from there dont use cars. people are happy there. people are selling their cars to live there. yes you could drive a car but there is only like 2 parking spaces. you could buy a space for 40,000$ along with a home. they are just trying to help out to keep the air clean.

in the second source ""paris bans driving due to smog"" the city was almost about to reach their record pollution but they enforced a couple days banning to clear air. people would be fine 31$. but 4,000 people didn't listen. but people had their cars impounded for their reaction. diesel full was to blame since france tax policy favors diesel over gasoline. paris is the most pulluted city in europe. but good thing happened the smog cleared up.

in the source 3 ""car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota"" millions of colombians were biking, hiking, skated, or took buses. people would be fine 25$ if not following the law. it will help reuce the smog, the pollution. two other cities cali and valledupar have joined the event. people from other countries have came to colombia to watch this event. it is the straight year for this event. now since the event is going well more sidewalks have been made.

in the last source ""the end of the car culture"" says that america is now using lesser cars buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses. sociologists says it will be good for the enviroment and for beneficial implications for carbon emissions. but will be bad for car industrys.

using less cars is good thing because more socializing less accidents less pollution less greenouse gases. this would help you save money give you exercise. it could help the enviroment people would get better at being active. maybe the world should have a week once a year that  we don't use cars to lower pollution. escpecially bejing since it is the most polluted city in the world.                            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B87765D67542,"The world is advancing, technologies are being built, and the enviroment is changing. Imagine living in an area where there's a limited car usage. It might sound horrible but life goes on without cars. As to limiting your car usage it also has it's advantages. The advantages goes towards the people and the enviroment.

To start, everyone would know that the main reason is because of the state of our enviroment. There's a lot of pollution going out there in the world and it's not safe or natural. To give an example, according to the article, written by Elisabth Rosenthal, ""In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", passenger cars are responsible 12 percent of greenhouse gas and fifty percent in car-intensive areas in the United States. To exemplify, greenhouse gases is one of the causes for the changes around the environment. They're not the good changes either. To support this, the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", written by Robert Duffer, shows an example of Paris and China banning car usages due to their high pollution and smogs. Robert Duffer states, ""Congestion was down sixty perent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" In other words, polllution can hold a great affect of people trying to go to work, have fun, or even visit someone. Not only is change in the enviroment is bad but some people can just live without the use of transportation.

The continue to the advantages, the people get to spend their time with others more and even be happy just walking around. Going back to the article ""In German Suburb, life Goes On Without Cars"" written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a mother of two and media trainer,  Heidrun Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" To extend this, having a car would cause some people to be tense and stressed. Without the ability to do anything about it but just sit there or walk, it is much better to walk around with the people who's close. Another example would from the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selksy, another commentary made from a businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees with it. Carlos Arturo Plaza states ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In other words, not only is the car-free day works for helping improve the enviroment, it's good for releasing stress for few people.

To conclude, letting go of driving around may sound like a disadvantage but it's actually an advantage to those around us. It's an advantage for both the enviroment and us. Who wouldn't want a stress-free enviroment?            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
79A7736C33C6,"Limiting car usage is a great way for our pollution to decrease. With limiting cars we also will be able to walk place to place without being tempted to drive there.

Limiting car usage will clean up the pollution by a lot. There have been ""efforts in the plast two decades to make cities denser."" Some places have started to do that by limiting cars, and they have decreased the ammount of pollution where they live. Paris has ""enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" They only did that because days have been so close to near record pollution. They had limited the days people can drive and only after five days the congestion was down sixty percent. If there is a decrease in pollution the air would be much cleaner to breathe for everything, plants, animals and most importantly us humans.

The other good side of limiting car usage is that we can use other ways to transport and enjoy the outdoors by doing that. We can ride bikes or even walk from point A to point B. New York has started a bike program and it is skyrocketing. People can ride them to work or anywhere they want to go. People say ""the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of young people getting there licenses. Young adults that are nineteen and twentyone have not bothered to get a license, even though they live in a place where it can come in hand most of the time. How they can get away with doing that is that they have summer jobs not to far so it is in walking distance. Some people have a car but choose other ways to travel from place to place. ""Mr, Sivak's son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving."" There is other ways then taking a car.

Using other ways to transport is a good way to start cleaning up the areas yo live in. You can clean up the pollution dramaticaly. You can also just walk to where you want to go. If it's not in walking distance you can carpool, take a bus, or ride a bike.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Limiting your car usage is beneficial because you could potentially save alot of money. Every time you need to put more gas in the car thats fifty dollars down the drain. Saving fifty dollars a week actually adds up very rapidly and be used on something you will enjoy. Instead of buying gas you can go to the movies with friends, go iceskating or even out for dinner. Money is an important role in our economy today and spending a large amount on transportation regularly doesnt sound proper. Having more money is something im sure everybody would enjoy, especially not wasting it on gas money.

Not using your car is also benificial because you can get more exercise by walking or riding your bike where you need to go. Exercising is something everybody needs to do to maintain a healthy lifestyle and also staying active. Instead of driving your car park in in your garage on go for a nice relaxing bike ride.

We rely on our cars for everything, from getting to work or getting food to eat, our cars are what gets us there. But what would happen if we were banned from using our cars. Many places have banned cars, whether permanently or for just a few days, cars are being banned. Cars create stress, the also create harmful pollution, that damages our health and our planet. Another reason is that cars are naturally dying out and becoming used less, than before.

In a small community of residents, cars have been completely banned. These are people who gave up there cars to live in this car-free environment. This is an area of about 5,500 people who has gave up, or possible sold there car to live here. Many of the people find that it is more relaxing, than when they had to worry about their car. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" Heidrun Walter expresses, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" From a statistic taken from this area, it shows that 70 percent of people in Vauban do not own cars, the others who couldn't give up there cars completely had to pay $40,000, along with their house to buy a garage all the way at the end of the development. This has create a car-free. along with a stress free environment for the suburban pioneers.

Cars let out exhaust that is created from gasoline and diesel. This exhaust is also know as pollution, which damages our planet, along with our own health. In Paris, cars were banned partial because, of the dirty air in this world know city. For five days a terrible smog engulfed the city, leaving the people no choice but to not allow any cars to be driven, until this smog cleared out. According to the information from ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" almost 4,000 drivers were fined for continuing to drive there vehicles. The only exceptions to this car ban was plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying more than three passengers, which causes less pollution. After a few days the restriction of cars was lifted, and cars could be driven after all the smog cleared.

The last reason we should limit our use of cars is because everyone else is stopping car use. We see hundreds of cars filling up highways, parking lots, or just driving down the road. But what we don't realize is how much car usage has dropped. In the passage, ""The End of Car Culture,""  Adviser of Perspectives Doug Shorts explaining that "" As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" So are cars naturally dying out, or is there something that is causing it to drop so steadily? One theory is that many Americans can't afford a new car, also many unemployed people are not driving to work anymore. This leads to the question, are cars dying out, or are Americans just unable to get their hands on a new car?

We need to protect our planet and ourselves. With all this car usage, we are killing our planet and ourselves. We are releasing pollution into our air every time we crank a vehicle and drive. Then we proceed to inhale this infected air, which hurts us. Then we worry about our car, putting ourselves into stressful environment. This also causes harm to ourselves.

There are various actions being taken in this attempt, with some neighborhoods going as far as eliminating the use of their cars completely. No matter what actions are being taken, the real goal is to improve the planet and the quality of the air that we are breathing.

As mentioned before, one of the main goals of limiting car use is to improve our air by decreasing the amount of greenhouse gases being put into it. If you are driving your car to and from work every single day, and you live in a city where your house/apartment is about 10 minutes away, don't you think you could ride your bike every now and then? Even if you don't have a bike, you could try taking the bus, or maybe even a taxi. By riding your bike, you are eliminating the chance of putting out any greenhouse gases, and by taking the bus, you are reducing the amount of gas being put out.

Aside from improving the environment by limiting car use, you can also improve yourself. Instead of driving your car everyday, you can ride your bike to where you need to go (as previously suggested), and in turn get a small workout. Riding your bike works your muscles, especially your leg muscles, gets your blood pumping, and even reduces stress. If you start riding your bike, you could improve your health and just feel better overall. You can also avoid sitting in a stuffy car and breathe in some fresh air.

In the end, limiting car use seems to have more pros than cons, so it's easy to see why so many places/people have jumped on board with the idea. Even if cars weren't harsh on the environment, they're still bulky and expensive, being more of a hassle than anything else. Why wouldn't you want to limit their use?

In Bogota, Colombia they ban cars altogether. they go rid of the roads and made them into sidwalks. Now that people have to walk to get to their final destination a lot of people now go to the parks and to the sports centers that they have there.

9FEC87473F7E,"Imagine a world completely pollution free. A world with no worry about greenhouse gases or global warming. While it's highly unlikely that we will get to that point, we can still try to reach this perfectly healthy world. The are many advantages tolimiting car use, some of those advantages would be: reducing stress, reducing the amount of pollution, and saving money.

Stress is a feeling that everyone can relate to. Whether it be work, school, money, or home life stressing out about things is not healthy. There has been several studies showing that getting proper exercise has tremendous health benefits. The only problem is that no one ever seems to have time to work out or go on a walk. However, if you had to walk to get wherever you're going, you would easily recieve enough exercise to help lower your stress. Plus, driving can be extremely stressful. Without having to sit through traffic or deal with bad drivers an average person's stress levels would plummet. The first passage contains a quote from a suburban mom of two, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm so much happier this way.""

Recently, I feel as if all I hear about on the news is Greenhouse gases and pollution. Honestly, hearing about global warming is a frightening experience, almost like a glass of cold water being thrown in your face. 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are caused by passenger cars and in parts of the United States it's up to 50 percent! While car companies are helping by rolling out hybrid and electric cars, those cars are very expensive! Not everyone is willing to shell out that kind of money. By reducing car use, the harmful gases polluting our air will greatly decrease and places like Paris,France and Beijing, China (both ver heavily polluted places) can have clearer air.

Money. Money seems like it rules our world and it really does. Do you enjoy throwing moeny away? Of course you don't! Well, if you drive a car everywhere you go, you might as well be. Gas prices are high and it takes upwards of 50 dollars to fill the tank of the average car. Not to mention the price of the car itself! While you have to pay for gas, car insurance, maintence, and the bill for the car if it's not paid off yet, people who walk to work or to the store and don't own a car are saving thousands of dollars a year.

To conclude, when you reduce the use of cars you: reduce stress, reduce the amount of pollution, and save money. If you want to leave the planet Earth healthy and livable for the future generations, you should seriously consider ditching your car and buying a nice pair of walking shoes.

301EA5259E90,"""On your mark get set GOOO!!!"" Some people would miss the sound of NASCAR or other racing events. I personally feel that not having any cars would make the world a better healthier place to live in.

First off I feel that not having any cars would save people a lot of money. Just think what you actually need to pay when you have a car. Once a month you have to pay for a car payment (if it isn't payed off), insurance, and gas. Now think that you also need to have a lisence and have your car registered. In VAUBAN Germany residents don't have cars due to the fact that it costs $40,000 just to own a parking spot. 70 percent of the families there don't own a car and 57 percent sold their car just to move there. Now that is a way for the world to survive and now your wallet.

Next I will say how having less cars will affect the world's pollution. The people of the world rely on using cars wether it's to go to another state or just for a drive to the corner store. People have burned so many fossil fuels into the air that smog levels can reach record highs everyday. In Paris their was a day where they almost reached a record high and thye had to take half the people off the road and if they used their car anyway they would get fined. This caused the smog level to go down to a safe level after just five days. Smog can't go away over night do to warm daytime hours and cold night time hours and it would get trapped in an air pocket. But i guess this was just a close call.

My final reason to write would be due to the level stress driving has on people. Just think everyday you have a chance on dieing in a car due to an accedent. You just drive a metal cage at high speeds and have a chance of running into each other. When you are riding a bike you don't ever have to worry about runing into oter people all you think about is that you're having a nice time. Even when you're walking you don't have to stress about people running into you because its just walking. Besides walking is just human nature so why would we stress over it?

In summary I feel that not using cars is helpful due to not having to pay as much, their is less polution in the air and you tend to just be lessed stressed in general. Wouldn't you want to leave this a clean and stress free place?    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E7AA92F720EC,"Cars have been a part of our culture for some time now. Since Henry Ford created the Model T, we have been crazy about these machines. Molding, crafting, and improving since, we have come to know these as daily objects. However, with all the new and progressing theroies now, is there really a need for cars? Limiting car use cold be beneficial not only for the Earth, but also for people. Limiting car use can improve people's moods, can reduce pollution, and improve community interaction.

Firstly, limitng car use could in turn improve people's moods. In Vauban, Germany, there has been an experiment of great proportion. They are living a suburban life without cars. Not only is this community close and in touch, the people are happier. As mother of two Heidrun Walter stated, ""When i had a car in was always tense. Im much happier this way,"" it is showing that not having a car can really relax a person. Just think about it, no insurance, no car payment, no thinking if wil my car last until the end of today, just saving thousands a year and having a lot of stress put off.

Secondly, limiting car use can reduce pollution. Im almost certain we've all heard about Global Warming and Greenhouse Gases, and the devastation they do to our planet. Withou cars these problems are still present, but lack the massive numbers in which it was rising. Smog is a horrible kind of pollution that affects the biggest cities throught the world. Paris banned cars for an entire day to remove the amont of smog in the area. This shows that pollution can be stopped. Even though they only banned even numbered licenese plates one day and odd another pollution still went down. If all cars were banned then pollution would have gone down even further.

Lastly, limiting car use can improve community interaction. People now dont need cars for everything. They can walk, and take trains, and carpool. All these interactions strenghten the community. Walking makes people maybe wanna buy things from stores along the way and help local stores. Taking trains can create friendships and long lasting personal buisnesses. Carpooling cits down on emissions and reduces pollution. The community can do nothing but benefit from these.

In conclusion, limiting car use could be extremly helpful. It could improve people's moods, reduce pollution, and improve community interaction. Maybe someday we could actually get rid of cars and listen to the grinding of the pedals down the biking highways.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B51DFF531F7E,"In different cities like Germany cars are really not needed as much as there are needed in America. A city such as Vauban, where cars are rarely even used. Most places have area's for cars to be parked ""Forbidden"", Around the French, Freiburg, and swiss borders. Vauban's streets are completely ""Car-free"", except for main thoroughfare. There are places that allow cars , like Freiburg's Downtown and a few streets on one edge of the community. There only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, by this car-owners space where he bought for $40,000, along with a home. only 70 percent of Vauban's families don't own cars , and 57 percent sold one just to move there. Cars are rarely needed in Vauban that people are immune to it. Some people say they are Healthier and Happier than most with cars.

As she enjoys and loves to walk the verdant streets where the chatter of wandering children and the swish of bicycles just drown out the occasional distant motor. Vauban completed in 2006 , is an example of a growing trend in Europe. The U.S and elsewhere to sepreate suburban life from auto use, as a componet of movement called""smart planning"". Automobiles are the linchpin of surburbs, where middle class families from chicago to shanghai tend to make their homes. If you prefer a car instead of walking all over the place, there may be slight changes you will have to make towards your car.

David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the U.S.

More and more countries and cities are banning cars due to some of the cons that they do have , like pollution , leakings, car wrecks and many of congestions on streets and highways. There having more car-free days than anything else , cars are just not that important anymore in Europe. The end of the car culture is literally coming to an end.

A4436AA84662,"There are several advantages in limiting car usage. It helps the environment, lowers the chance of crashing, removes stress, and also congestion.

A reason why limiting car usage is beneficial is that it helps the environment. In source 2, France reached several days of ""near-record pollution"". This is mainly because of the substantial numbers of cars in France. Since France is dependent more on Diesel rather than gasoline, it emits more pollution causing smog to be more evident. In paragraph 14, it states, ""...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."". China has far more than triple the population of France. Yet, France is able to reach the same level of smog as China. If an abundant amount of people continue to drive cars as the way they do, every country is going to have the smog problem Beijing and France are having. Also possessing so much smog is a safety hazard being that it limits your ability to see from a distance.

In addition, limiting car usage can reduce stress. In source 1, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, said "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."". In source 3, Carlos Artuto Plaza quotes "" its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". It is not only one person who can vouch on the reduction of stress by limiting car usage. A woman in Germany and a man in Colombia can both agree on the idea that limting car usage reduces stress. When you dont drive a car as much you have less things to worry about. Like, Fearing the possibilty of crashing, running out of gas, dealing with traffic, and several more problems. If someone drives less you would have less stress (in theory). The idea of stress reduction is an amazing advantage someone recieves if they limit their car usage.

Reducing car usage can also lower congestion. In source 2, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after 5 days of intensyfying smog..."". The implication of limited car usage brought the congestion down 60 percent. That is a major advantage since there is a decrease in the number of cars on the streets. This reduces traffic and allows people to reach their destination sooner than they would if it was more congested. The drop in congestion means that there are less cars on the streets so there would be a lesser chance of crashing. This is a factor that can reduce stress. The reduction of congestion is a positive product of the limitation of car use.

In closing, the limitation of car usage gives the advantage of aiding the environment, reducing the likelihood of crashing, stress, and congestion.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
BD304A35EE44,"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. The ways they are limited are not driving your car everywhere you go, not having your car at all and just ride the bus or bike.

This quote indicates thats people from Freiburg did not have a cars or they didn't use them.

Some may say that having a cars free day is a good thing according to Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. In that source in paragragh twenty four Carlos Arturo Plaza made a great point which reads ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

08C9F6BF31B4,"Today, many people all around the world rely too heavily on their cars.  There are many great reasons that car usage should be limited.  Car usage should be decreased because owning a car can be stressful, dangerous, and cars give off unwanted gas and pollution.  Although cars have been used for many years, it is not too late to take action on this problem.

Many people today would agree that buying and maintaining a car is very stressful.  It is very expensive to own a car, and it takes a lot of hard work to keep the car in good shape.  ""I am much happier this way,"" states Heidrun Walter (Rosenthal, 3).  Walter states that she is much happier without a car due to all the stress that comes with owning a car.  Walter also states that while she had a car, she was ""always tense,"" (Rosenthal, 3).  This is probably because of the expenses and time she had to sacrifice while trying to take good care of her vehicle.  This includes buying the car, paying for gas and insuance, repairs, and washing it.  People will save themselves a lot of time and money if the amount of car usage is limited.

Not only are cars are stressful to maintain, but they are also very dangerous to operate.  People run the risk of severe accidents every day when they drive their car.  In Source 4, the author states that new forms of public transportation will ""improve safety,"" (Rosenthal, 43).  The most occuring accidents are car accidents, which happen everyday.  Families will have to worry less about losing people they are close to.  There will be less unecessary accidents, such as drunk driving, and using phones while behind the wheel.  By reducing the amount of drivers on the road, the risk of these accidents will become much lower.

One last reason that car usage should be limited is that cars give off lots of unwanted gas and pollution into the air.  Recently, Paris faced ""near-record pollution,"" (Duffer, 10).  This was caused by the extreme amount of emissions from their cars.  The main cause for people wanting to reduce the use of cars is because of this unhealthy gas.  Cities all over the world are making efforts to help reduce and prevent the emissions.  The only way to do this is limit the usage of cars.  ""Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions,"" (Rosenthal, 34).  If the change can be made, then it should, in order to keep the environment safe.  There isn't much time before the pollution gets out of hand.

Although so many people rely on cars so much, they do not see the advantages of not using them.  Most people don't put into consideration how harmful these vehicles are to the environment.  On top of that, they cause uneeded stress and danger.  Because of these reasons,  the usage of cars should be limited.

D5B1241C2FB2,"Everywhere you look and everywhere you walk you hear a car or truck going down the street and you think to yourself, why cant they walk or bike rather poluting the air. With that in mind, there are several ways into limiting car usage. Some envole not getting a drivers license. some evolve banning car usage on specific days.

In the first source it talked about how german residennts given up there car's. And this new district forbides the idea of street parking and home garages and driveways. So what this community is showing is that there starting a new trend to get other countries envolved in this idea to start limiting car usage and green house gasses. Car ownership is allowed in that community, but you would have buy a space in a large garage's for $40,000 along with a house.

In the third source, in Bogota Colombia millions of columbians started to hike bike skate and or take the bus to avoid traffic jams. Bogota has been continuing the ban of NO cars excluding buses and taxis for three years. The reason why they did this is to promote an alternative for transportation and to reduce smog. People who don't follow this will pay a fine for $25.

In conclusion the idea on limiting car usage will benifit you in a good way. You won't have to spend thousands of dollars on a car. It will help preventing more green house gases. And it will help reduce the number of people who drive a car. So who knows when the world will change their minds of driving and owning a car we will not until we incounter something that would change the environment's or even the world.                   ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F2EC1D444393,"The message coming from these four passages is that with the amount of driving it's causing what some say ""smog"". The ""smog"" is caused by the amount of cars, all the exhaust is bad for the air. In the first passage, second paragraph it states that some people gave up there cars. There's not a lot of driving and there's only two places to park, a large parking garage at the end of the development and if someone buys a space for $40,000 which comes with a home.

In the second passage ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" they enforce a small ban on driving to clear the air of the city. During the couple of day that this occured 4,000 people were fined for $31 for not leaving there cars at home, along with the 27 people who had their car impounded for their reaction to the fine. After five days of no cars, the smog in the air had decreased. After about a week the smog had cleared enough for them to clear the ban.

In the third passage ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" it says they went three years with only taking buses or taxis for the Day Without Cars in a city of 7 million. If people drove cars they were fined just like the people were in Paris, only in Bogota it was a $25 fine. Some people in the city of Bogota state ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". New places have been built, old things were made new in this city, it seems to be a better place there.

In the last passage ""The End of Car Culture"" It talks about the driving and the cars in the US. Studies show that Americans are buying fewer and fewer cars, less driving, and less people are getting their licenses as the years pass by. Since 2005 the number of miles has been dropping year after year. many sociologists believe that if this type of pattern continues it will have benefits for the carbon emissions and for the enviorment around us.

FD175811A893,"Limiting motor vehicle transportaion by simply carpooling or just riding a bike to work or wherever it is that your doing would be such a great advantage not just to you, but also to the environment.

One main reason limiting motor vehicle transportation would be the best thing to do for the environment is because of the fact that, for example the exhaust of the vehicles in a densly populated area would cause a lot of physical damage to parks or gardens. The gasses that come out of the exhaust prevent full healthy growth of plants, which in terms means less trees and we need trees to help turn carbon dioxide into oxygen so we can breathe. It also helps us to breathe better if we could all just carpool with friends because it would cause less vehicles to be out on the road and in turn create an environment where all those chemicals aren't coming out of as many cars.

Besides just the fact that it would create cleaner air for us to breathe, the fact also remains that it would also be safer to drive everywhere without getting into a car crash. Car crashes are one of the leading causes of death for people all over the world, but if people stop driving their own cars everywhere there wouldn't be as many cars on highways, intersections or any other roads, there would be much less congestion making it easier to see what is around the vehicle you are traveling and it'll help save lives.

But limiting motor transportation doesn't only help out with the environment, it also helps out with your budget! If you were to sell your vehicle and ride a bike to work everyday or just catch a ride with a friend or relative, you won't have to worry about your payments on the car. You wouldn't have to pay for your car insurrence, your actual monthly payments,for any repairs on your car incase of an accident, and since you won't have a car you won't end up with any tickets for speeding or parking in the incorrect spot(s). The only thing you'd have to worry about is giving a $20 to whoever takes you to work that week.

If people would ride a bike to school, take a public bus to work or simply walk to their destination, it lower emissions, conserve resources, and it would improve safety in general.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Cars have been the most reliable resource in transportation allowing people to go where they need to but it seems like its going down. More people buy less cars and travel without polluting a lot. Many countries took the initiative to have car free days and see how life is like.

Vauban, Germany is an example of a car free society gaining more and more residents. Limiting our car usages is more efficient then using them everyday. Try taking the bus or ride a bike and see how much better it is then being cramped in a car. 70 percent of Vauban's residents don't own cars and 57 percent sold theirs to live in Vauban. Hiking and other alternaives for travel are growing while cars are reducing. Sometimes people can't afford cars or rent one for usage.

Many countries are trying to reduce the usage of cars to clear pollution and allow more ways to travel. Beijing, China is the most polluted city in the world from all the cars and factories they have there. Paris even realized they needed to cut back on car usages and banned odd and even license plate cars usages knowing the smog and pollution was rivaling China. In a week the smog cleared enough for cars to be used again. Cars have a huge impact on civilization.

Bogota, Colombia's Car-free day is a big success. It was a great way to take away stress and lower pollution.

These gases that our vehicles give off are polluting our air to the point where its harmful to live here. Because of this, I feel that we need to limit car use throughout the United States.

In doing this, I honestly feel like we can stop the pollution, or at least slow it down. Eventually there will be technological advancements that will help us solve problems such as this. But until then, we need to come up with a plan to slow down car usage and air pollution.

Our people are also becoming more lazy as the progression of cars continues. What im saying is people would rather ride around in a car over getting outside and walking and enjoying our surroundings. This effects the world more than you think. The more lazy and out of shape people are, the less jobs can be filled because theres not someone in shape enough to handle it.

When it comes to greenhouse gasses, remember that there is carbon monoxide, which is a greenhouse gas, coming out from the tailpipe of the cars. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, they make up to 50 percent of greenhouse gasses that polute. It is important to reduce the amount of gasses that enter the air through cars, so limiting car usage would help to limit the amount of gasses that have entered the atmosphere.

Another problem that is issued with car usage is traffic safety. There have been many car accidents and crashes in the United States, as well as many other areas in the world. It would be safer if people walked, biked, hiked, skated, or even took buses to places that they would need to go. Limiting car usage would also greatly reduce the number of accidents. It would also lower stress as well for people who are easily tense and stressed. If you are riding a bike or walking, you don't necessarily want to hear the sound of motors and engines. If they limit the amount of car usage, there would be less tension and more relaxation to those who would chose not to use a car. Also, riding bikes, walking, skating, or hiking can be a great workout for outdoorsmen who want to do something active, instead of sitting in the car getting from point A to point B.

Limiting the number of cars, or the ammount of times that we spend in our vehicles daily would cause great improvements in the economy and society. This could help preserve the environment and the safety of people as well. It all comes down to less car usage and spending more time walking, or even doing excercise.

As car dealerships made better looking, faster, high performance cars, the more people wanted them. After World War II when cars became inexpensive, more and more people had them. But it's also becoming an issue. Recently, that trend is going down.

To begin, the car industry has been at an all time high. We're making cars so fuel efficient, it almost seems impossible. We even have hybrid cars, which run on electric and fuel (respectively). But with all of the cars out there, especially in the US, the pollution in nations and our own cities are at an all time high. China's air pollution is the worst in the world. Nations have been taking the initiative to partially ban car use for a few days. Paris for instance, banned motorists with even-numbered license plates from using their vehicles, switching to odd-numbered the following day.

Furthermore, we have Bogota, Colombia who took a different approach to the rising air pollution. Instead of what Paris did, they banned automobile use in general, for one day. Buses and taxis still ran, but private vehicles did not. This seeminly little feat over time has done wonders on the city. More and more cities, including nations, are beginning this practice.

To sum things up, we see that there are advantages (and of course disadvantages) to limiting car use. Companies may lose money if they transport items. But as a whole, it's only a few days. Or even one day, that no one drives a vehicle. It's a perfect time to ride a bike, and lower air pollution in a city.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
3839A3000D18,"""Hey citizens, im here to tell you the advantages of limting car usage."" Imagine a life without car usage. Your life will be alot easier and less tense. You can only park your car in the garage or if your a car owner you can buy space along with a home. Stores are now moved out the malls and put a walk way and on a main street. People can walk, bike, skete, or take buses to work or school, leaving the streets free of traffic jams. Let me tell you why these 4 reasons are important.

Your life will be a lot easier and less tense without car usage. You can be able to ride your bike on the streets without cars. You can walk out your house and take a walk without having to worry about a car behind you. Even kids can play safe outside now when the are not out there. That why your life will be easier and less tense.

You can only park your car in the garage, or if your a car-owner you can buy space along with a home. There will be a lot more room on the streets. The streets won't seem so crowded as always. You can't have home garages, driveways, and you can't street park, they are strictly forbidden. That is why they made this rule.

Stores are now moved on a main street and a walk away. This is a great purpose for people who likes to walk and jog. You don't have to worry about traveling far to reach certain stores. You can walk out your house and go to any store of your choice. The main street is also helpful, thats where all the big marketing stores are. A great idea made for everyone.

people who walk,bike,skate, or take buses to work or school is another way to transport. If you live near or far from your job or school you can do the following I listed. Doing this helps delay traffic jams so it won't be any collisions on the road. With this in effect, parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city. The whole world should have a car free day.

These are the advantages of limiting car usage. Your life will be a lot easier and less tense. You have to park in a garage or if your a car-owner you can buy space along with a home, this makes more space on the road and suburban streets.

6EE4F2148153,"For some people having a car is a neccesity, but for others it can just be stressful. I believe it is much safer with out cars. There would be less accidents ,

less pollution and it would save people a lot of money .

In Paris they had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the smog. If there were drivers out on the road they got fined. This didnt stop everyone, there was counts of 4,000 people being fined for driving. Just five days after the partial ban congestion went down 60 percent.

Just Imagine if five days of no driving caused congestion to go down 60 percent, how much would it go down if cars were eleminated all together.

There are some disadvantages to not having a car. Such as not being able to get where you need to go on time, biking or walking far places, getting sweaty before work or school ect.

Driving can also be very stressful, for example when businessman Carlos said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"". This statement suggest that it is stressful to drive a car.

In conclusion, I would definitally want to have a car so i could get where i needed to go on time. I would also like to reserve the car only if i really needed to use it.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
2C46F90754CE,"People in today's society practically depend on their cars to get them to and from work, to buy groceries for their families, and just for the purpose of getting out of the house. Although, with billions of people driving cars every single day, it has quite a negative effect on the environment. It is in our nature to think that without a car, you could not go anywhere or do anything for that matter. Recently, cities around the world have been banning the use of cars and charging citizens with fines if cars become in use. The reasoning for this is the increased amount of pollution that diesel fuel is causing. Thus, making it difficult to breathe, walk outside, and live our everyday life.

One major problem in the use of diesel fuel has been the pollutants in the air which lead to an extreme amount of smog. Recently, Paris has had more smog than any other European capital. They knew that something had to be done to stop this, so they started a new ""car-free"" law. This resulted in a fine of $31 for the citizens who used their cars. Soon after that law had become intact, almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and just about 27 people had their cars impounded that day for their reaction to the fine.

The United States of America had long been one of the world's most prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of some of the very first car models. A lot of big cities in the U.S have a huge amount of driving going on. For example, New York City, San Fransico, Miami, Los Angeles, ect. This is leaving the country with a large amount of pollutants in the atmosphere. After President Obama's ambitions to decrease the amount of diesel fuel use, recent studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and are even having a decrease in the amount of licenses permited as each year passes. In 2013, the amount of miles driven per person was about 9 percent under the usual American peak. With the large amount of citizens living in this country and the number of people only rising, this small decrease has had a very positive effect on the environment.

With almost the entire world in on this new, ""car-free"" trend, people have been perfectly fine letting go of their cars and taking on the world just by foot. In the city of Vauban, Germany the citizens there would much rather pioneer their way through life than to own a car according to Heidrun Walter, who is a resident of Vauban. ""I'm much happier this way."" She claims. Back on the other side of Earth, people are becoming more and more encouraged to use plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying 3 or more passengers. This decreases the amount of fuel being burned, and a happier and healthier environment for us all to live in.

In conclusion, I believe that the decrease in the amount of cars in use has recently had a very positive effect on our environment. This has all come to show that you don't always need a car to get where you want and to do the things that you need to do. Or, if you feel the need for a car that you can rely on a friend for carpooling or purchasing a plug-in car which are becoming much more popular and useful in today's society. Always remember to keep our environment happy and healthy, and always making each day better by putting the amount of diesel fuels burned by car use and the effects it has into consideration.             ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
17D5674286DA,"Limiting car usage is a good idea. Limiting cars usage it a wonderful idea for many reasons. most people have the ability to live there life without cars, this would help cut back on pollution, and for most people it would be cheaper. Although some people may see this as a impossible way of living some of us do not.

To begin, people can live without cars people have done it before us and eventually people will do it after us. As shown in source 1 these people in Vauban, Germany have given up a life of cars for a simpler much quiter life in the suburbs. Life in this city has been condensed down into a one square mile area where people are able to go on with there everyday lives without having to get into a car to go somewhere. Life in this city is does not go completely without cars if these people need to leave the city they can simply walk to their very own parking space in the parking garage right on the outskirts of the city. these people have the ability to keep there cars but they have to buy a parking space when they buy there house you also generally wouldnt need your car unless you were going on a long drive that required you to leave the city. There is also the fact that there will be a day soon when we run oout of fossil fuels and what is a fossil fuel? gas. there will soon enough be a day where we dont have any gas and we will not be able to drive cars everywhere that we want.

Next, this would be one of the most effective ways to cut back on pollution. as shown in the 2nd source paris was struggling with a very bad polution problem that they needed to deal with. Paris was having the same sort of problem that beijing, china is having and beijing is the most poluted city in the world. so they banned all the cars that ended in a even number on monday and a odd number on tuesday. Just doing this for one day cut the amount of pollution in half. Imagine our worldwide polllution levels if driving was limited. The second largest form of pollution is cars so limmiting driving could even drop cars a few ranks back. Every part of getting to fossil fuels that fuel our cars is more and more pollution. gas is a very large pollutant and it causes alot of problems for our nation and one day there will be no more gas.

Furthermore, limiting driving would almost be cheaper for the people as talked about in source 4 less and less people have been getting there liscenses and driving cars because it isnt needed as much anymore. there are more ways of public transit that people are taking advantage of such as the mans son who takes the Bay Area Rapid Transit instead of driving his car. some might say that taking these other forms of transportation might take longer and yes they might be right but they are also much cheeper instead of having to pay a large amount of money to first, buy a car and then, buy gas. which the gas prices only seem to be going up lately. They have the ability to buy cheep tickets for the ride on the train or maybe a bus. As i spoke about earlier we will one day run out of fossil fuels. Gas is a fossil fuel and leading up to the time where we wont have gas anymore the gas will just keep getting more and more expensive because the less gas we have in our community the more that it will cost. also the more that people will want it one day most of us will not have the money to drive cars not because of the cost of the car but because of the cost of the gas.

Coming to a end, there are many other ways to travel other than buy a vehichle and some may be easier for you cheeper for you or better for the environment so why keep on hurting the environment when you could simply make the world a better place by just not driving a car. there are many reasons to limit driving but we could easily do it because people can live without cars, it would help the environment and cut back on pollution, it would also be much cheeper.

0AE68ED6D7D5,"In the passage ""Car-Free Cities"" Have many advantages, but i feel that the main advantage is that it is good for the planet and to lower air pollution and aslo the movement is actually working.

Helping out the planet and staying green in some way is a good thing because it helps our planet look better not only that it makes it look better but it also makes us humans and the planet Earth healthier for example the air pollution can be lowered by driving cars less,instead od driving your own car you could take the bus,walk, or ride like in the text it says

""Its's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.""

I like this piece of evidence because it tels more on how being green can not only help the planet but alo tell how it can help human kind, because it helps you understand not only it can lower pollution but it can also lower your stress, but if you choice not to go along with the movement you shouldn't have to pay a fine of 5$ because to me it seems like that would be taking away a persons rights yes i get it ""

The goal is to promote altnative transportatin and reduce smog""

but a person should not be force to do so.

Another advantage could be that the movement is working

""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

All in all this passage have many good advantages to help persuade people to start driving less and helping out our planet, One it is good for our planet because no one wants to live in a dirty place, Two it will help lower the bad air pollution, and Lastly is that the movement is working anyways so why not try and help out and drive a little less?                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
223953C21800,"Throughout the decades of humans being on earth, we have evolved into a higher innovating society. We have designed technologies that ceased to exist one hundred years ago. Us humans designed ""touch-screen"" phones, the internet, and much more. Througout the decades we started advancing through technology and we keep perfecting every device and/or engine on the planet. For example, a car is a major part of the human society. We use cars to get from place to place and we're always making new versions. If you look back during the 1930s-1950s, cars weren't used as often we use them. If you were to look around, you would see families, men, and women walking alongside the road. During that time period, cars were not used constantly unless it was neccessary. Presently, many people believe that humans should limit car usage. There are some countries that banned cars for a short time period. such as, Paris,France and Bogota, Columbia. There are also some areas that completely banned car usage forever. Take Vauban, Germany as an example; they have decided that no one should use a car because it would be better for them. I second that motion; We should most definitely limit car usage because it is better for the earth and we would be saving loads of money. Not to mention that limiting car usage IS safer.

Limiting car usage would be making a statement. Many people would never stop using their car, but what they are not considering is if we stop using cars, we would be helping the earth. Pollution has become so horrible throughout the year. Now that there are scientists and experts that are making new cars every day, we cause a lot more pollution then you know. Beijing, China is known as the most polluted city in the world. The people that live there have to wear a mask so they don't inhale the smog. Smog consists of smoke and fog from engines and exhaust I would think that people should take that to account because who wants to live in a world where you can't even breathe safely in? Instead of making more fueled engines, we should be making more electric powered engines, or ""hybrids"". There are a handful of Hybrid cars around, but they are insanely expensive.

Moreover, limiting car usage would save us money. Instead of paying gas fees of 70 dollars and up, we can just carpool, ride the bus, walk, or even ride a bike.

Although, If we do limit car usage, it would be a bad busnes for car dealerships like Ford, Honda, and much more. Saving money can go a long way in America. With all the money you save you could pay for college tuition, buy enough food for multiple families, or anything that you want (depending how you save or spend the money).

Many people also believe that limiting car usage will help with stress and worries. People should take the time to walk to a closest friend's house and relish the nice oxygen that you breathe in. With the way it's looking now, we won't be breathing in oxygen for long, but mainly car emissions.

Furthermore, no cars equals safety. Many people pass away or becom seriously injured because of car accidents or getting hit by a car. If we do stop car usage , it would be safer to walk alongside the road and not be afraid of reckless drivers. There are people out there who won't even come out their house from fear of getting hit by a car or getting in an accident. There are many other safety precautions and dangers in the world, but limiting car usage could help a lot.

To conclude, every citizen across America should take account that fuel powered cars are a hazrd to the earth. Without fuel powered cars, we could do so much for the world and for ourselves. We would be saving money and we would be making the streets a safer place to be.                    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

2EF2B21E048B,"There are a lot of advantages of limiting car usage. Yes a lot of people use cars to get around, but there are other ways to get around. Limiting car usage would probably cause a lot of complaints, but I think once people started limiting how much they drove everyday, they wouldn't see the need as much.

In Paris, for example, they have banned driving due to smog. The story ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer states that ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the captial of France, after five-days of the smog."" Only five days of banning drivers brought the smog rate down 60 percent, that's huge. To make it easier for the people of Paris to get around, they had public transit free of charge for those five days. If driving was banned for a while people woould find other ways to get around, and other people in the community would help them, like the transit bus giving free rides those five days.

Some people may argue that it's a free country and we shouldn't be limited to how much we're allowed to drive our cars. Yes it's a free country but limiting car usage is actually getting people to be active, instead of being lazy and driving everywhere you go. The United States has the highest percentage of obesity. With limiting how much you can use your car it will make people walk places, if they really have to go somewhere. Also riding a bike, or even riding a bus or train. However, unlike your own car, to get to the bus stop or train station, it will take some walking, which is good.

Also another advantage of limiting car usage would be all the things that would be fixed around our community. With people walking more, the community and city people would want to make our area look better while we walk. In the story ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" Andrew Selsky states, ""..Pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" With less driving and more walking to get to places, the community would fix our sidewalks and make more shopping centers and resraurants closer.

Limiting car usage will be hard to adjust to at first, but I think in the long run it's a win-win. It helps us get active and lower our stress from driving, and it helps our environment.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
EBDA2B6B95A6,"Car usage has impacted the earth in numerous ways; both for good and for bad. Ever since the production of the car during the industrial revolution, transportation from place to place was easier for everone to be able to go to work, school or on a vacation to a distant place. This invention has changed American life as well as the lives of many others in the world. Although, the creation of the car did have some downfalls. Passenger cars are responsible for the 12% of greenhouse gasses that are emitted into the earths atmosphere. Limitting car usage would be beneficial to the earth because it would help to lessen the damaging gasses being submerged into the atmosphere.

Reducing the use of your car would make navigation on the street much easier. For example, ""in this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. With the reduction of cars being enacted store are able to be in street for easy access. This allows for stock to be brought up because many of the stores wont be a long, stressful drive away. not only stores but work would be much closer and wont involve long hours in a car every morning.

Since there will be no car usage involved, the streets will be much safer to roam. The accident rate in decrease drastically. lessening the use of cars will allow for traffic to be cut in half. This would help to decrease the death rates that are caused every year. No driving would be beneficial for many. There will be no drunk drivers making the streets an unsafe place to be. the world will be a much better place to live in once cars are limitted.

Decressing the use of a car would make life less stressful. People wont have to worry about driving long hours, paying off their cars or worrying about car maintainence. This will make life easier to focus on much important tasks such as school an his of her career. Thats less payments and more money for something else. Removing this machinery would allow for the debt rate to drop as well. Less people will be bankrupt and have money in their bank accounts to save.

Lessening car usage would allow for a cultural shift occur, and change the way people live their life all over the world.

E8D55D0C4BAF,"Think about how many times a week we get in a car to drive somewhere. I know I drive to school, to lacrosse practice, and to spend time with friends on a weekly basis. Some people may claim that driving is a possitve aspect of our culture because it allows us to get from one place to another and accomplish tasks in a timley fasion, but driving in excess has some serious consequences. Although some may argue that it is impossible to completely cut out an action that is essential to our daily lives, and that cutting down on driving would not be adventageous, limiting the amount of time we spend driving has many advantages. Cutting down on automobile use will decrease pollution in our air, and make us healthier and happier, which is why many legeslators and cities are reducing automobile use.

Beijing, China, is the most polluted city in the world according to Robert Duffer of the Chicago Tribune in 2014. (source 2 paragraph 14) This is due to the fact that Bejing's automobile use is extremly high. When the city of Paris was faced with a similar crisis, it issued a partial driving ban that allowed people to only drive on days that the government said they could in accordance to their lisence plate number, or they would face a fine. (source 2 paragraph 10-19). This revolutionary ban caused the air pollution in Paris to drop so much that the ban was lifted after only one day. The drop in air pollution clearly refutes the claim that cutting down on driving is not adventageous. Cutting down on automobile use is beneficial to the environment because, according to Elizabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times in 2009 (source 1 paragraph 5), ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" Limiting automobile use is crucial to cleaning our air and stopping the burning of fossil fuels, thus explains why is beneficial to limit our car use.

Although some might argue that driving a car to work is easier, evidence shows that people who limit their car use are happier and healthier. Rosenthal writes about the city of Vauban, Germany, where ""70% of Vauban's families do not own a car."" (source 1 paragraph 3) Heidrum Walter, a carless citizen from Vauban, states that, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" (source 1 paragraph 3) The concept of people being happier and healthier without cars is further proved in Bogota, Columbia, where, according to Andrew Selsky of the Seattle Times in 2002, ""For the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million."" (source 3 paragraph 21) Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opprotunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""as he rode his bike with his wife. The statements from Walter of Vauban and Plaza of Bogota show how limiting automobile use is advantageous to the overall well-being and happiness of people, thus we should limit our automotive use.

Limiting automobile use is so beneficial, that many groups and legeslators are supporting a society with less cars. The EPA in the United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act. (source 1 paragraph 9) David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, states that, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Sociology proffesor at Drecel University, Mimi Sheller, further elaborates, stating, ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift."" (source 4 paragraph 35) The support for a ""car reduced"" society by the US government and the EPA is the cherry on top to all of the benefits associated with driving less, thus we should limit our automobile use.

Society is changing. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. (source 4 paragraph 41) Now is the time to turn off the engine, get out of the car, and take a bus, bike, or train to work. By limiting our automobile use, we keep our air clean by burning less fossil fuels, and we are happier and healthier, which is why organizations like the EPA support the reduction of car use. We need to act today to save the next generation of citizens from ecological destruction. The benefits of reducing car use are countless, which explains why we should limit our automobile use.                                                    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Car-free day left the streets free of traffic jams. Once Bogota stated to reduce car usage, they replaced the narrow, uneven sidewalks with smooth, wide ones. Throughout the city new restaurants, shopping districts, and even parks and sports centers have bloomed. About 7 million people participated in Bogota's Car-free Day.

The car banning started on a Monday. Drivers who did not comply were fined 22-euros ($31). Nearly 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded. After five days of intensifying smog, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. However, citizens did complain about the inconvenience so exceptions were made for hybrids and plug-in cars. The smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban.

Barack Obama's goals to curb the United Sates' greenhouse gas emission unveiled last week and will make a shift in American behavior. Recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses. Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Limiting car usage has many advantages.

We are witnessing a long-term cultural shift. Every year few and fewer citizens are geting their licenses and few cars are being bought (paragraph 29, The End Of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal). It is now more common that many cannot afford a car because the prices are going up and you have to invest in it, plus car-pool is very popular.

87E7F13BEB26,"In todays world we have trains, city buses, charter buses, bicycles, and ferry boats.  With all of these available transportation services there is no need to own or use a personal car.  Without personal cars you would be saving money, saving our ecosystem, and decreasing traffic congestion.

To begin, by limiting the usage of personal cars you are allowing yourself to save a tramendous amount of money.  With most average cars you fill the gas on it almost twice a week Which could cost upwards to 100 dollars a week. That is just about 50,000 dollars a year just on gas!  You also have to worry about servicing your car every once and a while, which you also pay for.  This isn't even including the down payments you put on the car or monthly payments.  When most cities offer a bus pass for about twenty-five dollars a month top ride it as much as you want within the time that it is valid.  For these reasons alone there is just no benefits to owning or using a personal car.

By eliminating the usage of personal cars you will be saving our ecosystem.  According to source 1 ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""  In certain parts of the United States gas emissions from personal cars make up half of all the polution going into the green house effect.  If you just take a city bus or train you are not only saving the worlds atmosphere but you are also saving you pockets.

Finally, if you are someone that gets up and early and drives to work and hits morning rush hour that is because you all have somewhere to be.  So instead of having one person in each car why not save time and reduce traffic by taking a bus that holds upwardas to thirty people.  Also with less cars on the road the less chances you have to getting in an accident.  By reducing personal car usage you will be getting to work on time and saving yourself from potential harm.

To conclude, without the usage of personal cars you will be saving money, the ecosystem, and reducing traffic congestion.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
793DE5EFEB37,"Have you ever thought about what the world would be without cars? You're probably telling yourself how would I get from my house to the stores. Maybe you should try walking because cars tend to cause damage to our environment. We the people should try limiting driving because if we do we won't have pollution,we wouldn't have to deal with smog,and even better protect our environment. Greenhouse gas has reduced since automobiles were limited in the suburbs.

Limiting cars could have a great impact on reducing air pollution. Countries such as China are known as one of the most polluted countries due to th amount of gas it uses. A businessman Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""this identifies that people actually care about pollution. Pollution can also be bad for us humans because not only does it affect our breathing but it can also led to death due to the types of chemicals that we take in. Paris is a city who has dealt with smog and took care of the situation really quickly.

Smog is a major factor why people all around the world are either limiting driving or even banning cars with in the region. An example of that would be Paris who had were near a record day setting of pure smog. The effect of this led Paris to enforce a partial driving ban to clear air of the global city. Motorist were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer the consequences by getting fined 22-euros. This difference led to a congestion which went down to about 60 percent in the capital of France. Animals have suffered the most since cars started to evolve or became more useful.

The environment in which we live in has suffered consequences as well. Organizations such as the Environmental Protection Agency are stepping in to help out within the community. They started to propmote car reducing due to the 80 percent of approprations by law have gone to highways and the rest towards other transportations.

Now you see why we should start walking instead of driving because its good for our health but the main reason is that it limits driving. It also reuces pollution as well as smog, and keeps the environment clean. Are you willing to sacrifice your driving addiction for the sake of human kind and our animals.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Cars have connected people all over the world, allowing them to reach loved ones, and friends and family easier then ever. Although with every good thing comes some bad. Cars run on gas, and when  they use the gas they cause pollution, that is slowly destroying the earth, second driving a car can encourage people not to walk and exercise since they can just push a pedal and go as fast as they need for as long as they need, finally running a car costs lots of money. Having to fix up the car and pay for gas to run the car, people without cars would have lots more money to spend on other nessesities like food and water.

531C5AD9451A,"Cars; most are used by workers, mothers, and pretty much all people in any urban area, they get us from point A to point B. But, as much as we use automobiles do we really  need them? They produce smog, indanger our chiildren and folk, and make life more stressing for us all. This can be fixed though, many places around the world have stoped using cars and even went to the length of banning them! Most importantly though they have opened our eyes to the atmoshpereic destruction that is caused by cars and ways we can do without them.

In Paris, a few days after near-record pollution, France banned driving for a couple days to clear the air or drivers will be fined up to 22 euros, or 31 dollars in America. ""Congestion was down  60% in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying in smog that rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" says Robert Duffer, a journalist for Paris (Robert Duffer, par. 14). This amazing number just shows how even reducing the use of cars cut back the smog by over half! Imagine what our air could be like if we didn't  use cars, it would help the ill and our children could breathe easily. And surprizingly enough, there are places already that do this act of banning cars and enforce it.

In Vauban, Germany-- there is a community of people who live in this fashion. Street parking, garages, and even driveways at homes are banned from this quaint suburban area. And, if you do own a car you have to pay almost $40,000 to park it, needless to say over 70% of families of the area don't own a car and 57% sold theirs to move to the area. A mother of two and resident of the area, Heidrun Wlater, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 3). And true to their word these kinds of urban areas have become popular in Europe and even in New York.

Car free areas have not been limited to just Europe though; in America, with its large areas of urban annd suburban ideals, is now changing the way the way we think about cars. In April 2013, the miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995 (32). Although small, this cultural change in the way we are using cars is significant. Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute says, ""What most intrigues me is that the rates of car ownershipper household and pe person started to come down 2 or 3 years before the downturn, I think that means something more fundamental is going on,"" (Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 33). The fact that America is changing the way we use cars is just another indicator that we should stop all together and join this car-free revolution.

To wrap it up, cars are hurting the air and they need to be cut back before we burn a hole through our atmoshpere. We're not alone in this car-free quest, many areas Europe and nothern America have started to implement this way of thinking. And lastly, this ideal is most needed in America's packed cities, the hazzard of smog and other pollution is hurt our citizens and needs to be stoped before it has long-term effect on our children.

A90655A28373,"Limiting car usage is one of the best things people can do in their everyday lives. Do something different for once! Life shouldn't be a dragging repeating cycle every day. Leaving your car at home and riding public transportation, or carpooling with friends, or walking, or biking; the options are endless! There are a ton of excellent and viable options that also happen to help reduce carbon emissions and let you feel good about yourself by helping the environment. Just some reasons are happiness, excercise, and reducing carbon emissions.

It's not everyday I get to ride in a car with my friends to school. Just imagine, if every four people drove to school everyday instead of driving by themselves, think of all the emissions that would stop. Heck, even riding the school bus lowers carbon emissions. This is all reality. If cities slowly started removing cars and making shops and food more within easy transportation distance, It would definitely make a difference on the looming threat of the ozone layer holes and carbon pollution. Even having one-day events, such as Bogota, Colombia's Car Free Day as seen in Source 3, would let people realize how big this is and the difference it would make to everyday life (in a good way)

Happiness is something people that live in modern United States may experience scarcely, or not as often as they think. Present life consists of a huge amount of stress to humans. Having a car may seem like it facilitates life at first, but it just becomes a burden that most people feel forced to carry. Putting things in the trunk and later forgetting them, paying for expensive gasoline, driving back and forth to places, how tiring it is to drive for long times, and the biggest car polluters, traffic congestion, are just some of the reasons why I definitely don't look forward to getting a car in my future, if I ever do.

06E1A0DC956F,"Everyone nowadays is so used to driving a car here and there even if it would just be five minutes on foot, but what if you started limiting your car usuage? Making your feet be your gas instead of a pump when the distance is close enough, and even biking occasionally. Limiting car usuage may sound like a bad thing, but it has many advangtages such as reducing pollutin, increasing saftety for human beings, and even opeing options for alternative transportion.

Cars release a great amount of polluants into the air increasing smog in some areas worse than others, like in Paris, China, and other places. Providing or opening your mind to other ways to get from one destination to the next, would reduce the smog thats in the air. This simple action as close to 70% of the population pitching in can result in a healthier environment, and some people may agree with Heidurn Walter. She says ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way."" Not only that, people who do not agree or get rid of their transportion vechicles will be fined. For example, in Germany you have to pay $40,000 if you want to get a car owner space and this does not include the money you have to spend on your house. Than, in Paris 4,000 drivers were fined $31 dollars after not leaving their cars home after a public annocement was made to do so. This shows that opening this can increase health, or make an environment cleanier. Plus, you actually inforcing something that is good for the environment will get people to participate, such as a fine.

Hearing engines roar and cars zoom pace is a sound all too familar with citizens who walk or ride constantly. It can be quite on the thrilling side crossing the streets or even walking down a busy rode when you know being hit is a possibly. Limiting car usage can decrease the risks or heavy weighted vechicles hitting biking, or walking citizens that dont have a chance against the weight. This increases saftety, bumping into another human or being nugded by a bike wont affect your body as much as a 500 pound or even heavier car crashing into a 100 pound person. Like, Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportuinity to take away stress..."" meaning the stess that comes with a car. The money for gas and the risk or hitting someone or being hit is taken away when on foot or on bike. This shows limting car usage isnt only increasing the safety or people walking or biking, it also takes away stess factors like money, fixing a car if it needs repair, and other factors.

Finally, having alternate forms of transportion can open your eyes to a whole need world. Instead of constanly beiong locked in your 4 door honda prison or your house you're outside seeing new people and increasing social interaction. Not only this, but you're getting excerise and maintaining your health or builing it. Which is another reason to limit the amount we use our cars. This shows that doing so can not only increase saftery, and money, but health and social oppurtunitys.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advangtages even if you dont realize it and our soiciety could benefit a lot from it. Like, when it comes to the safety of the next generation, the present, or the previous. Than, it can even take away stress that come with a vechicle and even increase health and social gathering.

Elisabeth Rosenthal said that cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. People could make towns smaller to help with limiting car usage. The world is also becoming more conntected with the new delevpoment of techology that cars are starting to feel obsulte.

Cars are very destructive to the enivorment they produce lots of greenhouse gases and create smog. in pairs alone there are about 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London said Robert Duffer. Duffer also said cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. So to help all these casue go down people are trying to create samller communities like in Vauban, Germany.

Vauban, Germany is a test suburb where people have to give up there casr to live in the small community.

F18D8AE261F0,"When limiting car usage the first thing that most everyone thinks of is: ""How would I get from Point A to Point B instead of driving myself in my car? Would I walk, ride a bike, take public transportation, or try and find a new creative approach?"" Limiting car usage is not the end of the world, it is the beginning of a healthy one. Most cars burn gas which cause smog and pollution which is harmful to the enviorment, some people get lazy and end up being so dependent on a vehicle that they will not even consider walking a few blocks to a friend's house for an afternoon lunch, and our own ancestors have gone without a car for centuries on end. So would it really be that much of a struggle to not use a car any and every where that you go? You do not need to never use your car again, you just need to realize that using your vehicle more than needed is harming not just yourself, but everything and everyone you interact with in life.

In Paris, France a partial driving ban was put into effect just before the 'City of Love and Romance' reached record breaking pollution levels. The ban states that: ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following days.""(""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer). However, just because there is a law put into affect does not mean that everyone will abide by it. According to Reuters, an international news agency in London, almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their vehicles impounded because of their reaction to the fines. It is a shame that people are so unwilling to follow one rule for one day which would help the planet and reduce the pollution in their city. According to Duffer, Paris ,typically, has more smog than other European capitals. When Duffer's article was published he states, ""Last week Paris has 147 micrograms of particulate matter(PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" Also, in Paris, diesel fuel is used more than gasoline. Diesel engines take more energy to burn the gas which causes more pollution than just normal gasoline. According to Reuters, France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. In France, as a whole, 67 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. In the rest of Western Europe, about 53 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. The smog that is in the air from the burning gas of your vehicle ends up in your lungs. Imgine just sitting in front of the exhaust pipe of your car for a few seconds(do not actually attempt this analogy) it is overwhelming and unbearable. It is harmful to your lungs and the rest of your body. That pollution is coming out of thousands and thousands of other cars and is adding up to the air all around you. You breath that air every day, just like your family and friends as well. In Paris, after the partial driving ban, on Monday the smog cleared up enough for the French party to take away the ban on the odd-numbered plates on Tuesday, according to Duffer. If the smog in one of the biggest cities in the world can clear up just a little bit in one day from limiting car usage, imagine how much smog could be prevented if you limit your car usage every day. What if you only used your vehicle when traveling out of town or when you need to transport a large item? You can change your whole enviorment just by deciding to walk or ride the bus to work instead of turning on your vehicle to drive 10 miles down the road.

The law that was put affect in Paris, France does not state that you can never drive your vehicle again, it is just simply asking the citizens to go one day without their vehicle. ""But what if I have to go somewhere such as work, school, or anywhere else that I want?"" Paris is a large city, that much is understood, because it is a large city there is more than just one way of getting from Point A to Point B. One way is public transportation from the city and/or local businesses, like a bus or tram.  According to the BBC public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday as well. So, if you did not want to spend extra money than you had to that would not be a probolem. If you do not like public transportation, or do not prefer it, you can get out for a bit of exercise and ride a bike or even walk. Getting up or leaving maybe an hour or two early so that you can get to your desired destination on time is not that heavy of a price to pay. Also, you are getting exercise out of it which benefits your health. Walking or even riding a bike to work can benefit you in so many ways. If you see someone familiar walking towards you, you have the opportunity to start up a conversation and catch up with how their life is going. As well as this, if you see a small shop or stand that sparks your interest you have easier access to explore inside. If you were driving/riding in a vehicle then you would have to cross traffic, find a parking spot, make sure you grabbed everything that you need, and make sure that it is locked. If you are taking a stroll through town, you already have your needed things, you do not need to cross traffic and find a parking spot, and you do not have to risk accidentally leaving your vehicle unlocked and end up possibly getting robbed. A study discovered by Elisabeth Rosenthal found out that driving by youth decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Maybe this is because young people still have the energy and sense of adventure in them to walk or take a bus somewhere(or they just can not afford it, which in the long run saves them money anyway). Maybe you can learn from the young people that decide to ride a bike or skateboard to work instead of driving a car. Maybe taking public transportation is not as crowded and as much of a hassle as the movies make it seem. Taking public transportation can introduce you to new people with different backgrounds as well. You can meet someone that you might not see as a coworker or a family friend that you have an idea already who they are. Some people are always so busy with every day life that they do not have the time to meet new people and learn new names. With public transportation or deciding to walk instead you have a bigger opportunity to meet someone new. Why not give yourself a healthier lifestyle by walking once a week to work instead of driving? The question still remains, why not?

Limiting your vehicle usage does not limit your options and exposure to the outside world. Having a vehicle is not entirely a bad thing either. Some vehicles are 'eco friendly' and are built so they can help protect the enviorment. Sadly, however, most are not built and designed that way. Driving is so stressful for a person. You have to focus on all of your surroundings, check every blind spot, make sure that all of your fluids are not empty, replacing tires, and so much more. Again, driving is not all bad. Some people enjoy to drive, some say that is relaxes them and gives them time to think because driving is the only 'alone time' that they have. Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The human race has survived countless centuries without motor vehicles, why can we not seem to last just a day?    ",6,Car-free cities,Text dependent

When you hear the word Smug what are your first reactions? It is this nasty poluted air that has trapped car emissions leaving a blaket of greyish air this is caused by ""cold nights and warm days. It is not good at all. when this happened in paris they banned cars from driving on certian days. ""If you have a lisense plate with an even number then you are not aloud to drive on mondays, Or if it is odd numbers then you are not aloud to drive on tuesday"". Until the smug has gone away.

In Bogota, Colombia a peogram that has been going around made its deput there for the first time. The program bans all use of cars excludeing taxis and buses, "" millions of columbians could have been saw walking or biking or hiking all around columbia"". They  also got to other cities to join in and participate in this event.

In the past few years in america the car driving avrage driving rate has droppped back to the rate it was in 1995 this is a complete shocker they believe we have hit the peak of driveing and it is dweendling very rapidally. Tis they believe was because of the recession and that people are just not as intrested in getting there lisense like they once where. ""the number of miles driven in the united staes peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily there after""

63E9761EB71E,"Everyone has at less had one car in there life time no matter how yes it was or how old or ragidy it was it was a car that was poluting our air and giving off greenhouse gas. Now I would now what i whould do with out my car but then again there are some berifits or advantages you would have if you didnt own a car.

We  can start off on now much money you would save if you did have a car. Think about gas is about what $2.99 now right? Or lets just say your driving minding your own bessnious and some edeit rams in the back of your new Nisson 2015 car and oh lord i dont think you want to talk about how high you insurents would go up. People in Vaudan and in most of France don't even have cars 70 percent to be exact. Now its not like a law that they can't have veicals just alot of people choose not to have one. How ever if you do own a car you will have pertty much no where to put it. Street parking,driveways and home garages are actally forbidden in some areas. If you still really really want your car you have only two places to put it. One in a large parking garage at the edge of the development or two you can buy a space for $40,000 along with a home. If you never had a car you wouldn't have to spend all that money on gas,insurents,getting your car repaired/fixed,and a parking spot. That's why 57 percent of people sold there car when they moved to Vauba.

The biggest advantage you would have if you didnt own a car is that you will be giving back to mother earth. Cars are responsible for 12 perect of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. Cars can also be more stress then there worth having. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. What do you think scards you the most when your dive? Getting in a car crash and seriousaly injuring yourself or worse die on inpacked right? Why don't you save the stress and the fear. Just give up you car. I know what your think what if i work far away etc? Just take the bus or better yet ride a bike to where ever you need to go or walk get some exercise and brake a little sweat. Or just take one day that we all not us own cars to just see how life would be. That's how BOGOTA got started in Colombia. They have been going it for 3 straight years. There are 7 million cizins people walked,hiked,and even skated. The only vehicals that where permitted where buses and taxis and if it rained it didn't stop them participating. Why can't we do that just for one day? If everyone just took one day that using cars I think i would make a big change.

There are many advantages we all would have if we all didn't have a car but I know it will take time for all of us to make that disitoin but hopful its soom before its to late for us and for the world.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

9731261F3B40,"Cars are a major deal now of days because we are dependent on getting somewhere with a car. Little do you know that it damages and hurts our environment. Limiting or even getting rid of cars would be the smartest thing we will ever do. It would not only help us now but it will help the generations after us.

Have you ever wondered what would happen if we limit vehicle usage and only used tranzits and taxis? What would happen would be miraculous. The greenhouse effect would stop, smog would be no more, and pollution would be cut to a minimum. It can be done we just have to set our mind to do it like a the few cities and countries have been doing.

If the world only used tranzits or taxis to get to places the differences would be endless. Traffic would go down and the transportation your taking wouldn't even take long to get to your destination. It would also save you money instead of $20 every day for gas you would spend $2-$3 a day. Life would be easier and safer if cars were limited.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
493B30EF3E6C,"Most people either own a car themselves or know someone who owns one either way most people own a car. The fact is though that the advantages of limiting car usages adds up to about a billion but today im here to present just a couple to you.

As Ms. Walter says in the article ""'I'm much happier this way'"" (3) and see she owned a car and she always felt tense but now without a car she can hear the sound of bicycles and ""'...chatter of wandering children'""(3). Many people just like her either own cars because they don't know how to live without them or they don't own cars and they are less tense and can hear the wonderful sounds of mother nature. Just think about it; how often do you hear birds chirpping or kids playing at parks or even leaves rustling? if you were honest you would say almost never because its true all of the motorized vehicles that we have in this world drown all of the best sounds out. We simply don't hear them anymore; no instead we hear a train running by at tweleve in the morning or the screech of tires at six in the morning on the way to school or even worse we hear tons and tons of car horns going off all at once just because someone isn't moving at a red light. Seriously do we even know how horrible all of that is and guess what its all because the human population wants to be able to get places faster.

Most people are noticing this now but in the past no on noticed that our own way of trassportation was and is polluting the world. In Europe 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emmisions are caused by passenger cars. Also ""...up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States""(5) are greenhouse polluted because of the cars. The human race can stop this ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway""(6). See thats the thing we can change this and we can survive with out cars. There is no disadvantage of limiting car use because we can live without them. Infact there are only advantages; we can stop polluting the earth, we can have a safer world, and we can finally hear mother nature and concentrate on something better in our lives. The thing is that we dont even have to go without cars because we have created electrical cars that are rechargable; yes they are very expensive but if we just used those then they would be alot cheaper. By having a car we are polluting the earth and by not having one we aren't; not polluting the earth is a advantage of limiting car usage.

The fact is that the advantages of limiting car usage out weigh the disadvantages of limiting car usage which is why having a car can help or hinder us; just depends on you look at it.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
683BE7836E6C,"Cars have been by all means the number one way of  transportation in the last decade and now people are starting to prefer walking or biking instead of driving everywhere. One of the reasons is pollution people all around the world are scared of the greenhouse effect but peole are moslty looking at the advantages in not driving If we dont drive the earth will be less polluted in the united states the number two cause in pollution is cars if we cut our driving in half we would be making our earth less polluted and more clean and also saving our ozone layer another reason that not driving isnt such a nad thing is you dont have to deal with the gas money everyone spends on there car well if you want to drive you have to put gas in it so it can go and sometimes the gas prices can be up there an if i gave my estimate i think people spend close 20,000 dollars in gas if your driving in your community of course im not talking about every person in the world just giving an estimate and that is alot of money if you save that much money in about 4 years you have your self a house or an apratment its a big difference spending all that money on gas then saving up for something you really want like a house apartment etc something else you dont have to deal with is the traffic that cars cause on the higway and sometimes in the community i know we all have been stuck in a horrible traffic jam and you cant do anything about it and we all think if only we could just walk ny everybody well the people that arnet driving and they are on the sidewalk yeah they can walk past it or they dont have to deal with the traffic jam another reason is a the accidents sometimes can be fatal to life and your checkbook and insurance now a days is through the roof another thing you have to worry about paying when your dealing with a car accidents take alot of lives every year i read a stat that every second there are  three acidents i mean i dont know if its true but if it is that is flat out scary of course you never think it will happen to you but even the best drivers crash and when it does happen either your life is in danger or checkbook is thats another thing walkers and bikers dont have to worry about crashing and either being seriously injured or coughing thousnads of dollars of expensies or damages also have to worry about keeping your car in the shop every time you need an oil change or your tires are flat or transmisson isnt working right there can be a millon problems with your car and that all cost money waling to your destantion doesnt cost a cent and if your the person that likes to save every cent why throw it away when you throwing thousands and thousands of dollars every year on something youn quite francally dont need in your life if your destnation is to walk take the bus close enough so you can walk there that way you will be saving so much money that you'l be amazed at the end of the year when you have way  more money than you had last year your going to look back and say wow i should never got a car so always keep in mind the next time you step  in your car the worries you deal with every time you drive remember ypu have to fill up or your not going any where and always going to hurt your checkbook espiacally if your car gets 10 per a gallon another thing is  the scare of the accident always looming in the dark you never know when you'll have but almost everyone is doomed to have one and those can be fatal to your body or checkbook and insureance for when it does happen is not pretty also those traffic jams are horrible and when you say aabout 50 peole all past you on the side walk and your stuck in that massive traffic jam you'll remeber this essay and say wow i should of been on that side walk and the last advantge you should know about is that while your not driving your not hurting everyones earth world air space etc your helping the earth get cleaner everytime you decide to walk instead pump up your gas tank and let off polluted gas off into the air and ulitamelty deplete the ozone i know that people will still be driving because again like i said its the number one way of transportation but the goal should be to atleast cut the driving rate in half that would help the earth in a major way and of course you would be alot richer by the end of the year so all that walking you did over the year you can rechoice over a nice vaction to the bahmamas or hawaii oe even buy yourself a nice house so you can see that dropping your car should of been a decison you did years ago and the earth will be a better place without your car driving around the streets so the next time your friend asks to come over just walk or the next time you need to just go get the groroices you can walk and one by one peole will stop driving and start helping making the earth a better cleaner safer place so you be the first one to drop driving and start walking and people will follow imsure of it and even if you have to explain the benfits so beit just know by doing those things you will acheive the goal of making the earth a better place without pollution and more ozone layer to protect from the dangerous uv light if you want a better future for your kid or grandchild its just not your earth your hurting its everybody else's including your loved ones all that money your spending buy your

129785BD3076,"""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walker, in ""car-free cities"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal. Currently in the United States, 82 percent of people own a vehicle. Which means in the average city is a busy street, car horns honking, triffic conjested place to live. Limiting car usage can be beneficial to you, your city, and your planet.

Limiting car usage can have great advantages on the Earth. Almost half of the greenhouse gas in the united states is from cars. Greenhouse gas has an effect on the North and South Poles that makes them melt faster causeing the sea level to rise. So, if we were to lessen the use of cars we would be doing a great favor to the Earth. Many times on the news we hear about oil spills, and big or small, it hurts so many sea animals because it gets in their fur and when prey wants to eat those contaminated animals they die. Think of all the innocent animals that get hurt so that cars have gas to run on.

Living in a car-free city can benefit the whole community. Knowing all or your neighbors is pretty rare now because everyone is always on the go driving somewhere, or cooped up in their home. Walking or Biking to the store with your neighbors can be the new normal if car usage was limited. Vehicles will actually hurt your health in the long run, because cars put so much pollution in the air which will eventually make the air too toxic to breathe. In, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Pobert Duffer, ""just one day with half of paris not driving the smog cleared enough that they didnt have to ban driving the next day"". According to the U.S. motor vehicle accident website, every ten minutes somebody dies in the United States due to a car accident. Loved ones can be saved if car usage is limited.

Reducing the usage of cars will benefit your well being. Driving a vehicle requires so much attention and focus, it is quite stressful. ""It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo during Bogota, Colombia's car-free day. People of Vauban, Germany (a city that gave up cars) are happier, they have more energy, and they even look younger. Gas is at an everage price of two dollars and thirty cents, think of all the money that can be saved and put towards something else if you never had to pay for gas again! Limiting car usage will help you financially, physically, and mentally.

Overall, a city without cars has many advantages. People can see the people they love and the planet they love prosper without the usage of vehicles. According to, ""The end of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which, 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.'""                        ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

The crescendo of the birds serenading eachother with their dainty chirps. Inhaling fresh, sweet air. And not even the slightest echo of a car's vroom in the distance. VAUBAN, Germany, BOGOTA, Colombia, and even the global city Paris, are living the average american's greatest fear to clear up the atmosphere by limiting car usage. At least one day, without the convience of a vehicle to take you along your marry way.

Paris had a near-record pollution, and just days after the incident, the city enforced a partial driving ban to clear the city's air. Any motorist driving a vehicle with a license plate that contained the print of an even number, faced a 22-euro fine. Same punishment went for a motorist caught driving with an odd-numbered plate the following day. After just five days of the city's recovery from harsh smog, congestion went down 60 percent in the capital. Just goes to show that the slightest bit of effort can make quite a global impact. If only it could become a trend. Which brings me to introduce you to a prime example a trend that is currently growing in Europe.

Vauban, Germany, home to 5,500 residents, is an upscale community thriving with suburban pioneers, is a prime example of the type of community trying to make a difference, that is now trending. Where residents must pay a whopping fee of $40,000 for one space, in a large garage, at the edge of the only known car ownership. Forbidden street parking, driveways, and home garages is what makes that bill ever so large. Not a car is to be thought of while walking through the streets fresh air bombarded with bicyclists and walkers.

But what about the country who has a love affair with it's vehicles, The United States? Well, according to an analysis by Doug Shortof Advisor Perspectives, As of April 2013, the number of miles driven driven by Americans was at it's peak in 2005, and has durastically dropped thereafter. Transportation for America is a fast growing coalition of people in the US who are promoting, and supporting the communities that are less dependent on cars. David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, stated that ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change. How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.""

Transportation for America isn't the only agency standing to make a difference, either. The Enviromental Protection Agency promotes communities with reduced car usage, and it's about time that legislators are cautiously starting to act upon this main contributor to the problems of pollution. At this rate, if the pattern persists, Sociologists have determined that all of this will have beneficial implications on the enviroment.

Vauban's streets are ""car-free"" - except the main thorughfare, where the tram to downtown Freibug runs, and a few streets on the edge of the community. America has been making some changes to the modern day car suck as hybrid and energy efficent. ""All of the development since WWII has been centered on the car, and that will havet o change"" said David Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg also added "" How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.

Paris has had some pollution problems, because of this tey enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. People that owned cars would be on a rotation. Even number license plates would drive on day and not the next, same when for the odd number plates. It took almost 5 days to life the smog. A good reason why are not so good to the envoirment no matter how we change them. Did you know Beijing, China is one of the most polluted cities in the world.

Heres a great story writen by Andrew Selsky. Bogota, Columbia- In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hikes, biked, skates, or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. That was the third striaght year that Columbia had a car-free day. So many citys are starting to have a car-free day just to cut back on pollution, i think that is amazing, i wonder of we can get Florida to do somwthing like this one day.

The End of Car Culture. Studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses each year. Transportation is the second largest source of American's emissions, just behind the power plant. New York has a new bike sharing program that has skyrocketed in the last few months.

There are just little things we can do to helo the enviorment, like not driving a car for a day or buy a new hybrid to cut down pollution, Or maybe you have an idea small things can change our world for the better.

I love walking, i can get excercise and have fun because im with my friends. car riding can be exttremely dangerous too.

First of all, driving a car could be very dangerous. For example, some people like to drive while texting which could result in a serious accindent. Another reason is not paying attention to the other drivers near you. Kids should not be behind the wheel of a car yet. I say that because they do not take as serious as aldults. Teens also like to drive fast to show off or have loud music blasting, these are also advantages of limiting car usage. Car accindents would derease dramatically.

Second of all, cars take up too much gas which takes up a lot of our money, Walking would be super cheap because you do not have to pay to walk. Driving around 24/7 makes us really lazy. Walking to where we need to go gives us excercise, and quite frankly everyone needs some excercise or a little work out. The goverment will even make more pathways or trails for us to travel on. I understand if you are leaving town for a family vacation or going somewhere that is not walking distance, the city has various types of motor transportation, like city buses, cabs, bikes, and do not forget about our planes.

Third of all, im not saying completely get rid of cars just limit how much you drive. Instead of buying car after car after car carpool with friends. That way you can still get to where you gotta go quickly and lower emissions. People do not drive as much as they used to, i found out by a study that driving decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Lets try to make that 50 percent. People do not really care about a car, they just want a quick way to get from A to B. All we gotta do is Find a safer more cheaper way for them to do that and the percentage will drop rapidly.

In Conclusion, limiting car usage can be improved by getting people to walk more. Carpool with friends, ride bikes, takes buses, cabs, even planes to where they have to go. This will help our enviorment to be  much safer and healthier.

84A3F94111A8,"There are many advantages to limiting car useage throughout the world. Also there are many different countries all over the world, who have passed laws to prevent the useage of cars to help preserve the ecosystem. Others have passed laws to simply help the economy from harm such as smog or acid rain.

First off, cars are bad to begin with, cars exhaust lets off posionous toxins into the air. These toxins, which is posionous for human consumption, can leave many negative affects to the human body. Limiting car use can prevent lots of things like this. Limiting your car use can actually be a healthy thing for you and the ecosystem.

0783B9F37695,"Cars have been a great way of transportation that has been around since the early days. It's a fast and simple way of getting to where you need to be at the right time. However, there are many downsides to cars, also, especially when it deals with environmental circumstances. Therefore, car use should be limited due the fact that limitng car use will reduce greenhosue gasses, conserve resources we need in order to live that is nonrenewable, and allows for communities to be more connected by preserving the environment.

To begin with, car usage is becoming a major issue for the world today due to pollution. Greenhouse gasses are being leaked into the atmosphere each day to cars' transmission fuels. According to Source 1, it states, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" These gasses damage ecosystems, and leave many environments unstable due to its destruction. It can also effect human beings, also. According to Source 2, the passage says, ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" This pollution that is occuring around the world can damage our health if not taken care of. By limiting car usage, it would not only benefit the environment, but our health also.

Preceding on, along with the benefits of the envionment and our health, limiting car usage will also save help save many resources we use in cars that is nonrenewable resources. Nonrenewable resources are resources that can not be replaced when it is used up. These resources are resources that are important to our every day lives, as we've gotten used to having these resources and would suffer without them. According to Source 2, it states, ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has... [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compares to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters."" Diesel is an important nonrenewable resouce that we need that is causing pollution and smog in many places. By limiting the car usage, it would conserve these resources.

Futhermore, limiting car usage would also help bring many communities together. If a whole community got together and decided to limit car usage with the whole community involved, it would give a sense of unity and benefit the community, also. An example of this was the residents of Vauban, Germany. In Source 1, the passage states ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. 'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" Due to the limiting of driving cars, many people actually felt more of a sens of relief rather than with cars. In Source 3, it says, "" Bogota, Colombia -In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoif of traffic jams. It was the third straight yeat cars have been permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" This community was able to come together as a whole in order to reach the goal of reducing smog and allowing for an alternative transportation method. By limiting car usage, communities are able to act more of a community rather than individuals.

All in all, limiting car usage would be beneficial to the world. The advantages of limiting car usage would be the reduction of greenhouse gasses and smog, the conservation of nonrenewable resources used in cars, and making communities stronger by coming together to stop the driving of cars. Cars are a big and major part of the world today, but it can be more beneficial to limit it rather than continue it.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

People should engage in limiting their car usage becuase it betters personal health, improves the enivronment, and leads to economic prosperity while still gaining all the benefits that come from using a car.

When the usage of cars is limited it often leads to better health benefits. This is true becuase when people are restricted on their driving it forces them to resort to healthier, more proactive altertnatives. For example, instead of driving somewhere people are now having to get out and walk or ride a bike. This leads to regular exercise without having to think about it and decreases overall stress levels. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" Heidrum Walter, a media trainer and mother of two explained, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way"". Heidrum, a citizen of the Vauban community in which everyone has given up their cars, describes how the non-usage of cars has bettered her life and in turn has actually made her a happier person. In addition, when a high usage of cars is present it creates brutual smog that can perpetuate health issues. In the aricle ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Robert Duffer states how congestion lead to smog in Beijing in which he states ""Beijing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". The impact of this is that when people are more active and choose not to exasterbate their driving usage, it will lead to global decreases in smog and in fat related illnesses such as obesity, high blood plessure, diabetes, and other various things that have plagued the nation and taken the lives of so many people.

Limiting Motor Vehicles usage reduces the amount of carbon emissions and pollution in the air. Cars exert so much greenhouse gas emissions that degrades the air in the environment. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars"" Elisabeth Rosenthal gives the analogy that, ""...an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middles class are choking cities"". Elisabeth Rosenthal further quantifies the extent to which cars have increasing become the culprit of pollution, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". The impact of this is that when cars are used less often it betters the environment which is what mankind relies on for survival.

An increase in a healthy workforce and better environmental communities leads to greater economic prosperity. When people choose to drive less it often creates a riple effect. This is true because a healthier workforce is present it leads to more productivity. In addition, a more prosperous environment and less pollution exerted decreases operational costs. As a result Andrew Selsky in his article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" explains the various economic effects that less car usage has made, ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city.....and new restaurants and upscale shopping distrcits have cropped up"". The impact of this is that with more economic leverage communities are more equipped to invest and strengthen other areas such as education and job creation.

In conclusion, people should limit their driving and/or car usage because it provides three benefits. First, when people have to resort to proactive alternatives it improves their person health and decreases stress levels. Second, not using cars eliminates all the environmental harms that come from a car such as greenhouse gas emissions. And lastly, when people are more active and the enivronment is no longer depleted, communities experience greater economic longevity.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
46DBC71B9B37,"There is a new age coming,and with that means change. Most people dont like change but ths change is a good one. Its useing your car less and use other means of transportsion around your city or town. This leads to less smog around a major city and a safer inviorment for children.

To begin , changing  how we travel around the citys and towns of are country's is esental in this time of age. The world is changing how we think and do thing is changing. We are loseing some of are ignorence. The world we live on is running out of oil and that means no more gas powerd cars. To conserve the resorces we have we need to start takeing the bus to work or school. Or Rideing a skateboard to the shop down the street instead of wasting presious resourses that is going to dissaper in 20 to 30 years. And not useing your car is a go thing ,that means less stress on you mind a body. imagin not having to worry about a car payment and having that extra money tohave fun with you'r kids. Useing your car less also means less smog and cleanier air around. For exsample, in Pairs there was alot of smog so they put a ban on cars for two days and it cleared up the city. Now if started doing this more we would help are invierment so much.

Secound off, Not useing your car as much also creates a much safer enviorment for kids. And they can live a more helthy life. And thats what we want, we want to protect are kids a give them a child hood they can look back on. This means you can let your kid outside and not worring about a drunk driver comeing down the street and hitting your kid and killing them. We want the best futer for are grandchilderns children, and know we set them up for good. We need to start designing are towns and city's like Vauban ,Germany. It will make a better and cleaner world for us.

In conclution, we need to put down the car keys and pick up the bike , or hop on the bus. Because Time is running out. And we dont want it to be to late to change. This is the only thig we got . So lets do it right the firts time and not screw it up.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
1E9381C4D69A,"Imagine a world where there is no traffic or loud motor from cars passing by. Think of all the benefits that would come with less or even no cars on the road. Well in the city of VAUBAN, Germany they have almost completely knock out all the cars in the city. The city has car-free streets allowing more flow of commuters on bikes and walking. 70 percent of the families have no car with 57 percent that sold their car just to move there. Heidrun Walter feels much less tense now then when she owned a car. However some may ask ""How do you get all you produce or go shopping?"". Well VAUBAN is one step ahead because all the stores are within walking distance, rather then travling down highways crowded with daily commuters, and there are some public transport still make there way around town, such as the city's tram. One major problem with cars is the emmisions they let out. Now in cities like VAUBAN where there would be at most two cars on the same road, it's more of a minor porblem. But in cities like New York, where the streets are crowded with cars, it begins to cause many problems. The emmisons are known as greenhouse gas and can often choke a cities population. Now in a city like Paris how would people limit smog, and car emmisions. They chose to limit the cars, causing the separation of commuters driving days by license plate numbers being even or odd. They enforce this limit with a fine of 22 euro. Of course this took a little getting use to since it came so suddenly causing four thousand driver to be fined and 27  had their cars impounded simply becase they didn't like the fine. Now most people were probaly not to happy to be getting fined, however the statistic showed that the limit was working and traffic that was down 60 percent. However it wasn't completely the commuter fault, since france had a tax policy for gasoline many people prefered to use diesel which was about 67 percent of the vehicles. Even though most of the traffic was down by 60 percent, Paris still has more pm then most erupean capital such as Brussel's 114. In BOGOTA,Colombia they took the idea of a car free city with a different approach. Instead of outright, banning cars or placing limits on days certain people can dirve, they instead banned all cars for a day excluding buses and taxis. However instead of outrage by the public many of the colombians just walked, biked or took some form of public transport. Since the begining of the project in the mid 90s over 110 miles of bike paths have been cvonstructed within the city. Another benefit is the uprise in sports and park areas, restaurants and shopping districts, since people have more time to see things they like or want. Now most of this eassy is about orther cities in different contries, but what about us, the USA. Obama has revealed his plans to lower the greenhouse gas emissions. But it seems the people have already thought ahead as statistic show less cars licenses and driving  over the years. Some say it was due to to the recsession since many people were to poor to afford a car or just didnt need one since the didin't work. Mr. Sivak's reasearch has proved that getyting a car is no lopnger a proirity but instead something you get if you have moeny. He states. Mine 19 and 21 have not bother to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where it would come in handy."" Even statistic show the between 2001 and 2009 young driver population has dropped 23 percent. The cars we use today are slowly edging their way out of our daily lives, and with the help of some laws, limits or outright bans cars will soon become a thing of the past.

0813DC303DDA,"The advantages of limiting car usage are overwhelming. Even so much as a car-free day as Bogota Columbia has been doing for the past three years is majorly beneficial. Limiting car usage has been sweeping around the world. It is stated that ""passenger cars are responsible for almost 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the United States. This indicates that the continuous usage of all these automobiles needs to be acknowledged and limited.

Located in Vauban, Germany is a suburb where there are no cars and life goes on, according to Elisabeth Rosenthal. A resident of the suburb, Heindrun Walter, says,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This movement of separating suburban life from auto use is called ""smart planning"", and is a growing trend in the United States and Europe (Rosenthal 5). In the passage it clearly says that ""...as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles...chatter of wandering children drown our the occasional distant motor."" This fantasy like state is possible with the cutting of auto usage.

Paris, France had a partial driving ban enforced when they had days of near record pollution in the air. By doing so Robert Duffer writes,""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"". With this information the thought that the car gas emissions were obviously a huge component in the horrible pollution comes about. On the other hand in Bogota, Columbia they are and have been having a car-free day by choice. The turnout was large even with gray skies and showers. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" says Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Another person, Carlos Arturo Plaza, said,""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" while riding his bike with his wife. The city's parks and sport centers have been blooming along with the construction of sidewalks and new restuarants and shopping areas, writes author Andrew Selsky. This is important because it shows the beneficial and positive outcomes limited car using has. Not only is it neccessary for you but it is essential to the world and atmosphere around us.

Lastly, in the United States President Obama has been working hard to curb the greenhouse gas emissions. Many statistics have come down showing that America's love affair with its vehicles is cooling, according to Rosenthal. Sociologists have said that is this pattern presists the implications will be beneficial to the environment. Many young people now do not make driving one of their priorities. They organize to car-pool or take public transportation to get to where they need to go. The reality of it is if you can do something to help a major crisis in this world and give yourself an advantage they why not do it? Limiting car usage is more important than you think, and without doing so you can miss out on major opportunity, motivation, and forward moving.                                     ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
9661F6D99DFC,"There is a new trend going on in Europe. The people of Europe are creating a way of life to go back to when there were no cars. They have decided to live with out automobiles. In Germany a place called Vauban is a car free area. They have left the modern life to live as suburban pioneers. This is a experimental district out side of other towns to be completely car free. The advantages of reducing car usage is that they are reducing green house gasses, reduce smog, and to live happier.

First, in Vauban the communities are trying to reduce green house gasses drasticaly by exicuting car usage in that area. 70% of Vauban families are car free and 57% sold there cars to move there. It is important to them to reducethe amount of exoust from cars to reduce green house gasses.

Second, in Colombia the people are dealing with a major smog problem caused by the burning of fossile fuels. They have decide to band car usage for on day to take away stress and reduce air polution. Their goal was to create an alternitive trans portation system and to reduce smog. during car free day people walked, biked, skated, or took buses to their work all to be a part of a cleaner place.

lastly, these people who are being a part of cleaning their cities of smog and green house gasses all seem to be happier and have less stress. In Vauban people are saying that having no cars is stress free and they seem to live happier. Also in Colombia they are all happy to be a part of car free day to reduce smog.

477E5638E830,"The extensive use of car transportation is setting a cloud over our society, literally. Car transportation is so heavily depended on in the current generation that people don't realize the negatives it has on our environment, local buisnesses, and people's lives in general. Transporation is not a priority and there are numerous advantages to gain out of limiting the use of cars; the smog percentages in the atmosphere will decline and create an everlasting clear environment and magnificent clarity built skies, local buisnesses that are run by families in suburbs will see their popularity rising back up to their previous points before malls in distant areas took over, the stress of supporting a cars expenses will be relieved, and people will realize that we connect just as well through the internet rather than driving to meet friends.

Although cars are used by a vast amount of the population, the impact it has on the environment is without-a-doubt an ongoing situation that needs to be taken care of. The author states in the passage that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. That should automatically tell you that these vehicles are putting an impact on our environment. Limiting the permission that citizens have of using their cars temporarily has shown a massive decrease in the smog build up that takes up a rather large percentage in most cities, in source #2, paragraph 12 the author states the outcome of Paris permitting drivers with even-numbered licenses from driving; this saw smog levels clear up enough to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. If only temporarily holding people back from driving can affect our environment so positively, imagine what the output would be if the world repeated this action on a much larger scale.

Furthermore, cars promote the popularity of malls, which takes away the attention from numerous local buisnesses. These local stores are ran by families that need customers to keep their system alive, and if cars are traveling a further distance to reach malls, it just takes away the money needed by these local buisnesses. Living in small communities and suburbs is a great solution to this problem and has proven to work already, for instance; The suburb of Vauban, Germany stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant high way.

Another advantage of limititing car usage would be the lessening of stress, so many people have the burden of paying expensive car bills and having to work more than one job just to keep up with the numerous payments cars require, accidents are also caused by the massive amount of cars that are already in use on the roads. If people would carpool more often or take public transporations such as buses and trains, we would see an immense improvement of families income and we'd expect a safer society as a whole, safer from the hazards caused by the humongous majority of vehicle transportation. Having a car isn't a priority, working a job close to home and using bus transportation will be benfitial to your community, just plan out your approach and you'll soon understand why having a car isn't always necessary.

All in all, putting a stop to the extensive of cars will mainly bring out the pros, people always say they want to see the world become less polluted and free from toxic gases, limiting car usage is the first step to achieving this goal as we'd see smog in our skies clear out, your local buisnesses can step back into popularity and connect your community even more rather than traveling a far distance to reach malls. And finally, one of the main advantages would be the effect is has on you. All your money stresses will be relieved and you'll be able to focus on something more important than a car bill. The world is noticing these possibilities and we are heading for a chage on step at a time.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
79BFD0B9910D,"Cars are a very big part of our lives, we rely on the to get us from point A to point B. But what if we had no need for cars anymore? What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities aroud the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more enviormental issues are becomeing big problems due to the rutine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways.

When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramaticly cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the enviorment and the air aroud the city.

Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to acheive its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all useage of privte motor vheciles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramaticly. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportion vheicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now ""It's a good opportunity to tke away stress and lower air pollution"" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that goverments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars.

Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world. With all of the banifits of not continuisly driving the world would be such a better place. One day this dream for many will become the way we all learn to live.

264F35FDCEB4,"Ah, the great smell of pollution hitting your face as you walk out the door; the way the polluted air puts a haze over your eyes. There is nothing better than that when you begin to start your day every morning. Most people do not seem to enjoy the slap in your face you get when you just cannot seem to get enough air into your lungs. The use of cars has be steadily decreasing over the years, and public transportations are beginning to be used more, and more. Along with this, cities are even beginning to ban the usage of cars. This has become an idea that has spread globally and everyone is beginning to take an interest to have the pollution level lowered, and to make the air much cleaner.

It is time to inform you, that places around the world big, and small are beginning to ban the usage of cars. Cities as big as Paris, France have banned car usage to bring down the pollution levels found in their great cities. Vauban, Germany, a suburban community, has completely given up their cars, in which car owners must purchase a spot for their car in a garage that can cost up to forty-thousand dollars. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in,

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , seventy percent of Vauban's families do not even own cars, and fifty-seven percent of the people living there chose to sold their cars before they moved there. Vauban's ideas has been spread throughout the world and now other suburbs are beginning to want to make places denser and make everything a walking distance away. Cities as great as Paris, France enforced a partial ban on driving cars to clear the air of the city, which was said by Robert Duffer in,

Paris bans driving due to smog.

Paris had made it easier to get public transportation while the ban was being enforced by making public transportation free of charge Friday to Monday. With pollution levels higher than ever with the amount of factories and cars, in congested cities it is a good idea for car usuage to go down to allow the air to clear from pollution. Limiting the amount of car usuage will clear the air we breathe, and allow us to inhale deeper breaths.

In addition, there are many different forms of transportation that can be used instead of just the average car, you may use bikes, roller-skates, skateboards (longboards, and penny boards), or even just a simple walk to get to places. Attempting to minimize the usuage of everyone using a single car to get to a place a carpool, taxi, bus, train, or subway can be another means of transportation that may be used. This will limit the amount of traffic on the streets, and minimize the amount of pollution that is going into the air. Some will say that not driving to your destination yourself will take more time whether it be because you have to wait for your specific train to arrive, or waiting for the taxi to show up to your doorstep, you have to wait a few extra minutes to leave for your destination. In reality, that few extra minutes you have waiting for the taxi can be stopped you can do this by, calling the taxi a few minutes before you want to leave so that it will arrive precisely when you want it too. With the use of bikes, walking, or skating everywhere you go, you will also begin to get into better shape, as you are moving towards your destination. The usage of cars for only trips that will take hours will also help to save you money on gas, and your car millage.

Furthermore, by beginning to add neat sidewalks, parks, and everything in a walking distance people will be encouraged to walk more and will not have reason not to use their car. Elisabeth Rosenthal states in,

The End of Car Culture , that even in America the usage of car is beginning to dtop down steadily. The amount of young people getting their driver's license is starting to decrease and has gone down twenty-three percent between 2001 and 2009. She also state at the Mobile World Congress the proposed the idea that they should partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety."" With people beginning to take interest in other means of transportation cities, and towns alike will begin to make things a walking distance to meet the obscure demand from the people.

In conclusion, people around the world are beginning to take interest in lessening the usage of cars in their cities, and towns. Cars have began going down in sales and less people are buying them. Other means of transportation have come up that will begin to benefit us health wise. Making us healthier by excercising and clearing our air of toxins found in pollution. If cities around the world begin to decrease the amount of car usuage our air will become much clearier and satisfying to live in. It will make getting to destinations much safer with the less chance of accidents and injuries from motor vechicles. Reducing car usage will begin to change the world by making it a much cleaner, healthier place to live.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E45AE554215A,"If someone wishes to travel somewhere, such as a normal commute, proably the first transportation method they think of is a car. Cars are everywhere. They're the things hiding in a home, waiting for someone to enter the depths of the dark garage. Unless the grage is truly empty of the world-killing machiene, such as in Vauban, Germany where people have done the unthinkable: got rid off cars.

Though it may sound proposterous, or even critically insane to even concider giving up a car, the citizens of Vauban are a lot happier to be rid of the burden. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happpier this way"" (Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars). As you may have forgotten, car payments, maintnance, check up, oil changes, and gas are all part of owning a car which may be a financial strain for most.

Again, those robots that you move with pedals and a steering wheel are seriously affecting our Earth. We're Earth murderers. ""Passenger cars arw responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars).

""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clean the air of the global city"" (Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog). Less driving cars is less greenhouse gasses that destroy our Earth.

In our society today, cars are the dominant transportation method. When you go outside in today's world it is most likely not the sound of nature, but a manmade vehicle. Without cars, a whole new world will come forth, or most likely the beautiful world we forgot about that is mercilessly trapped beneath unessesary layers of greenhouse gases. When Paris banned cars, it improved the pollution stuck in the air. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French part to recind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"" (Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog). If we stop driving cars, it will help most people financially, help our Earth, and ease the worry and stress over the maintenance of a car. Once again, we are not the only species on Earth.

F10B5A59FE18,"There are many reasons why reducing the need for transportation by car would help solve many problems. Cars cause many major environmental issues. Cars also cause many health issues, seeing that they encourage motorized transportation, instead of the human body's own two-legged system of getting from point 'A' to poit 'B'. Many authors have wrote about cases where some places in the world are trying to see how becoming a car-free zone would help the economical, environmental, and health related issues caused by vehicles such as cars.

Elizabeth Rosenthal explains that a German experiment is already happening where the country have created a city where there are little to no vehicals driving down the roads without punnishment. In the passage I recently read, by Rosenthal, titled ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", she talks about how Vauban, Germany residents are playing the most important role in an experimental project that prohibits things like street parking, driveways, and home garages. The district has also moved nessecary places (grocery stores, etc.) a lot ""closer-to-home"" in order to make them be within walking distances of peoples' houses. This is done as a way to essentially eliminate the use of vehicles to get from place to place. One man, Heidrun Walter, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" He is one of many participants of this experiment who shows that terminating vehical use in countries will possibly make a lot of people happier and it will also cause the air around us to be nearly free of pollutes and toxins that we possibly inhale on a daily basis, as suggested in paragraph #5 of Rosenthal's passage.

Benefits from car bans are also discussed in Robert Duffer's passage called, ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"". Paragraph #10 of this passage states, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban..."", meaning that the amount of polluted air in the effected countries and cities went down to a controllable amount after the ban had taken place. Therefore, this passage is even more evidence that cars being eliminated from public use is a very good thing for the environment.

Eliminating, or at least cutting back on motorized transportation, would definately help a lot of damaged areas of the world.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
3C30F580ABAE,"France, Germany , United States, Colombia and other countries are taking actions of the problems that the cars are making. It is true that cars are helpful and make the life easier to some persons but lately the concer of how this machines affect the ecosystem have being increasing. That is  why countries have come with different projects to try to limit the amount of cars they are around their cities. If we see from a different perpestictive the limiting of cars can be a good thing and produce result that are favorable to everyone.

Through the years they have been several projects of reductiond of car circulation and it is visible that the population have apadted to the type of living that cities have imposed.

One example of this is Vauban, Germany were 70 percent of the families do not have a car and 57 percent sold a car to move there. with that example we can see that people can get used to a live where cars are not necesary to have. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I am uch happier this way,"" these are the word of one of the resident of that city that get used to a lifestyle without a car. In that city people get used to walk which is more healty and do not produce any harm to the ecosystem.

Other cities like Paris have made laws to control the amount of pollution cars produce since , this capital have more smog than other European capitals making this a awful fact. With the actions they have made of baning even-numbered license plate on Mondays they have reduced the amount of smog which is good. Another example is what is happening in Bogota, Colombia where you can see car-free days, where people any other mean of transportations except for personal cars. When the actions of both cities atre taken it is visible the cahnge on the enviroment. This great ideas help the crouded cities to reduce their levels of pollition and icentive people on use the car less.

United State that is a country that produces a lot of pollution have seen good changes in the tendenci of the people of using car. Studies have prove that the amount of new cars buied have decrease in the last years. Also there have been a drop of the amount of people getting a license. This show that is a county support public transportation and make programs that will make people use less the cars they will have a positive result.

Walking and using a bike is good for the personal healt. The less using of the cars help the fight against pollution and avoid the rise of temperature in the earth. Obesiti and pollution are a big problen in the last decades but they both share something in common, they can be fought by using less a car and walking, being this the perfect statement that prove why limiting the car usage will be an adventage.

7890B0726406,"There are many ways of limiting car usage. Some advantages of limiting usage are people are much happier and safier, you dont have to hear the aggravating sounds of motors and tires screeching by, and air pollution is decreased majorly.

In the first passage, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two children stated, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". By this she means she doesn't have to worry about her or her families safety as much, being on the road is a lot more dangerous than walking. Driving you can never tell when there's going to be an accident, everything just happens so fast. There is nothing you can do to prevent car wrecks from happening. You may do everyting in your power to be a safe driver but there will always be other people on the road not paying attention and cause a crash that you can't prevent. Walking where you need to go is the safest way to get around. You don't have to worry about car crashes or worrying over your families safety.

Another example of the advantages of limting car usage in passage one is, not hearing the screeching sound of car motors or tires flying by. Instead of hearing the familiar sounds of cars passing by you hear the joyful sound of children wandering around or riding their bicycles. People find it more calming to hear the sound of a child enjoying themselves instead of hearing the roaring and deafing sound of vehicles going by. When people are at home trying to relax they do not want to hear loud noises through their neighborhood. That's suppose to be their winding down time to escape from everything. Without vehicles people would be a lot more calmer, and relaxed.

The last example came from the second passage. It states that there is a major decrease in air pollution in Paris as they enoforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. One day they ordered people with even-number license plates to leave their cars parked or suffer having to pay a fine. In the text it states that, ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and Twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine."" With this being done congestion was down sixty percent in the capitol of France. By them taking control they reduced the amount of air pollution in Paris.

By limiting the usage of vehicles we make people a lot happier and safeir, you don't hear the annoying sounds of cars screeching by, and last but not least air pollution is decreased in a huge amount.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
6A0427BE649D,"Limiting car usage can have many beneficial outcomes for the environment around us. Avoiding car usage will drastically lower greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, cut pollution in big cities, and make rush-hour easier for human beings.

The first thing that decreasing car usage will do is that it will lower our greenhouse gas emissions. In Source 1: ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Rosenthal explained that because automobiles are very neccessary to middle-class families all around the world,""it is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes..."". Without cars there wouldn't be so many greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and global-warming could be evaded much easier. According to Source 4: ""The End of Car Culture"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Rosenthal again shows information which states that, because recent studies suggest Americans are using fewer cars, ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior"". With less and less Americans getting licenses and buying cars, greenhouses gases will start plummeting at a faster rate than ever before.

Also, lowering the use of cars will decrease pollution in big cities which are usually sorrounded by clouds of smoke. From the information in Source 2: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", by Robert Duffer, Duffer said that because of the amount of congestion in the city of Paris, ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". Paris could have easily avoided the ban on driving if they stopped using cars so much, which would in turn decrease the amount of pollution in the sky. There was a similar situation in Source 3: ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, where in Bogota, Colombia the government created a car-free day where no cars were used at all and people like Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman, said that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"". Another big city is lowering their amount of pollution as well just because they are using cars less.

In addition, an environment less reliant on automobiles creates easier traffic and a more relaxing road to travel upon. In Source 1, a media trainer and mother of two called Heidrun Walter, recalled that ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"". Now, more people won't have the same stress they had in the morning when they had to worry about the amount of cars on the road. In Source 4, Selsky explained that the new car-free day will be ""leaving the sreets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"". Without the everyday clutter of cars, streets will easily be more open and easier to drive upon.

Although limiting car use seems a bit distant at the moment and very hard to accomplish all around the world, with less cars there will be less greenhouse gases, pollution, and traffic on the road.                                         ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
551EBF009592,"The advantages of limiting car usage is very important, to us and everyone. that is why we must learn to take care of our car and stuff. Our car help's us get around and go to different places. Like , the mall, walmart, resturant, shoe place, and tones of other places. Scientist and researcher's use their basic knowledge to discover the limiting car usage and sometimes predict. But american's love for car's have been cooling . so far , so good automobiles have been an important travel for us now and back then for the people. Dufferent things are converging, which that we suggest are witnessing a long term -term cultural shift. With changes, people find less reason to resume the habit. many studies have been tested now and last year.

It has been that young people, decresed down than back then. Automobiles are like surbubs. there where middle families from every where tend to make their home. 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission's. In the US, the environmental protection agency (EPA) goes around various countries and check the enviroment for our car's. that's why you have to be very careful and be also caution.

The goal is to promote transportation and reduce smog. violator's faced $25.00 fins and it wasn't pretty either. day's without cars is just days without nothing. this world we live is full of many things to learn and new evidence that has to be proven.

So, you should always thank technology and the impact it has on. for you, and for everyone else. Different things are coming and different pact is forming. all the development since world war II has been centered on the car. that will have to change then and now . so here's all you need to know about limiting car usage.

0E938F8D102D,"To many, it is a necessity. To others, its a waste of money. Cars have been a growing industry ever since the Model-T, but over the last few years automobiles may soon start to look like a thing of the past. There have been many efforts to reduce car use because it is better for the enviorment, creates a more social atmosphere, and the best of all it is cheaper.

Could you imagine major streets, cities, and highways almost deserted of those four wheeled gas guzzlers? Well annualy in Bogota, Columbia citizens participate, or for many ""celebrate"" no car day. Other forms of transportation such as skating, biking, or walking are very common as violaters of no car day face twenty five dollar fines. Many enjoy the holiday like Carlos Plaza, who rode his two-seat bike to work with his wife. It is a day to be socializing with others, not locked up in your vehicle but to get out and enjoy the fresh air before it is all polluted and blown out the exhaust. The day alone has caused a blooming of parks, and restraunts throughout the city. With less drivers out on the road, this day is traffic free and extremely safe as well. This is not only a common trend in Colombia, but is beginning to be seen in the United States as well. Teens have begun using their summer-life to being in carpools or riding the bus to not only get around enviormentally, but to also meet and be with freinds and develop a more social community. This can be seen through carpooling apps and cell phones to arrange other forms of transportation.

Over the years there has been a push to use more eco-friendly cars such as hybrids, or electric cars. But what about not driving a car at all? Many have made this change in Vauban, Germany where residents of this upper-class community have gone motor free, and given up cars. This suburban area alone is a  huge effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, similar to citizens in paris who have lost their driving privledges due to the extreme ammount of smog in their city. By banning odd numbered plates from driving on monday, and even numbered plates from driving on tuesday, pedestrians hopped on trams and bicycles to commute the rest of their day. Each time you firie up your engine, carbon monoxide and other pollutious gas is released into the atmosphere, causing a widening hole in the ozone layer affecting Global Warming. In this two-day restriction, smog was significantly reduced throughout the city.

Many gimmance and frown as they fill up their gas tank, knowing they just spent forty dollars on gasoline, and will be right back at the same pump next week. Money makes the world go around, and spending less on cars, highways and other expenses could brighten anyones day. It is absolutely free to get to work on a bicycle, and New Yorks bike sharing program has significantly jumped inthe last few years as many would rather use manpower than horsepower to travel. Not just bikes but other services are cheaper as well like taking the bus, the few dollars for a bus pass or a train ticket is much less than a new toyota. The infamous no car day in Colombia has influenced money to be spent on wide, and smooth sidewalks for bikers instead of million dollar highways. Due to the recession, many are not buying cars or getting their license simply because they dont have the resources to afford one. Some believe the idea of a personal car is impractical says Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company. Bill believes it is best to use the comercial network of transportation for its lower cost, eco friendly, and a safer enviorment on the road.

Since the beginning of man all forms of transportation have been used, but are cars starting to become a thing of the past? On paper, the idea of not owning personal cars looks great. The enviorment would improve significantly, daily interactions with comuting to work develops a more social enviroment, and is of course cost reductive.

Every teenager can't wait until their 16th birthday because, for mostly every kid, that means that they go get their drivers liscense and possibly their very own car. Also, adults always look at getting a nice luxurious car and the top make and model of that year. Well, without a shadow of doubt, we should adopt the plan to cut down our usage of cars. It seems very successful considering 70% of Vauban's families don't own cars. It is detramental to our country.

In case you haven't noticed lately but there is alot of polution in the air.

According to article 1 , anywhere up to 50 percent of car-intensive areas in the US make up the greenhouse gas emissions. It is depressing seeing all of this smog and polution in the air everyday. Just a little heads up but the polution increases every single day we use cars. It is a shame seeing such an extravogant and extraordinary country go to crap due to polution. If you want to see how every state is going to look if we keep relying on cars then go to California and see how much of an eye sore it is. Cars are one of the major factors responsible for smog and polution. Polution from your car can lead to animals dying and especially humans dying from your automobile.

People today care alot about making and having alot of benjamins (

money

). Everyone wants to be rich and have the most expensive types of stuff, lets face it who doesn't. If you cut back on putting money towards your car then that would save you a ton of money. Just imagine if you didn't own a car, think about all of the things you would't have to buy and pay for. Cars are expensive just to buy in the first place let alone having to pay for gas and maintain it and all of that stuff that needs to be done to it. Also say goodbye to the mechanic visits and having to deal with the stress that comes from them. It would cost less money to not own a car and just take city transportation via bus or taxi or even car pool. You could even go the healthy route and ride your bike or walk to places close by. There are many cheaper ways of getting places besides cars.

Cars can be very dangerous at times and driving can be as well. You are at a greater risk of getting into a car accident than getting into a bicycle accident. Car accidents happen everyday and most of the time they are fatal. Coming from personal experience trust me, being in a car accident is not fun and is really scary and nerveracking. It can also haunt you for the rest of your life. I almost lost my dad a couple years ago due to a terrible car accident that we were involved in that wasn't our fault. He hasn't worked since that day because he hasn't been healthy enough to do what he was doing. We both, still to this day, feel the gruling affects from that accident physically, mentally, and emotionally. It took a toll on us and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder what would of been if we didn't get into that accident. So wouldn't you feel more safe in a bus knowing that your less likely to get hurt than in a car.

Without question it is neccesary to cut back on car usage and start going green and using public transportation instead. Cars are a crucial part of our polution today and that can easily change. All signs point towards the better option being to take a step back from cars for a little bit and see what the result is. Atleast once a week say that you can't use cars as transportation. This idea seems very good and well thought out and it will definetly show improvements that we want to see. So lets do it and see how much it affects our country. I know it will change it and make it better!               ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

While Bogota only bans cars for the length of a full day; Vuaban doesn't ban cars, but the prices are well expensive and there are not many parking spaces in the surburban city. Limited car usage can reduce smog and greenhouse levels, and with the advancement of technology, limited car usage should be inforced.

The smog levels in Paris are absolutely outrageous, ""[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussls and 79.7 in London, Reuters found"" (Duffer). The smog amounts , according to Duffer, were almost at the level of Beijing, China which is the most polluted place on earth. By enforcing a short driving ban, set for only a day, on even-numbered license plates to clear the heightening amount of gases in the air, the smog levels dropped enough to release the ban set for odd-numbered license plates the next day. This experience proves that limiting car usage can prevent air pollution exponentially.

With the advancement of technolgy, people have no real need to go travel everytime they want to talk to someone, whether it be family or friends. With technology and social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Facebook Messenger, just a few clicks and we are able to have a connection with them. There is also the option of calling someone, so there is always a way to keep in contact. ""... the Internet makes communication possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends"" (Rosenthal). As Ms. Rosenthal has so clearly stated, why travel and spend money only to say a few words.

Although most people arent in favor of the cause, they dont know the real effects of the gas that is produced by cars around the world. The gasses that are released from cars are very hazardous to the ozone, and can cause environmental changes if too much gas is released. For example in Paris, they had  a almost near-record pollution buildup, and since diesel is popular in France because of a tax policy that favors diesel over standard gasoline, the gas released from diesel was more thicker and hazardous. After a bunch of air pollution built up, they enforced a ban that would stop cars from driving for a specific amount of time to halt the gas buildup. If you were caught driving when the ban was active,you were fined 22 euros, (or in american currency, 31 dollars) and people the declined the fine, the authorities impounded their car. Paris was generous enough to allow public transit and it would be free of charge, but it wasn't too easy for the companies to budge because they would be losing money.

In Bogota, Columbia, they have already been taking action in this gas problem, by banning cars for a specific amount of time, but this is their third straight  year doing this. This campaign originated in the 1990s and was said to improve Bogota. They have constructed 118 miles of bicycle paths and have promoted bicycle use.

First I like to talk about the disadvanteges for not having a car. not having a car means more walking or bike riding  and then there is always being late to work or being late to something because you do not have a car to drive. people need to have a car because they have to go to work everyday are just to go have fun or go anywhere.

The Second disadvatege for not having a car is when there is an emergency. If there is an emergency hiow are you going to get to the hospital or to the doctors if you dont have a car. Having a car is beteter than not having a car. For an example if a person gets hurt and needs to go to the hospital how are they going to get there if they dont have a car.

The Third the thing I like to to talk about is the advantages for not having a car. Not having a car will help people got more excersice and help them move about around. Not having a car will help with having more money to spend on food or going out with freinds or family.

The Fourth reason why we shouldnt have a car is having less pollution in the air. Also not having a car a will help with the space or room you need Cars can take up alot of space.

Paris bans driving due to smog came up with any idea that on Mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home of they would have to pay $31 fine, and on the next day motorists with odd-numbered plates would do the same. IN this article is states that ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescined the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" If they continues this the smog would slowly fade away and there wouldn't be a problem any more.

Giving that automobiles helps many people get around but it also slows the more important one down. According to

715CD819585F,"Many cities and countries are starting a new trend that is not using cars at all. Vehicles can cause many problems such as air pollution, congested roads, and injuries due to wrecks. Some cities have started some type of way to promote how bad vehicles really are and advising people on what to do to stop driving.

For three years in Bogota, Colubia, the city has a day called, ""Day Without Cars"" where in this city, home of seven million citizens, nobody can use a vehicle unless they are willing to pay a $25 fee if they were get caught. Columbians greatly support this cause by hiking, biking, skating, and taking the bus to work. This caused the roads to be clear and not congested like they usually are.

Paris has a system to help support limiting car use as well. They take even and odd numbered license plates and designate a day that's either even or odd. On the even day, car owners that have an even license plate are ordered to leave their car at home, and vice versa for odd. If they have drive their car on the day they were ordered to leave it home, they have to pay a fee of $31.

The United States has reached a point to where cars are starting to become unpopular. In 2005, the amount of miles driven peaked, and in April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was down approximately 9% below the peak in 2005. That is eqaul to where the U.S. was in 1995.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that some companies that are in the computer/cell phone business are making more money. In the United States, many people are using the computer and telephone to communicate with people because it's faster and easier to access than having to drive around town to meet with someone. This means that computer websites are making more money and the phone companies are making more money since people are using their phones more often.

Next, cars can cause major stress to some people. Traffic jams, animals running across the road, not being able to see due to smog, and car accidents stress people out because they are either too busy to deal with it or being scared that they might hurt someone/something or may even get hurt themselves. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter in an article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

Also people's health could improve tremendously as a result of limiting car usage. Walking to work could burn the calories that people ate at breakfast. Hiking, running, skating, and biking to meet up for lunch or for little kids to go to the play ground could greatly increase people's health. Since people would be technically exercising while going to places, they would be more proned to drinking water to rehydrate themselves which would make them a healthier person in the process as well.

The process of limiting car usage has started or has already taken over cities and countries. It can reduce stress, increase the health of people, and increase the profit for business.

Cars can be really convenient when traveling, or driving a long way to work or school, but they also come with disadvantages, such as the gas your car burns off can pollute the air, and cause issues like smog.

We've become so reliant on cars that we dont really get out much and walk or bike, which could lead to things like obesity and other medical problems. Limiting car usage has many advantages that could help the environment, and ourselves.

Air pollution is probably one of the main disadvantages that come with cars. The gas that your car burns, releases harmful chemicals that can cause environmental problems, like smog for example. That's not good, especially for people who have health problems, such as ahsma. I know from personal experience that my little sister has bad ahsma, and sometimes she finds it hard to breathe if she walks into a room where someone has smoked in even hours before. Image how the smog would affect other people like that. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air a bit. The smog cleared quite a bit just within a few days with the ban. They even recorded that due to the ban, there was a 60 percent congestion drop.

As stated in the last paragragh, due to the driving ban in Paris there was a huge drop in traffic. With less traffic, comes less possibility of multiple accidents a day happening. Less people would lose their lives, or be faced with huge insurance and medical bills. One time, my dad got into an accident on the way to work. He was fine, but the car wasn't. His insurance went sky high, and the expences to repair the car was unbelievable, and it was really difficult for him, financially, to pay for everything after the wreck. Limiting car usage, in my opinion, would be a really good thing for people.

With vehicles, we don't really have the need to walk or ride a bike anymore, because wherever we need to get to, we can just drive there. Excersise, to me, is really important. Walking, jogging, biking, ect. are good things to help keep things, such as our blood sugar in check. My uncle recently was having really high blood sugar levels and it was causing him to lose vision, and making him nausious. He went to the doctor about it and they informed him that it was so high because he doesn't get any excersise ot physical activities, he just sits on his couch all day, or when he needs to go somewhere, he drives. Medical issues like that could be prevented, especially if there was a limited car usage to where people would have to walk or bike to their destination.

I believe that with limiting car usage comes with plenty of advantages, a few being less air pollution, less accidents, and less obesity and health problems.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
99DB857021D2,"Millions of people around the world use cars, trucks, or any means of transportation, although some cities have started to limit or even ban their car usage.  This has both made people happy and others were angeres.  Even so limiting car usage is actually beneficial in many ways.

Limiting car usage is a beneficial idea because it benefits with the environent.  Cars have been known for polluting the skies and the very air that we breathe.  As a matter of fact ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe come from passenger cars"" (source 1).  This means that if this magnitude of greenhouse gases are being emitted by passenger cars alone then the air will be polluted and animals plants and other organisms will die.  Additional evidence supports the fact that car limitation is a beneficial act to society.  According to Source 3 by Andrew Selsky, the people of Bogota Columbia have been satisfied with the limitations of car usage in the city, the article states that ""it's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution""(source 3).  This means that in the limiting the idea of car usage we can decrease the pollutant that poison may living things around the world.

Another advantage in limiting the amount of car useage is that it lowers traffic.  Many of todays roads are conjested by thousands of people using the road for their own purposes in shrinking the level of  cars being used we can shrink that by a large amount.  This is supporeted by Source 2, written by Robert Duffer, in this article he explains that cars, trucks, ect. are the cause of much conjestion and pollution.  This contributes to why Paris decided to pass a partial driving ban in Paris.  According to this source since the ban car conjestion went down by 60 percent (source 2).  This means that the streets are now safer and clearer in the area.  Other sources state that car bans in Bogota Columbia have lead the residents of that city to find other means of transportation to devoid traffic (source 3).  This means that if cars are limited then traffic will decrease.

A benifactor in limiting car useage isit eliminates stress.  Car infested areas have meant tons of stress.  By limiting the cause of the problem then you eliminate the problem itself.  According to Source 1 people in the outskirts of Germany have become more relaxed in life since cars have been banned.  ""I feel less tence"" one of the people the author interviewed said.  This key evidence means that if cars are limited then people can live a relaxed worry free life.

Car limitations are a beefit to todays society in ways that it can progress human society rather than pull it back with all the problems it causes.  Are cars really what society needs.     ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
8452DCB2606B,"Air polution, no money, and death, Oh my! Everywhere you go there are going to be cars. One of the most helpful and loving inventions of our time, it gets us from place to place in a short amount of time. But is getting to where you need to go faster really worth it? Money, safety, and protection to our environment all play huge roles when it comes to cars. The population of our world grows every year, which means more cars... Which means more air polution, more deaths, more of spending your money.

Owning a car also comes a lot of things. Money for gas, money for parts that stop working, etc. With gas prices up and down all the time, we find ourselves spending way too much money just to fill up our vehicle. You would be amazed at how much more money you would have if you weren't spending on gas and other things your car needs. It also requires no excercise at all, which is really a disadvantage to our health. Imagine what a simple difference can make. If we all walked or biked to where we needed to go, we're doing something great for our bodies and our environment. Not only is it jeopordizing our health, but our own environment's, too! Every single car and every single drive is polluting our air. Do we really want to end up like Beijing, China? As of now, they are known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. What about safety? Car crashes are one of the most common deaths. Such as two major factors, texting while drving and driving under the influence. No matter what state you're in, when you get behind that wheel you hold a big responsibility. So is putting your life on the line really worth it?

By limiting car usage, we can make a difference throughout the world. We can lower stress, death rate, air pollution, spendings, and so much more. If ONE day of the Day Without Cars in Columbia made a difference, imagine what a whole year, or years, could make. There are so many better options to get to where you need to go other than cars, such as bikes. So what if you don't get there as fast as you would in a car? The point is, you're still getting there. You're also not putting you and other's lives on the line.

295D0A2F0BE9,"To begin with, the advantages of limiting car usage, for example Vauban Germany Residents of this upscale community are suburban poineers, they gave up their cars just to save up and move. Some street parking areas, driveways, and homes with garages are generally forbidden in this experiment. Car ownerships also has to buy land jus for parking and to sit their cars on, their ownership is only allowed that garages at the edge of the development where they buy space and homes for the cars. The percentage of Vauban's Germany families that do not own cars is 70% and its 57% of families that sold their car just to move here. The autouse of the car separates the united states from the suburban life that is a movement called ""smart planning"". Passenger cars are responsible fro 12% of greenhouse gas emission in Europe. Up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the untied states.

In Addition to, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city, if your car didnt have a license plate that means to leave the car at home or drive it instead and get a ($31) fine. It was 4,000 drivers was fined, according to the passage it was Twenty-seven people who had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. The passage says that 60% in the captial of France. after five-days of intensifying smog, the smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Disels make up 67% of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3% average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, says the Reuters. Reuters found that Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london.

Finally, Bogota Columbia is a program thats set up to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was 3 straight years cars had been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The passage says "" their goal is to promote alternative transportation and try to reduce smog"". Violators faced $25 fines. The businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s, parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city, uneven sidewalks but they have been replaced, new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have did over and rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.

To sum it up, people have to work together to the keep the earth and the air clean for cars. Cars now in days are expensive for people to buy thats what the buses are for and it really helps people save money and enjoy their life til they feel they need a vehicle for their kids. They want people to follow the rules and get their license to drive their car and things so that want have to get a fine for driving without what you need. Transportation is one of the biggest things in the world because people now in days walk, catch rides, use the bus, use a bicycle, and etc., people need transportation but some use the buses to help them save or people with transportation sale there's to save and move in a better environment.

EE34DF0C5C8B,"When it comes to automobiles they can provide us with numerous benefits. However, it would appear that limiting car use has far more advantages than thought of before: it can help the enviorment, provide easier means of commuting, and it can cut down on traffic congestion.

To begin, it would appear as though that limited car usage is a enviorment saving technique. For instance, within the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states of the exsistence of a small suburban city names Vauban, Germany that has nearly obsoleted the use of automobiles. Within the fifth paragraph of the article they talk of why it is so necessary for this to become a trend,""Automobiles are the linchpin of subarbs... And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes...Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe..."". This bit of information informs those that drive of the harmful effects that our cars are creating upon the enviorment. However, if we are to limit our uses of cars, and like the residents of Vauban, and find alternative means of transportation then maybe we can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that are being given off by cars. Similarly, Paris has taken up a similar idea. In Robert Duffer`s article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" he talks of the percautions that France has taken to driving and why. Paris has created a ban so that those who have a liscense plate that begins with an even number cannot drive on a certain day, and the next day those who have a liscense plate that starts with an odd number cannot drive. This all began because, ""...after five-days of intensifying smog... [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""(paragraph 14). Paris`s efforts to create less smog was a success and they now implement the ban on Monday`s and Tuesday`s. Due to less drivers, they were even able to reduce the amount of smog polluting the air. Limited and restrictive usage on cars seems to be very helpful when saving the enviorment.

Next, the near obsolete use of cars has made for easier modes of transportation. For example, in Elisabeth Rosenthal`s passage "" ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" she tells of the many benifits that limited car use have upon their community. In paragraph six she states that suburbs are beginning to be,""...more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" This meaning that there will be more of an ease when traveling and everything being closer together. No longer will people have to drive miles away for some groceries, they will simply either walk or ride the bus to their destination. They will no longer be stressed as to what time they have left to reach a store that is a distance away. Along the same lines, soemtimes it can be easier to not drive at all. In the article ""The End of Car Culture"" the author, Elisabeth Rosenthal, states how many people have found diffrent means of getting to where they are going. In paragraph thirty-seven she says,"" New York`s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities..."". From the information given, it appears as though finding easier means of transportation have become a new popular trend. Since prices to travel by car are soaring, the cheapier solution appears to just be walking, or as stated, riding a bike. Leading people to belive that the near extinction of car usage has left us with easier means of travel.

Lastly, choosing to not use cars more frequently has left us with less traffic. In Andrew Selsky`s ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" he talks about  the reasoing for this. ""...millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.""(paragraph 20). Due to the enviormentaly safe means of travel, traffic has become a thing of the past. This can also mean for the residents, a faster, safer way of traveling if they take a taxi or bus to their destination. Even Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company had input to this. Elisabeth Rosenthal was able to incorporate a statement into her article ""The End of Car Culture"" when on the subject of the decline in car usage. Mr. Ford had to say that, ""...pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" (paragraph 43). This statement can inform the general population that from the drop in cars on the road, it can improve our safety and save time because of the fewer motorist on the road. That traffic is nearing an end which can be a new age in which traffic is gone. Which is why, when people choose not to use cars it can help to reduce traffic.

In conclusion, when it comes to automobiles they can provide us with numerous benefits. However, it would appear that limiting car use has far more advantages than thought of before: it can help the enviorment, provide easier means of traveling, and it can reduce traffic.

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , by Elisabeth Rosenthal,

Paris bans driving due to smog , by Robert Duffer,

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogata , by Andrew Selsky, and

The End of Car Culture , by Elisabeth Rosenthal the authors show how cars are not a neccesity to life and how our communities can even be better off without them. Because of the positive impact on our enviroment and the increase of a community, limiting car usage is a serious idea worty of a second look.

Cars, especially in America, are a major source of transportation. Without them many people would not have an easy way to commute to where they need to be. But, convience is causing more pain than pleasure and startign to harm our enviroment. Cars just by themselves cause around fifty percent of the greenhouse gases that are emited into the atmospere. Similarly they cause twelve percent in Europe (par. 5) Logically it would make sense to find the root of a problem and change it to make the problem go away, but in the case of cars, cars are a root in the pollution problem, but many people need them to ge to get where they need to be. The easiest solution to this is to limit our car use and add more busses and easier, more acessable areas for bikes and walking. Pollution will lower and people will still get to where they need to be. Pollution is a major topic regarding the safety of our enviroment and cars have been a proven source of much of the pollution in the air. Using less cars coensides with less pollution in our surroundings. Paris, France was suffering from very high pollution in the air. To combat this, for five days certain people, based on their lisecense plate number, were not allowed to use their cars. Though not everyone complied, after the five days the smog went from the levels found in the worst city for pollution, Beijing China, down by sixty percent (par.14). In just under a week Paris went from being the most polluted it had ever been to a better, safer level. If a city just by limiting the car usage by half was able to make such a drastic difference in that time, imagine it being limited more over a wider area. There is a possibility of totally correcting the pollution problem worldwide, or at least making it better and more easily handled. Although the enviroment is important, cars are also affecting the way we interact as people in a community.

Because we have cars, we never really see the senery around us. We exit our houses, jump in our cars, drive, and walk ito our destination. There is no contact with nature or other people passing by. Limiting cars can lead to the increase of interaction and better looking cities. In Bogota, there is a day once a year called ""car-free day"", in which no one is allowed any use of their personal cars and fined if they do not comply. Because of this there has been an increase in new high-end resturants and places to shop. The community has also added more city parks and places for sports. There is no traffic rush hour and due to the increased walking the old broken sidewalks have been replaced with larger new ones (par.28). No one wants to not only have to walk, but have to walk on a surface that is hard to walk on and unappealing. Due to this, people started to create parks and sports centers for a nice place to be as well as a nice place to look at. And because of the increased foot traffic, there have been more people opening shops and resturants, as no one speeding by in a car will notice a small corner store, but someone strolling by, taking in the scenery will. In response to the increased foot traffic, it is important that there is somewhere to actually put your foot, and old cracked pavement won't cut it. If there are less cars, less road pavement is needed and more sidewalk pavement is. So, the old pavement is replaced with more pavement that is in better shape. All the walking and passing people causes people to be more social and to interact more often. The members of a community are more together. Mr. Sivak, a researcher, had noticed both of his children are not interested in getting a driver's licence. Everything they do is centered around walking, public transport, and carpooling. They don't find it necissary to have a car and licence (par. 39). The children of the researcher don't have or need a car because what they do doesn't require them to have one. They get a more full experience not being in a car all the time. In a carpool they get to socialize with friends and while walking they get an outdoor and community experience.

In short, cars are an easy way to get from area to area, but they are very harful to the enviroment and our community. They add pollution to the air and cut off our everyday contact. If we limited the use of cars we would lower pollution, casuse our cities to be more attractive, have better ways of transport, and be closer as people in an area. So, is a car still going to be your most common way of transport? Think of the good you would do to the world if it wasn't.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

01FCFE3F279B,"Driving is the primary way of transportation, to get from point A to point B. It's a great way to reduce traveling time, and traffic is almost nonexistent. Some people would say it's better than walking, or riding a bicycle. But what if we limited these polluting vehicles and replaced our transportation for our daily routine? Well, we can. Limiting car usage can help us from lots of city and/or regional pollution. It can improve safety and conserve the resources we already have. Saving even more time is also something all people want to try to accomplish. Limiting the use of cars can help make this world a much better, and more breathable, reusable, and not a time-consuming place.

To begin with, the answer to why we should limit the use of cars is stated in the form of pure science: pollution. All around the world, from North America to Asia, every continent has a majorly polluted city. Beijing, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, you name it! Major cities nowadays are becoming more polluted than ever before, due to gasoline and diesel fuel used in cars today. Overpopulated cities can have too many cars, and too many cars driven can increase the amount of polluted air around us. In document two, the capital of France, Paris, is home to almost ten million people. After days of an almost-broken record amount of pollution intoxicating the city, Paris enforced a driving ban for two days. Cars and motorcycles were forced to be left at home, or a steep fine will be charged. Even though almost 4,000 drivers were fined, congestion in Paris decreased by nearly 60%, after intense smog. Diesel fuel was the culprit to this pollution, due to France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel rather than gasoline. Diesel fuel cars make up about 67% of cars in France, comparing to an average 57% of diesel engines in Western Europe, according to Reuter's. The smog cleared enough on Monday for the French politicians to rescind the ban. In document three, Columbia's capital city, Bogota, had a goal to promote alternatives to personal transportation and reduce the amount of smog throughout the city. Day Without Cars was born, one day every month where cars are not allowed to be driven, or a fine will be charged. The turnout of people was immense, even though rain showers and thunderstorms poured onto the event. Mayor Antanas Mockus stated that the Day Without Cars ""was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Parks and sports centers rose from the city streets, and sidewalks have been paved for bicycles and ongoing pedestrians. Limiting car usage is not be a bad thing, considering we need the air we already breathe.

Furthermore, limiting car usage is not a bad solution to the global pollution, and is not a bad solution to improve safety and conserve resources, either. Teenagers all over the world are more prone to accidents than any other age group. Getting your license is great, and driving alone is equally as awesome, but having no regard for safety while driving? Not as awesome as it sounds. For an additional document, it's life itself. Driving on a daily basis takes up gasoline, and lots of it. On average, a normal driver takes up about twenty gallons of gasoline a week, if not, more. Diesel fuel used in pickup trucks and semi-trucks is more expensive, but lasts longer than regular gasoline. Resources have dwindled since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico of 2011, and regular Americans are running out of the food for their car. On the safety spectrum, looking out for a street to turn at, for pedestrians, and for people that may cut you off sounds like a blast, but safety and crashes/accidents end up to be a result in many driving situations. Many people consider for driving to be unsafe, due to the statistics of daily crashes on highways, and even intersections, which happen to be the most dangerous place you can have an accident. Those types of people have put a hold on driving, and have caused a decline in the nation's miles driven per person scale, stated in document four. As of April of 2013, the number driven per person went down almost nine percent. Factors to that decline may have been the 2008 stock recession, or the fact that cars got smaller and more expensive. As a result, more people started to walk to work, or buy a bicycle, like they use mainly in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Safety is becoming a subject that is mainly disregarded by citizens, and resources are becoming less and less, yet the alternatives for driving, such as walking or taking the city bus, are becoming more and more popular.

Moreover, car usage should become more limited because they are other ways, faster and more efficient ways, to get to your destination. Major cities all over the globe have a multitude of ways to transport people from one side of the city to the other. Taking buses, walking, taking the subway, helicopter, taxis, anything! Except a car. Car use in major cities is almost unheard of, as traffic is everywhere in a big city, and overpopulation can cause the traffic, or at least, be the contributing factor of it. People want to get to another place in sixty seconds or less, and driving in that matter never happens. For example, car use in New York City is busy. Of course, being ""the city that never sleeps"", cars are not the best way to get around. Walking or taking the subway underground helps get the people around easier and faster. As expected, a large drop in the percentage of teenagers getting there license has occurred, according to ducment four. New York has a new bike-sharing program, and it's skyrocketing bridge/tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities taking place. Driving by young people decreased significantly between 2001 and 2009. Woven into a connected web to save time, new alternatives to the polluting machines we call cars are slowly backing up into reverse, and disappearing from the category of main transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is the best option to acheive all of the contributing factors. Pollution hurts cities and their environments, even their people. The air we breathe is more important than the amount of time it takes reach our destination. Safety improvements need to happen to make drivers have common sense and to not run over someone crossing the street. Resources are limited everywhere, and what we'll do after they've been gone? That answer has not been found yet. Saving time is our number-one priority, and we try to beat our records every time we go somewhere, whether it be using the same mode of transportation, or trying out a new one. Next time, be spontaneous for a day, and don't use a car. Try a new way to get to work; taking the subway and watching a new scene come at you every two seconds; or walk to work and admire the time slowing by around you. Breathe the fresh air like never before. Remember: it's not the destination that yiou should look forward to; it's the journey.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In some parts of Europe cars arent aloud to be driven its a car free zone. This is to help the Earth from all the pollution that is being caused all around us. Having so much pollution can kill our planet.

Many people around the world want to help our planet. Driving cars is easier but it is very bad for our plants and trees and for our own health.

We have over a billion cars driving around our Earth and all of that goes up to the air and we breath all of that and that makes our day look ugly and the Earth not look so pretty. Flowers have been growing faster after this idea was made natural air gives us strength.

In 2013 as said in source 4 they have investigated that Americans are driving less and getting less licenses. Driving less cars makes us live longer because we are not just sitting their in a car doing nothing we are actuve riding a bike or even walking. For those ong trips that take ours to get their we call a bus or a taxi and pay them to get their that is less cars and vehicles that are driving around hurting out planet.

D150C1CD72D5,"Cars have been around for many years and generations. People rely on cars for transportation. However, theres places where car usage is being limited because of the pollution it causes to the environment and help create a better environment for the people.

For for starters, one reason car usage is being limited is because of how much pollution it brings to the environment. According to article 2 paragraph 17, Paris usually has the most smog than any other European capital. The smog cleared enough for the French party to remove the ban of odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. This means cars have been a great cause of the smog in the city. In Bogota Colombia, thers a car-free day in act. According to article 3 paragraph 21, the goal of the day was to promote other transportation and to reduce smog. This shows that people aren't considerate when it comes to the environment and don't realize the pollution they're causing. Therefore limiting car usage is beneficial.

Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it can help create a healthier environment. According to article 2, people would participate in Day Without Cars regardless of weather. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" explained Bogota Mayor Antanas. The campaign brought constructs of 118 miles of bicycle paths. Parks and sport centers also grew. This demostrates that people are determine to make the environment they live in into a better place to live. Aritcle 4 states that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year. This shows America is probably leaving driving for better alternatives for the environment and their lives. And limitation to car usage was a big key to this behaviour change.

Although driving has been abused for years, places are beginning to limit the usage of cars. Some of the reasons cars are being ban are due to the pollution is causes and it helps create a better environment for the city and people lives. Would limitations of car usage ever completely get rid of cars as a transportation.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
360718CF0DA4,"Over the years the amount of cars that have been manufactured have increased immensly. Cars help us get to place quicker by making less effort to get there. We no longer need to walk to go to the park or the mall which can take a long time. Although cars are very useful and fun to drive, it also has its risk like anything else on Earth. Which is why i think limiting car usage would be a great idea.

Most cars use gasoline or diesel as there fuel to get them going. This causes problems because the fuel that is burned pollutes the atmosphere and creates smog. Paris had this problem before. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer says that Paris had ""days of near-record pollution"" and they attempted to reduce it by applying a 22-euro fine ($31). As a result congestion in Paris was down 60 percent and the smog, as stated in the article, ""cleared enough for the French party to rescind the ban of odd-numbered plates"" Getting rid of the smog and having less air pollution would help not only the environment but i can also help us breathe oxygen easier. Limiting car usage can help us decrease pollution and increase breathable oxygen.

Limiting car usage can benfit us in many ways. It can reduce air pollution which not only helps us breathe better but it also helps the environment. It can also relieve stress. Everyone that drives a car knows how stressful it can be sometimes. Any traffic jam can turn a regular day to a stressful day. Hearing someone honking their horn, yelling ""Come on! Move already!"" and adding some unnecesary profanity can be very irritating. In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into big hit in Bogota"" Andrew Selsky says that for the third straight year the city of Bogota have a car-free day called Day Without Cars. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" states the article. A lot of people actually participated in this event even thought it rained that day. The Mayor of Bogota Antanas Mockus said that even though it is raining it ""hasn't stopped people from participating"". It was a great idea to have a day like this to relax and not be stuck in traffic which is one reason why one businessman was happy. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza. It's a great event that should spread to the world. It will be very helpful to us and the environment.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is very beneficial. It can relieve stress and reduce air pollution. It can also reduce car accidents which can decrease the number of deaths that occur in a car accident. If you're on a budget, limiting the the amount of time you use your car can help you save gas money. It can also help you excercise a little. Since you aren't using a car you have to use a different form of transportation like walking or riding a bike. These are just a few advantages that limiting car usage have. Limit your car usage, it can help you and the environment.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

It's getting to the point were we might even  run out of it and wont have it anymore and wont be able to make gas and trust me we use gas for just about everything!

My second reason why we should limit the usage of our cars is so  we dont produce alot of polution. we produce tons and tons of polution every single time we drive our cars and thats very bad cause it polutes our air and it not good for us to breath it in!

My last reason why we should limit the usage of our cars is cause it will vsave us tons of money! i mean keep count everyday how much you pay for gas and at the end of the week add thewm all together and see how much you waste on gas each weeek. also what if your tiers are no good nomore just for a set of 4 its going to bcome up to like $200 dolars !And then what is you need new light or new windshield wipers. ust think how much money you put in to your car. if i were you i would just start walking or rideing a bike!

DCEF930E671E,"Through out the past, and till now transportation has been a huge role in our society. In the past boats were the main and fastest transportation man had. Until a man invented the automobile which changed transportation dramatically. These automobiles made it much easier to travel around town, or even across the country. What the people did not know is the harmful effects these automobiles put out.

Automobiles have there advantages which most of the buyers look at, but they did not relize the disadvanges not only are they bad for the enviroment automobiles are the main cause of death. Countries are working to promote either car free, or car reduced communities. As said in paragraph 9 the United States is working with the Enviromental Protection Agency to promote car reduced communities.

You may be thinking to yourself well ''Im not going to ride a bike every I go''. This is true but Im not saying that neither are these agencies they are simply saying that try carpulling, use busses, trams, ect. Riding bikes is a great way of not only transportation, but also fitness, and its a whole lot less exspensive.

In source 4 it states that President Obama has had goals of getting rid of green house gas emissions, and trying his best to make America a more enviromental nation. Studies show that people are buying less cars as years go on, and less people are getting their drivers licence. America seems to be slowing down its rave of the need to drive and own cars, more, and more people are starting to use bikes as their prime way of transortation.

Overall automobiles have been probaly the greatest thing or invention to man kind. Even though they may have their disadvantages. We just need to try as a whole to be less dependent oni our automobiles and try to carpull as much as we. Another great way we should keep doing and promoting is the use of bycicles. Society will find their way through, and hopefully try to be as car reduced as much as possible.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
C11E53939727,"Cars. They're a simply luxuary that you can find anywhere from driveways to parking lots to just parked right out on the street. Nobody ever thinks twice about driving their car, after all they get us where we need to go in a quick amount of time. However, cars could be the most deadliest thing in the world, and it sits right next to our houses. From the exhaust fumes that fumigate in the air all the way to obiesity, cars are just a silent killer waiting in the shadows.

Now, a car isn't really out to kill us, at least not intentionally, but unfortunatly the worst thing about a car is behind it; the exhaust. A couple hundreds of chemicals float out into the air and slowly kill the Earth's ozone layer. Every year the Earth gets hotter and hotter as the ozone layer becomes thinner as more cars end up on the road. It really is just a domino effect thats still in the process of tumbling down. The reason why we don't think too much on it, is simply because as we sit in air conditioned cars, we don't notice just how hot it really is. But what happens when the ozone layer is completely destroyed? Well, just hope your wheels don't melt down into the pavement while your driving.

A cars bad streak doesn't end with making the Earth into a giant sauna, of course some people might like the idea, but what if our cars, were the reason our diet never works? As more cars end up on the road, less people are walking and biking to get places. Even now, more teenagers are on the road with cheeper and more efficient cars which means that combined with a teens natural laziness in everyday life, its like we've been giving a robot to replace our legs. Would you believe that some people would drive their cars just to get a few blocks up the street? It's absolutly tragic, almost as if we're just waiting for the end scene in a horror movie.

So, even though cars may not be waiting for us outside our showers with a knife, it's slowly destroying the planet as well as our health. However there are solutions such as carpooling, taking the bus or even walking or biking more. Carpooling lessens the amount of exhaust fumes on the road, and walking keeps our cardio up and is even just enjoyable. So before you grab your car keys and head out the door, just take a look into the sky and a quick glance at yourself and think ""do I really want to be overweight in a sauna?""

First things first, a car is the most efficient way to get from point A to point B. It travels fast and most cars now a days have saftey features that prevent serious injuries from an accident, unless the car was being missused in such a way that death is a possibility. So why could it be possible that people are rethinking their decision at buying a car? Well the most reasonable answer of course... money. The amount of money spent on a car each year from insurance to physical damage or new parts is outrageous. So much money could be saved from using bike or bus to get where ever need be. Who doesn't like saving money, this year alone there are millins of people unemployed and can't afford a car so why get a job just for one? That is one of the biggest reasons not getting a car could be a possibility.

Another reason to not buying a car could be to keep the body and the enviroment healthy. Not using car to go everywhere would definitily leave the possibility of getting more in shape. Using bike, skate board, and even walking/running. Obesity rate in america is at an all time high. Not only because of cars but because of fast food places and other junk foods possible. Keeping the body in shape is a great pro to not having a car. Also keeping the enviroment healthy is a great factor to not having cars. As seen in source two smog is an over developing threat to the enviroment due to the carbon and diesel left by cars. This not only hurts the enviroment that needs to be protected but causes an inconvieneince to the population due to the smell of the gas and hte wat it blocks light. This is something that needs to be stopped.

In conclusion, cars not only cause an inconvieneince to the enviroment but can harm the body as well. Also saving money could be a factor in not buying a car due to insurances and mechanics not having to be paid. Think right America, this could be the savior.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Theres already many countries that are trying to do something, France; the U.S. ;and Colombia just to name a few. Taking a break and not driving cars has so many pros and very little cons. Yes, you might have to walk and might lose some wieght but it may decide how much longer humans can stay on earth.

What comes out of your car, that's what you are breathing. Would you rather breath burn gasoline fumes or fresh clean air? Its your choice, every year billions of people driving cars that are releasing a gas ,CO2, into the air which is posionus to humans. What happens after the world gets full of it? I honestly don't want to see.

Not only is car pooling and taking public transportation cheaper that paying for gas but it also helps keep the green house gasses down more that if everyone was driving. A recent study by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives shows that more Americans are driving less cars every year. Join your fellow Americans, you won't regret it.

Soon enough cars are going to get banned and fines will be put in place that are given to people who drive gas powered cars. Do you really want this to happen? People getting fined just becasue they had to go to work or to see there family? I'm pretty sure you o don't, so lets make the world a little more car free. Then thus make the world CO2 free.

Now there's a reletively new car that runs on electric. Although these cars are not exacly cheap, but they are motorless and gasless and they don't release CO2 into the atmosphere and they look nice too. If that doen't suit you there is a hydrogen powered car coming out in 2015. If you dont think you can handle that then there is always busses, taxis and bikes. Then if you still can't find something you like there's walking, humans where built with legs, use them.

Think about how you want your children and there children to live there lifes and how you and the rest of the earth can effect them and how you can keep there lifes free of poisonus CO2.

Think about what type of advantages of limiting something like this. Throughout world today, people have been wondering what is best for their country? Should it be alright to limited on car usage? Ever since the first car was created all those years ago, many people in countries throughout the world have had a strong love affair with cars. But has that love for vechiles stopped? For the most part, cars have always been a major cultural popularity in America, and a large variety of other divrse countries throughout the world, but has that love affair with cars, cooliing down? It's been said time and time again throughout that it has been. If we were to convert into a ""car free"" world would that benefit us in the future years to come?

For the most part, cars have had many positive effects on the enviroment. It has also, had major effects on people throughout the world. Some countries such as Colombia have began to take vital action by banning cars from the road for onwe day out of the year. With only having taxis and buses permitted on all roads. Doing so would promote ""alternative transportation and reduce smog."" During this particular day many of the Colombians decide to hike, bike, skate, and do a variety of other fun activities as well. In the article,""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" -by Andrew Selsky Bogota it states, ""The rain hasn't stopped people from paricipating,"" says Carlos Arturo Plaza stated,""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollutin, "" as he stated while rolling down the street on his two seat, two wheel bicycle with his wife. For the most part, this day has benefitted Colombias enviroment and people darastically throughout the past couple of years, this day has even had more countries join this event. Countries such as Cali and Valledupar have also joined this event. Many believe that doing so has benefitted the Colombians tremendiously, and for the most part, it has. Sports centers, parks, sidewalks, and cities have started to boost up and bloom throughout the cities.

For the most part, the culture of America has shifted shifted time, and time again. But through the past recent years the driving population of american citizens driving cars has decreased darastically. The question has been raised: Will american citizens continue to drive cars, and if so, will this be a positive outcome? In the past years the worlds most common cars that were in usage are known as the Model Tand the Detroit. But over the past couple of years these cars as well as many others have deminished in popularity of ranking.  In the article ""The End of Car Culture""-by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states, "" Different things are conversing which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" said Mimi Sheller, who is a sociology professor at Drexel University and theDirector of Moblities Research and Polcy Center. she also states, ""The Internet makes telecommunting possible and allos people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Changes like this could have a darasticallly great effect on people later on. Likewise with all of these changes about car commuting would be decreed darastically.

Overall, throughout the world their has been many changes that have brought on many positive effects. The advantages given to us throughout the years has allowed us to communicate, socialize, and do many other things more then ever before.

The problem with today's world is our lives revovle around cars to get us where we want to be and they have become a status symbol for many.  The thought of being without a car scares most people, but limiting car usage is becoming more popular in cities, and has shown many advantages in the enviorment and in the communities.  For example, the residents of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars compltely (Rosenthal).  On the otherhand, Paris, France banded driving due to smog-only odd license plates could drive one day and even numbered plates could drive the next day (Duffer).  Many advantages came with limiting driving in these cities such as, less air poplution from tailpipes, congestion lessened, and indroduced alternative ways of transportaion into differnet communities.

""Passenger cars are 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the Unites States"" (Rosenthal).  This means if car usauge was limited than we could cut back on almost 50 percent of our polution in the United States.  ""Transportation is the second largest source for America's emissions"" (Rosenthal).  The limiting of car usage would also help and knock down cars as being the second biggest emissions source in the U.S.  Without so much air polution in the United States we could live healthier and better lives.  We would be able to ruduce global warmimg if we reduce the amount of driving we do.

Another advantage with limiting car usage would be the decrease in congestion around our city and towns.  ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog"" (Duffer). This means that traffic would die down as well, there would be no more rush hour after work, and the roads would be safer because there would be less people driving on them.

Lastly, limiting car usage would bring people to find alternative and healthier ways to get to where they need to be.  In Bogota, Colombia every year for one day millions of people bike, skateboard, or take public transport to get where they want to be (Selsky).  With people using alternative ways to get to work it would not only  benefit the enviorment as well as benefiting their health.

The answer is clear, we need to limit the usage of cars in America.  Other countries are doing it and now is our time to jump on board with the movement of less car movement.  So the next time you get in the car and buckle your seatbelt think about the advantages that could come from not driving today.         ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
9158A6D098B7,"Limiting car usage has lots of important advantages. By limiting car usage, we can, lower harmful greenhouse gas levels, reduce smog, and improve our environment and society. It wont happen immediately, but i do believe that if we start to limit car usage, that it will greatly benefit the world.

To begin with, cars cause a lot of the problems we are having with harmful greenhouse gas. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Paragraph 5, Source 1) Greenhouse gas emmisions are extremely harmful to the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases harm the earth's atmoshphere and we as humans, need the atmosphere to protect us from harmful radiation. By limiting car use, you are technically saving the planet and everyone on it.

Second of all, cars cause smog. Smog is extremely harmful to breathe in and is also bad for the environment. For example, in Paris, France, the government enforced a driving ban to alleviate the thick smog. After a few days of less cars on the road, the smog cleared up! (Source 2) This proves that if we didn't have cars in the cities that have smog such as Beijing and Paris, then smog would be much less of a problem and cities would be a much more healthy and safe place to live. Therefore, limiting cars results in less smog.

The last reason that limiting car usage is beneficial is that it will improve the environment and society. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth, sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramtically cut traffic; and new restaraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Source 3) This shows that by reducing car usage, it has helped the city's economy and created a better place to live for its citizens. Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company, envisioned a world where personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He saw a world that would ""save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety,"" (Source 4) This shows that by reducing car usage, the environment and society can be improved drastically.

All in all, I strongly believe that by reducing car usage, we can make the world a better place. By doing so, we can limit harmful green house gas, reduce smog, and change society for the better. These are only a few of the advantages of limiting car usage but you can already see why it is such a good idea. I hope you can take this information and make the world a better place.

One of many causes of greeenhouse gas is cars. Next, ""in previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highays and only 20 percent to other transport.""(para9)which means that its expensive and most of this things money is wasted on is things that cars need.

To continue, the author, Robert Duffer, of ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", he states ""after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""(para. 10) this tells us that cars are dameging the air we breath. Smog gets around fast,""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France,after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""(para 14)

To add on, Andrew Selsky which wrote,""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", says ""...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams""(para20) basically theres traffic. In paragraph 24, ""' It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife"". The Selsky states, ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have be replaced by broad, smoth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" now you can get to your places faster with no traffic and its a smoth trip and good for business.

""president Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get fortuitour assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars,driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""(para29) In other words not many people are driving anymore its not ""cool"" anymore ,if you dont drive you'll fit in more.

One example of this happinging is shown in soure 4: ""Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Companu, laid out a bussiness worl plann in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable."" As you can tell this recently discovered trend has caused major companies to resolve into making almost entirely new products.

The worl is slowly but surely loosing the desire for personal vehicles and it has many positive effects but it also has plenty of counter, negative, effects. They always has said ""no good deed goes unpunished"", all we can do is sit back and see what happens.         ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
9D65A8B52F4E,"Having a day where driving cars is banned instead of having traffic on the roads. Many countries including the United States are banning cars for a day or forever is becoming a new trend. The reasons that countries are doing this is so they clean up the air because the greenhouse gases have been a problem for the past couple years.

In Vauban, Germany the advantages of limiting car usage has been great for the suburban community. In souce 1 one of the residents said ""when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" So having only walking and using bicycles as transport the residents are better off without cars. Even in Paris they started the new trend after a near record pollution the enforced a no driving ban to clean the air. France had blamed diesel fuel since they favor diesel over gasoline and paris has more smog than any other European capitals.

Bogota, Colombia millions of the people during a car free day hike, bike, skate, or use the bus to get to work. They wanted to promote alternative transportation to reduce smog. ""It's a good a opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said carlos Arturo. Even Colombia's two other cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the car free day event. In the U.S president Obama has goals to curb the greenhouse gases. The shift in bahavior is because in a recent studies Americans are buying fewer cars.         ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
4A4C81F5F77A,"Everyone wants to go to the park with their children or grandchildren, or maybe just take a nice walk. With the way we live now everything will be too polluted becuase alot of people drive cars and dont take the bus,walk, or carpool. Yes, people should limit their car usage. They should limit their uses because owning a car is expensive, it promotes the use of walking and public tranportation, and it reduces smog/pollution.

Owning a car is more expensive then you think. In a city such as Vauban in Germany that has only two places to park, a large parking garage, and a develment where the car owner needs to buy the spot for forty thousand dollars along with a home. In places like Bogota, Columbia on their national car free day all violaters will be fined twenty-five dollars. It may not seem like alot, but it all adds up at the end of the day. In places like Paris motorist with even numbered liscense plates recieve a twenty-two euro fine ($31), and the following day motorist with odd numbered plates recived the same fine. Almost four thousand drivers were fined. Thoose are just instances where fines have occured, other expenses are gas. Some people who are wealthy and have money won't be impacted by this the same way an average family with three children will.

Most people take public transportation for granted. Imagine if we didn't have busses, trains, and subways. Imagine having to drive to New York City instead of the subway. It is not a pretty thought. In places like Bogota, Columbia that has a national day without cars people use public transportation or walk, unless they want a twenty-five dollar fine. According to Mayor Antanas Mockus "" The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" Cities such as Cali and Valledupar have also done what Bogota has done, and Municipal authorities from other countries came to see the turnout, and they were enthusiastic. New York is promoting a bike sharing program that allows people to ride bikes through the city and return them at any location. ""Mr. Sivaks's son lives in San Francisco and has a car, but takes the Bay Area Rapid Transit when he can even though it often takes longer then driving."" Even though some people don't take public transportation beacuse they are too cool for it, they might just need to in order to save the place they live.

Have you ever wondered why you can hardly see the stars at night? It's not because they aren't there, but it is beacuse the smoke from the pollution and smog is covering the view. After days of near-record pollution Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of all the polution. Congestion of the smog only went down sixty percent in five days. The reason was of diesel fuel which is more used because france has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Places like Bogota, Columbia who have a day without cars have a day for pollution and smog to be reduced, and places like Vauban, Germany who only have cars on the main thoroughfare virtually have no smog or pollution beacuse they don't allow cars in homes. Even though it's a hassle to change everything to do it, but by just doing one thing a time they are helping the enviroment.

Now that we see and know that the people of Vauban, Germany live with no cars, and the people of Bogota, Columbia have a day with no cars. Thoose places don't have as much pollution such as Paris who had to ban driving so they can reduce pollution. We know that in Vauban you can park the car for forty thousand dolalrs, or get fined for driving on the one day you are asked not to. All thoose reasons only promotes public transportation or walking. So yes, people should limit there use of cars becuase it is expensive, it promotes the use of walking and public transportation, and it reduces smog/pollution.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A5DEB6E371EB,"There has been a major awareness of the effects that cars have on us as a means of transportation. People question whether or not abandoning cars as our primary use of transportation is worth the health of the environment. The simple answer to that is obvious, there would be no awareness, no statistics, no movements to prevent the use of cars, if there weren't any issue with them. Eliminating cars as our primary source of transportation is almost impossible, meaning that the solution to this fossil fuel emission problem must be an alternative source of energy. As technology has advanced, so has the mindset the majority of the modern society's population towards the issues of cars. Has the mindset of the population surpassed the advancement of technology, or have we been ignoring the fact that these fossil fuels emissions have been detrimental to our environment.

The one major thing that has caught everyone's attention is that the health of our environment being negatively impacted by the use of cars everyday. This is because this is the problem that should catch everyone's attention. People have this false notion that we wont see any environmental changes in our lifetime, so this means we dont have to worry  about this now. The problems that we predicted would occur have been occuring over the past few years. A prime example of this would be in Paris. Paris had been experiencing some weather problems. There was an abundance of smog that was filling the air, and diesel fuel was blamed. Paris enforced a partial driving ban as a solution to the smog problem. By eliminating cars as a use of tranpotation, some questions may occur. How will external delivery companies be able to deliver. By not being able to deliver, these companies will lose revenue, due to the fact that Paris has a partial ban on driving. Since this is most likely temporary, and a ""partial"" ban, this problem may be eliminated from the cons list of implementing this regulation. But a correlation occured. After the partial ban of driving, the smog dissapeared. This shows that by eliminating cars as a use of transportation this would have a significant effect on our harmed environment.

Another falacy that the majority of the population has is that the only problem facing the use of cars as the modern society's primary source of transportation is that cars harm the environment. Even though this is the problem that we all need to face now, there are other tedious things that come with the adoption of cars. Bogota, Columbia, has had extreme congestion, has created a movement that has been so successful it has spread to other countries. This movement involves the population abandoning their cars for one day and using any other possible means of transportation. This movement encourages the elimination of cars, physical fitness, and the elimination of traffic jams. The population of Bogota is so dedicated to this movement, that they have participated n this movement through bad weather conditions. This movement treats itself like a fundamental holiday to have every year. ""It' s a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""- Carlos Arturo Plaza (participant of the movement).

As you can see the process of eliminating cars as our primary source of transportation is a very difficult thing to accomplish. Bogota, Columbia's movement to abandon cars for one day is the closest the modern society has gotten to this. For this reason, there should be an alternate source of energy cars should run off of. By the environmental issues facing the use of cars, there have been many other problems that have sprouted because of the awareness that the modern society's citizen has now. Through the support of cars as the primary source of the modern population's transportation, there has been an abundance of users of cars. Since there was an overproductions of cars, seeing how this is the primary source of transpotation, statistics have occured showing the true dangers of the effects that the overuse of cars has on our environment. By implemeting an alternate source of energy that is not harmful to the environment, this would fix the majority of the problems. Instead we have been focusing on self-driving cars instead of cars that will be able to sustsain our environment before it's too late. A potential solution is energy efficiency, but the number one solution is awareness. Encouraging awareness is the one thing that can produce more potential solutions.

If you use your car less or just use it when you need it, the amount of pollutants in the air from vehicle transportation would drop drastically. Vehicles are the second leading cause of pollution in the world behind factories. Cars are responsible for up to fifty percent of gas emissions in heavy traffic areas in the United States according to Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay ""In German suburb, life goes on without cars"". It is a very simple concept, cars produce gas emission, and using your car less can help protect the environment from pollutants.

The environment is not the only thing benefitted from limited car usage. You become healthier if you choose to totally lose the vehicle. Heidrun Walter stated  ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Limiting car usage can also limit stress in a person. Besides being stress free, if you choose to walk to where you need to go, you exercise and do not realize it. Basically, if you want to lower your stress, not be tense, or be healthier, just limit your car usage and walk or ride a bicycle.

Vehicle accidents are a major cause of death in the world. So, if you decide to not use your car as much and just walk or bike, that is one less driver on the road. If the trend of limiting car usage and walking or biking spreads, the threats on the roadways will lower drastically. So in turn, using your car less can help keep everyone safe and help lower the amount of vehicle accidents and save lives.

With more people on the side walks, and less people behind the wheel, everyone can be benefitted. From stress to gas emission, everything can be solved with limiting your car usage.                                                    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
CA72B4219DD8,"For many years, the automobile has become and remained a staple in the world as humanity's most popular choice of transportation. The number of cars manufactured by car companies has reached the hundreds of millions. Cars have been a trademark of American ingenuity and the evolution of technology. However, as we go into the great beyond that is the future, we must take into consideration the pains and risks of these vehicles, and if they are worth driving as the world population exceeds seven billion.

Few people can recall a time where global warming wasn't the main conflict of scientists today. The Earth gets warmer as pollution levels rise as smog around cities like Paris and Mexico City reaches an all time high. The polar caps are melting at a rapid rate as hurricanes ravage the mainland harder and harder each year. What caused this stuff to happen? Why, look no further than our friends, the factories and automobiles! These two have been quoted time and time again as the catalyst of the global warming crisis. With such an adverse effect on the ozone layer, governments around the world have to do something to stop it from rising any further, with nothing short of success. Places like France have realized the extreme rise in smog levels in the city of Paris, that they had to do something. So, they made a ban on driving for people with even numbered license plates with only a few exceptions, and banned odd numbered licensed cars the next to try to curtail this occurance. After a few days, it worked. The smog cleared just enough for the French government to rescind its ban on license plates for the city. Such a huge difference in smog in only two days means that making a ban similar to this could be nothing short of beneficial for communities around the globe. So why don't more communities take up the hard task of making this ban a regular happening? It's a slow process, but it is happening, in unlikely places. Including over in our Western European ally Germany.

Vauban, Germany is a small community town located near the border of France and Switzerland. This town is best known for it's extremely unorthodox method of removing greenhouse gases from the ozone layer. People have decided to give up their cars, just relying on other transportation like walking and taking a local tram. Street parking, driveways and home garages are just not allowed in the district, and this has caused a huge difference between non-car owners and car owners alike. Seventy percent of the population in Vauban does not own a motor vehicle, a large portion of them sold their cars to move out to this small, cozy little town. Busy sidewalks and the chatter of civilians outshines the faint murmurs of the few odd automobiles in the city. What started out as an odd social experiment has turned into a great community full of happy people. Although this type of community is generally unpopular, other countries around the world have come to like the idea Vauban came up with. The capital city of Colobia, Bogota, has a neat program they like to call the Day Without Cars. The title speaks for itself. Civilians would take one day out of the year to generally not use cars, to promote the likening of taking other modes of transportation to wherever you need to go. Countries in South America have noticed this day, and are looking to replicate it themselves, which ultimately signifies the success of the Day Without Cars.

Countries around the world have all tried to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, whether by making a community built around the non-use of cars, making a day celebrating the use of other modes of transportation, or just banning the driving of automobiles outright. As just of a cause it may be, Americans are still hesitant to enact such henious laws. However, if more communities are built around this clean idea, more and more people will flock to it. It just takes preserverence, a strong plan, and a whole lot of sidewalks.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Fuel is one of the causes that pollutes the air. According to the passage,""Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" In addition to that, diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in france. Compared to a 53.3 percent average engines in the rest of western europe. Robert Duffer states that, ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partical driving ban to clear the air of global city."" Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Moreover, the same goes for odd-numbered plates. With that, the smog cleared enough for the ruling french party.

All the countries should try a car-free day. Andrew Selsky said, ""In a program that set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during the car-free day."" Some of the advantages of having a car-free day can help make people see that its not about cars or bikes. Even so, Those things are just damaging the air and making it harder to live and breathe. Also stated in the article was that, "" It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by board, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. Futhermore, it would help so people can see the world without cars and not pollute the air.

By giving some of the dangerous stuff that we use daily a break. We will see great turn outs and good things happen.

One advantage is that you will be a happier person. Another reason is that global warming will decrease rapidly. And also you will no have to spend money on gas so that would be more money in your pocket.

The amount of poeple that drive now is honestly crazy. With there being so many people on the road, there can be many things that go wrong. For example, car accidents. So many car accidents happen daily and unfortunantly, many people die from it. Also, road rage happens in many people. Say someone cuts you off, you get mad right? Then you may start to yell or get very tense. Many people are very tense drivers which may cause stress. If you drive less, you will not have as many of these problems.

Global warming is increasing rapidly recenlty. Global warming is very bad for the earth and could and is causing very many problems. In America, global warming is increasing very fast. Things like President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions would help to decrease global warming. Cars and a big lead in to global warming. So with less people driving cars, that could be a way to end global warming.

Millions of dollars are spend on gas money to be put into peoples cars. If people do stop driving as much as they do now, could you imagine the amount of money that would be saved?

A car is the number way that people get from point A to B, but this is not the case throughout the world. A lot of countries have taken to effect the amount of damage a car can do, so they are beginning to limit car usage. They are beginning to realize that there are benefits from not having to crank up a car every time they have to go to the store thats a minute or two up the road, or every time they have to go to school, or what ever the case may be. A lot of them are coming to the conclusion that by limiting the car usage will, lower the amount of pollution and smog that is released in the air, lower the stress on having to worry about gas prices, and citizens will be more motivated to work and etc.

The amount of pollution that is let out into the air every day is ridiculous. In a lot of countries, smog has become a big issue even with out the effects of car usage. Car usage only makes it worst. In France, there was recored to be a numerous amount of cases where they reported a lot of congestion in the air, due to tha gas that was let out in the air due to the usages of the car. Paris began to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Paris has more smog than other European capitals, it was recorded that Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, with Brussels having only 144 and London having 79.7. They began to momentarliy stop mitir vehicles dropping the amount on congestion to 60 percent.

Although the amount of excersie that is received is at an all time low. By banning the amount of car usages this pushes more people to get excersie. A lot of the people in our community always depend of the vehicle on four wheels to get us around, not realizing they have to feet. Most stores in our community are beginning to be built at every corner to make things a little bit more convenient and in walking distance, and by lowering the car usage a lot of us will have to begin to depend on walking, to get from point A to B. Which will, and can do a lot of our health in the long run.

Now many of us pass by more the one gas station a day, and begin to dread the prices of gas. The gas prices go up, and seem to consistitently go up more and more. A lot of those who work, don't like the fact that they have to give machines their money to get from place to place, and this only gets worst. Most children around teen ages who are beginning to get their liscense are not in the rush just for this exact reason. The prices of gas will only pull you down along with a lot of other expenses that people have to face everyday. Researchers have shown that the precentages in young people driving has decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

Cutting down on car usage can be very benficial for the planet, along with future generations of people.

First, limiting car use can lead to a better place to live in. If we were to slow down on the use of gas, there would be less wars over oil in other countries. We as a race can change the world, one car at a time. Lowering the amount of driving wouldn't be an easy change, but surely one worth while.

Secondly, giving up cars completely might not be necessary, but emitting toxic gas fumes can be easily avoided simply by switching to an electric car. There are many affordable electric cars that can help stop the fumes from traveling into the ozone layer, which can prolong our Earth's life, our lives, and can stop global warming dead in its tracks. Who doesn't want to keep this wonderful weather?

Lastly, cutting down on driving automobiles might have an effect  on saving people from car accidents caused by unfit drivers. Thousands of people die every day from unnecessary car usage. If we were to cut the amount of driving in half, the rate of death due to car accidents would find a steep decline.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can make the world a better place.

Using a car is expensive for everybody because think of if you get into an accident and it was your fault you have to then pay for your car and the opposing persons car. It can also be a health hazar where if you live in a big city with lots of running cars then it can be dangerous to be breathing in all those chemicals and you might end up getting a diseas or condition like maybe cancer of the lungs or bronchitis.

To begin with, the expenses of a car can be very high and very low, depending on where you stand on it. but if you ever get into an accident and its your fault and you have to payoff the other person and also pay for your car to be fix (if it hasnt been totaled). Payment of cars can kill you though maybe you wont have enough to pay your electricity bill for your apartment or you cant pay for an oil change so your car is useless now and you are still paying to have it look pretty even though you cant even pay for the oil to be changed.

To continue, think that you`re living in a big city like new york or chicago or philidelphia. Now think of every single car in that city. Alot right? well every single one of those cars do the same thing they just are used to get to point A to point B. well think of all the gas that car is pooring into the streets by just sitting at a red light. now can you see about another couple hundred thousand doing that at the same time? its pretty bad right? all that gas and chemicals hits the streets first then you can smell it from your 4th story apartment and then its stuck in there for hours. think about how bad that is for your lungs and all your senses. Im no doctor but id say that its pretty horrible and maybe even cancerous. just think about that before you dont limit usage on your car!

For a conclusion, id like you to remember that cars are not just transportation but also chemical exhausters that have the effect to kill any man or women of any age. So maybe just maybe if you limited car usage you might be saving a life and also not spending to much money on your car and more on bills to be saving your own life cause water and electricity bills are some of the most expensive bills out there.

CD458566BA1C,"Did you know not haveing a car can make you happier. In Vauban,Gremany it costs 40,000 dollars for your home and garage. Because of this 70 percent of the population does not own a car and 57 precent of that sold there car to live there. Many of there residents say there much happier without a car. One offical named Heidrun Walter explained how ""When i had my car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" and its true driving makes you stressed.

Not only not have a car makes you happy but it also can save the ecosystem. Green house gas is a big problem in the world now. Carbon dioxide slowly filling are planet. Acts like Vauban, and others like it, can influnce the world to change from the dangeruos road that we desided to take. But Europe produces 12 precent of green house gas, America on the other hand produces 50 precent of green house gas. America needs to change or we all die off.

Paris has more smog then any other European capitals. Come on if you don't think thats terrable then you need a new mind set because this is evolving into a problem. They say that diesel fual is to blame. because 67 precent of Paris has diesel fuel. I think its because theres, I dont know, A billion people driving at the same time.

This concludes that we need to stop using automobiles. Because its killing are eco system and we can do it . Many small cities are doing it and there happy. So why do we have to be mad and lazy when we can be happy and active.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B06F578C46DA,"The advantages of limiting car usage is a good thing because some people might feel stress out when they are behind the wheel but thanks to the limitied  usage of cars people can just walk and keep a calm mind and stress free. Also there would be more space becaues the car garge can used for somthing else like making stores. Then there will be less greenhouse gas. then we will more money. Finaly that is some advantages of limiting car usage.

One advantages of limiting car usage is the lack of tense or stress you will feel when you are walking instead of driving. When you are driving you feel so stressed out because you are nervues that you might hit some or might crash on the side of the road. Then you will have more of your time instead of rushing to get some were you will feel calm chilled and relaxed becaues you are walking the stress away. Next you will be able to spend more time with your friends and talk to them more instead of texting them and get in a reck. finaly that is my advantage of limiting car usage.

Second reason why is do to the lack of parking lots garages there will be more space for something more need a hospiltle or a store for food. Then we will have space for more homes so it will cut down the amout of homless people on the street. Also the lack of parking will help decress the amout of death in some because there will be less people starving on the streets. Then there will be spaces for resetraunts,fast food,and other places were people can work at so there will be more jobs avaiable. Finaly that is another advantage in the lack of car usage.

Third reason is there will be less greenhouse gases in the air. Then do to the lack of greenhouse gases there will be less polution in the air causing people not to get sick. Then do to the lack of polution the will survie longer and our omdoem layer will start to repair it self. Then we will be able to breath better and live longer. finaly that is another advantage of limiting car usage.

Inconlusion that are just a few possabilty's do to the lack of car usage's. One you will be less tense. Two more space for important places. Three the lack of greenhouse gas. That are noly just some advantages maybe there will might be more i the futer.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
5F2C19B28306,"America would be a better place if there were no vehicles. Americans could walk wherever they go, instead of sitting down and riding/driving there. With much extra walking time, we would probably lose a lot of weight and get healthy or healthier than some already are. America has the largest percentage of obese citizens, more than any other country in our world. With the loss of vehicles we could change that.

Not many people realize this, but vehicles and any kind of chair is a lot of the reason why Americans are so obese. We sit down for every thing that we do. We sit in the car, at school, at work, at home, etc. If everyone walked to their destination they would burn calories and fat. Just getting rid of vehicles would make a dramatic change in the amount of obese people. Researchers suggest that obesity is caused mainly by laziness, and vehicles bring that suggestion to life.

All I'm tryin to say is that if we get rid of vehicles then Americans would not be so fat because they would actually have to get up off of their lazy butts and walk to a restaurant or grocery store to go get their food.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
40861CBB998D,"Cars have been used as the main means of transportation for a long time now, but just because we have counted on it for such a long time doesnt mean there are not better ways. There are a ton of advatages for limiting car usage. Lower emissions, conserving resources, and it make us more healthier are just some of the reaons ways that limiting car usage will improve our daily lifestyles.

To begin with, one of the advantages of limting car usage is improved emissions. Today cities all around are poisioning people with toxic air, cars being the main contributers. But it doesnt have to be this way, some cities are doing things to change. In Paris, after days of near-record pollution, the city enforced a partial driving ban to clear up the global city. Also in Bogota, Columbia has made a difference by incorporating a yearly Day Without Cars. One day out of the entire year is not going to clear up the global air quality but it does opens peoples eyes up to alternative ways of getting around without the use of cars. A businessman even reported that it is a good opportunity to take aways stresses. For the first time, two other Columbian cities have joined in on the event. All of this just proves that cars arent the only way.

In addition to lowering emissions, another advantage of limiting car usage is it would conserve resources. Think about how many cars are in the world. THERE ARE ALOT! So every car in the world uses resources to keep it running, even electric and hybrid cars eventhough they are a great alternative. But most use fossil fuels. The world doesnt have a unlimited supply of fossil fuels. It took millions of years t make the gas we put in our cars. So eventually we will run out and when we do it will take a very long time to get it back. Also think about the generation of people after us. What will we leave behind for them?

Lastly, limiting the use of cars will improve our heath. Before the invention of cars most of the population who walk. Eventhough it would take longer to get from place to place it will benifit use also. American, sadly, is probally the laziest county in the world. You rarely see people walking or riding a bike to and form work on a daily basis eventhough in real busy cities you probally would get to and from work faster cause you wouldnt have to wait in the morning or evening rush hour. Its also ceeper than using your cars, you are going to spend a rediculous amount of money on gas in a year, so think it will help the environment and your wallet.

A study last year has showed that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Maybe we are the generation to make the change to other ways of getting around, advantages being lower emissions, conservation of resources, and a healthier you. So just remember the next time you have ot go to the store, just take a bike.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A6405231F460,"I strongly belive that if fellow citizens hold back on driving to get to point A to point B every time , just a little can help improve many things. For example on the streets their will be less traffic , which means less time for people to go where they need to go. Another thing that is benificial is if helps the enviorment. The enviorment has been getting affected by the tons of damage the veicles are giving to our o zone. especially Antartica. Also cars waste a lot of our resources which some of us use daily, with so many cars that are being driven every day is a everyday stuggle to those who work hard to get the oil from so deep in the earth . That some were talking about that is it possible that we can drain up all the oil?.

One of the large beifits that come with citzens trying to  not drive their veicles so often,is the amount of times some citizen will save to get to point A to point B. their will be lest traffic on the streets . Which is a benifit to all in the community. A great amount of people like soccer moms or people in general who have to take their kids to a certain place like soccer pratice or a sochool play have give up their cars . Finding another solution to get their child to where they need to be without having to use their own car to drive them there and just find another easier transportaiton.

The big reason why people are trying to find  a solution for citizen to stop having to use their veicles so often is to help our enviorment. The enviorent has gone through many changes which all were a result to something bad to occur. The ice  in antartica has been melting wich means the water level has increases alot and keeps on increaseing. in the past year, scientist concluded that 2014 that the hottest  year  which were all a cause not only beacuse of so many veichles being driven around also other things but mostly the bad amout of polution the cars are giving the sky . which is a advantage of the enviorment to get better and so that the water level can go back to normal and not have to experience disasters that come with the bad enviorment.                             ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Paris bans driving due to smog""

by Robert Duffer,  Andrew Selsky's

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , and Elizebeth Rosenthal's

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars and

The End of Car Culture;

they explain everything happens in areas where they suspend car usage, regulate it, ban it and seeing trends of areas where they just do not care about cars. Limiting the use of vechicles can have a emormous benefitcal impact.

One reason for a minial car usage, is that people tend to get stressed with cars in order to do errands or go to work. Following with Rosenthal's article, she mentions a media trainer with two childern named Heidrun. The mother states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" In Vauban, many people move there with having sold a car; that particular area has 30% of families using cars. Many people want to worry less about having to errands. It is much easier to have things closer to you instead of having to go far.  Continuing the essay with Selsky's article, in Bogota, Colombia; they have a car free day where everyone avoid using cars. Selsky quotes a businessman where he says "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In this particular day, he has a day to experience no stress and having the positive mind of knowing that this benefits the environment as well as himself. Therefore, limting the usage of cars relives stress even for a day.

Another reason is pollution, this is a huge problem around the world and many are trying to find solutions to less the effects of global warming. In Duffer's article, Paris takes a huge step in reliving their smog problem. They have banned cars, not exactly, they are regulating them by having odd number license plates go one day then evens on another. This limits the use of cars for people, in which later in the article it relieves the smog so they also relive the ban. But in other areas, people do not seem to have an interest in cars like America. Many of America's young people are not really interested in cars. Rosenthal explains how it would have many positive effects, "" If the pattern persists- and many sociologists belive it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. Thus, having less people use cars can be a solution to pollution.

In conclusion, benefits to limiting cars use is less stress due to not having a car and lessing the effects of pollution. All this is a major impact leading into a better world.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
02CFF35FC729,"Polution, the same thing that people have been concerning over and over, not because we can't change it, however because we can. In Germany there's an expirimental town where seventy percent of people do not use an automobile for transportation, also in Paris, France in order to reduce smog and polution. And even in Bogota, Colombia they are holding days in which millions of people go without thier cars.

The first thing about limiting car usage that typically comes up is, how would we get around? By the same means that a normal person without a car would, In fact German researchers actually attempted a study in which they created a small city that is only one square mile that houses more than five thousand people. by walking, riding a bike or skating +70% of Vauban's population go to work and school every single day without using a car. In fact, 57% of families living in Vauban say that they sold thier cars to move into into the city (Elizabeth Rosenthal).

In Paris, durring 2014 Paris repetitively reached almost record breaking levels of polution and smog. As a result of all of that smog, the city of Paris regulated the use of automobiles, this action came as a surprise to the nearly four thousand people that were fined $32 and twenty-seven people's cars were impounded due to how they reacted to the tickets. And as a result of this regulation, typically paris would have about 147 micrograms of PM (particulate matter) per cubic meter average per week, and because they regulated driving the smog levels nearly halved in Paris.

Moving to Colombia, the country of coffee and spices. In the city of Bogota the mayor holds ""car free days"" to reduce smog and the peoples dependance on thier cars. And in order to do so they premote the use of public and alternative transportation and actually fine all of the people that didn't comply a fee of twenty-five dollars. And even thought the fine was a mere $25 the peole responded positively and to this day people in the capital city of more than 7 million people continue to walk, bike and find new ways to get to work and school.

So all in all the tought of cutting back on using cars seems like a good idea that could not only fix the worlds dependance on oil and fossil fuels but also help people get back into shape.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
883F6C29FEA3,"Cars have undergone many changes since they were first established. Since then what is reffered to by ""smog"" has severly incresed. ""Smog"" is also what is called greenhouse gas emissions. Over the years many countries have undergone ways to prevent car usage in effect to gradually reduce ""smog""

In Vauban Germany, many people dont use cars due to the fact that street parking, driveways, and even home garages are tipiclly forbidden. Some benifits are, less stress, ruduced greenhouse gas emissions, closer shopping areas and stores in walking distance. In Paris, peoples driving rights on Mondays as well as Tuesdays are being revoked by the number on the license plate. All this in effort to reduce smog. Failing to abide the rules of revoked driving led to a fine which many people recieved, then giving up cars. In Bogota Columbia, theres a program meant to reduce the ""smog"" as well. This being called ""Day without cars"". Violations to follow the day without cars also resulted to a fine.

In the United States of America people have seemed to loose interest in cars and license at that matter. The peak of miles driven was in the year of 2005, decreasing after that, our percentage rate was 9 percent below the peak of 2005 and equal to the time period of January 1995. The decrease has been assumed to be because of the recession. Since the amount of miles has decresed, and because the recession people have not been as interested with driving beause how much gasoline has costed. With amount of miles drivien in America decresed, in Columbia, the a amount of bicycle paths had increased to 118+ miles.

Cars are on of the biggest greenhouse gas emission producers, in France, Diesel fuel was blamed because it was a favored from a tax policy. Paris tipically has the most smog due to the increased use of diesel fuel. Paris' amount of smog was 147 micrograms of particulate matter compared to a low of 79.7 micrograms of particulate matter in London. Usages of cars are going down all over the world. therefore reducing the amount of smog greatly.

The way many countries have new and improved ways to reduce the amount of smog is incredible. Cars are now being used less, biking, hiking, walking, and bussing is now easier to do with what is happened. Car companies have come to advertising cars they wouldnt usually advertise, becuase they are not selling as many cars and they are trying to appeal to everyone. It has been said with driving less it relieves stress, and has been scientifically proven to ruduce the amount of smog. Many people are interested and cars and getting their license, but it just has not been a priority. There are many advantages to limiting car usage.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
7AFF646F79FB,"Advantages of limiting car usuage? Is that even possible? Yes, there are many advantages of limiting your car usage, one of them being the money you'll be saving, another being less pollution. A lot of people don't care that they're wasting money on their cars or polluting the world, But what if we all gave up our cars and went eco friendly? Could you imagine how much money you'd save.

As said by Heidrun Walter in source one, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Loosing their cars isn't a big deal to them, it relives them of stress and money. To park in a large garage was $40,000 along with buying your house. Then there's gas prices and maintence, cars can be expensive. Paris had pollution and to clear the air, they enforced a partial driving ban. Drivers with even-numbered license plates were fined or told to leave their cars at home. It was only $31 in our currency, but it was 22-euros. Then the next day, being a Tuesday, the same ban to even-numnered license plates applied to the odd-numbered license plates. According to ""Reuters"" in source two, ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. This ban on the odd-numbered license plates didn't go through due to the smog clearing enough.

I know it sounds crazy, giving up your car, that's your freedom, your transportation to get from point A to point B. In Bogota, they have a car-free day. Only busses and taxis are allowed to be driving. It sounds completely out of the ordinary for us Americans to even think of not having our cars. Souce three says ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Anyone who violates or doesn't coroperate is fined $25. As said in the article, the turn out for their car-free day was large. Maybe we should try it sometime.

Source four says that recent studdies suggest that Americans are buying less cars, they're getting fewer licenses as the years go by. Researchers wonder, ""has America passed peak driving?"" Why is that? The United States has been the car culture. As said in the article, ""it is the birthplace of Model T; the home of Detriot; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""mustang sally"" which is also a cool song. How is it that we are buying less cars and not getting our licenses? My theroy, car crashes. Unrealted to pollution or money, but I think everyone has that fear in their head about car crashes killing them or taking the life of their teenager, so they stop driving. In reference to me, my mother won't allow me to drive untill I am 18 years old, the legal age to drive is 16. You can get your permit when you're 15 years old, only being allowed to drive with a driver over the age of 21. What's stopping everyone?

Driving is every where. How do you get to work? you drive. Grocerey store? The mall? you drive. There is more options though, you don't have to drive. You can brike, or walk or ride the bus.

22BCA723AFF7,"""All of our developement since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."", stated David Goldberg, accordind to author Elisabeth Rosenthal. Fellow citizens, the time has come to adress the complications of our over usage of cars. There are many advantages to limiting car usage that you need to take into consideration.  Less stress, reduced air pollution, and less money spent on such a worthless form of transportation. Sounds like an intriguing advantage, right?!

First off, stress can be caused greatly by cars. Although, this may sound absurd, just put some thought into it. With a limit on car usage, you hardly have to worry about your kid crossing the street by themselves. Say bye bye, to car hijackers! They are no longer a problem, neither is getting in an accident.  Stop worrying, because do to the limit on car usage, your chances of caos are finited, they are no longer limitless.

Furthermore, air pollution is a big economic problem today. Limiting car usage means a great deal of air pollution reduction. In article, "" Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"", we see congestion was down 60 percent, after five days, five days alone! Can you imagine how much better our health would be? We see many cases of lung cancer, due to smoke in the lungs, putting a limit on many lives. Also, air pollution is as well bed for mother nature herself, killing trees, our vital resource we not only rely on to put a roof over our heads, but also our whole source of living. Air pollution, is a definite economic problem that we can get rid of simply with the reduction of car usage.

Is your money being well spent? Not really, and you can thank the monster sitting in your driving, hiding in plain site. Cars need lots of attention. We're talking about more attention than an infant! You have to provide it with insurance, monthly bills and so much more. For instance, if you were to get a flat tire, you have to replace it with a spare, tand then that flat has to also get fixed. Money, money, and more money just being stolen right from under your nose, while gas prises are piling higher!

To conclude, if you were to limit your car usage you shall find many advantages, not only  for you but for the economy. Stress, is a never ending cycle with the hunk of parts you may call your, ""friend"". A reduction in air pollution has a great amount of benefits. Next time, you decide to take a ride out with your buddies in your car, take a nice good thought about all the exhaust possibly filling up your lungs, and if not yours then someone else's. Lastly, you no longer will have to worry about your money jumping out your pocket.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
50CD861B1F17,"Limiting car usage can be an advantage for every city. While there have been efforts in the past who decades to make cities denser and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six year federal transportation bill to be approved this year. All of our development since World War ll has been centered on the car and that will have to change. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here.

Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city, Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Dieseles make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city, uneven, pitten sidewalks, rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from incipient shift in America behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center said that differents things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long term cultural shift. Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the porcentage of 16 to 39 year olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age.

In conclution it has beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation is the second largeest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. It also has negative implications for the car industry but America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis.            ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
586C002A7B66,"Global warming is one of the main reason, maybe the only reason the is destroying the atmosphere. Humans today are trying to prevent global warming because if we continue to pollute the atmosphere it can very well kill most of the living things, maybe all of the living thing on this planet, including humans ourselfs. I think reducing the usage of cars today is a great way to stop global warming.

One of the countries that are taking action in doing this is the countries is France. Paris has decided to partially ban driving to clear the air of the global city. In the text it states that, ""on Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their car at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)."" This show that paris is trying to get rid of the smog in the air, and now they are asking their citizens to stop driving their cars, bike ect. Also if you don't partcipate in you will have to pay a fine of 22-euro. In addition one of the main subsatnces to motor pollution is diesel feul. the passage says that, ""diesel was the blame, since the France has...[a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" Since France favors the usage of diesel, this one of the main reason why they have forbidden the use of motor in paris. Moreover it states that;""deisel make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of the Western Europe."" This again also proves that diesel plays a major role in the pollution of France. As you can see France is making changings to there country due to the global warming.

France is not the only one that has taken action by reducing the car usage. The city BOGOTA, Colombia has also changed their ways in cutting down on car usage.""Millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams,"" the text states. What this is trying to explain is that Columbia has a program that prevents the citizens from using vehicles, so the whole day they usa bikes, skates, and take the bus, even some of them go hiking to wherever they go. Consequently there are some benefits to having a car, such as basic transportation needs. In the text it states that,""but America's love affair with is vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily.""Although driving is something essential to human needs these days, it is also very killing. As you can see other countries have taken part in this struggle to prevent global warming to get any worst.

In conclusion the reduction of using vehicle today can be one big step in slowing down the rate of global warming, although taking away cars me be a major problem to in basic transportation needs, it is better than killing everything on the planet.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
EE7AD297FD41,"Many places in the world, seem to be faceing similar problems; Traffic, pollution, and stress.

Some advantages to limiting the usage of cars; is to reduce stress, help the enviorment, and less traffic jams. In ""Car-Free Cities"" Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, stated ""when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Also in this new approach people are more accessible to public transportation. The United State's Enviromental Protection Agency has started promoting ""car reduced"" communities. This is a great benefit to the people and the enviorment.

Congestion in the streets of France seem to be a mayor problem. Also ""smog"" has occured in the air because of various motor vehicles. In Source Two: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" after ordering people with even-numbered license plates to leave their cars at home the congestion of smog and traffic went down by 60 percent. Since cars with certain license plates weren't allowed on the street certain days people were given free public transportation,""public transit was free of charge from Friday to Moday"". which has also reduced pollution.

In source three: ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" also demonstartes the positiveaspects of limited car usage. Even buissness man Carlos Arturo Plaza is talking about it, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Colombia's way to reduce pollution and the smog in the air is by promoting alternative transportation. If people decide to go against the day of no cars in the street, they will be faced with $25 fines. It was such a positive outcome that two more cities other than Bogota decided to join, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. But throughout time Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asuncion,Paraguay commented ""these people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" This campaign began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. this event has dramatically cut traffic; and new restrants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

The advantages of limiting the car usage, helps the enviorment by not causing much pollution to the air, because of the motor vehicles.

Vauban, Germany is a community that has given up their cars. The streets are car-free -- except for the where the tram runs. The residents might hear a car motor from the distance, and that is only when the pleasant sounds of wandering children and bicycle riders are not blocking out that noise. The people of this community live their lives healthier and with less stress from getting more excercise. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" says a media trainer and mother of two living in Vauban.

Over the past two decades, there have been many efforts to make cities better for walking, now planners use that same concept in suburbs. This approach places stores on a main street within walking distance rather than in large malls on a far-off highway. Transportation for America promotes new communities where people would be less dependent on cars. David Goldberg, an official from Transportation for America, says that since World War II, all of humans' development has been centered on the car. Mr. Goldberg believes this development will have to change and people will have to reduce their usage of cars.

On top of being a healthier population, cutting out cars would decrease the amount of air pollution. Transportation is one of the largest sources of carbon emission into the environment. In 2014, Paris had to create certain bans on driving in an effort to clear their air of smog. Paris usually has more smog than other capitals in Europe, and has even rivaled the amount of smog in Beijing, China, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Bogota, Columbia has made their own efforts to  lower the amounts of pollution. The people of Bogota created a program in which people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to get where they needed to go during a car-free day. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said a businessman by the name of Carlos Arturo Plaza.

Many individual cities have tried in their own ways to decrease the percentage of car usage in their population. Whether it be a car-free day, carpooling, or just people buying fewer cars, all efforts help decrease pollution, stress, and many other bad things. Traveling without a car brings many benefits to a person, their family, their community, and even the world as a whole.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
7380E424BD2D,"There are several advantages of limiting car usage. First and foremost, limitations will seriously reduce the emission of greenhouse gas and the production of smog caused by diesel fumes. Beautiful cities are being polluted as we speak, and that is something that could be so simply reduced. Limitations on cars will make the air cleaner.

If car usage is limited, as it has been some places, it shows to make the surrounding ares calmer. In places such as Vuban, Germany, where cars are almost completely gone, residents say they are much happier and less stressed out (Rosenthal, 2009-New York Times). Rush hours and traffic jams will be reduced, leaving more time to make cities beautiful again. Bike paths are being reconstructed in many places, in attempt to make as little imapct on the world as possible. Try a week without using a car. Use other commute options to get where you need to go. People see that they are less relient on using car commute (Rosenthal, 2013-New York Times).

Alternative transportation is encouraged. In places all over the world, people are stepping up and making a change in the way they transport themselves. Sidwalks are being remade in order to accomidate walking pedestrians (Selsky, 2002). Shopping centeres and diners are being located in closer ares, making it easier to walk or bike to them. Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company expressed his wishes for transportation by saying he wishes cities to have ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety,"" (Rosenthal, 2013).

Instead of spending so much time with car developments, limiting car usage would mean more time to other ares of development. David Goldberg of Transportation for America made and fantastic point by saying, ""All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" (Rosenthal, 2009). Instead of spending so much time creating things that will ruin the world, why not use that time instead to try and better it? Construct something useful. People are doing it all over, and it's proving to work very well.

All in all, having a limitation on car use will be much easier and helpful than people realize. The more we actively work on changing the world from preventable harm, the better our surroundings will be. Even if a car is driven on occasion, it will reduce the greenhouse gas dramatically, making a positive effect on the way people live.

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

"", ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Many people can go without personal cars and making smarter ways for transportation such as a bike, a bus, or carpooling with a friend to get to their destonation. A statment from the passage ""

Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog ."" ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifting smog..."" Meaning less cars make the road safer by limiting the number of cars allowed to drive on that certain day.

Places are banning cars on the roads on certain days to limit the number of drivers and limiting the amout of polution. From the passage ""

In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars ."" it states ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning."""" By telling drivers they can only drive on certain days helps the environment and cutes back on smog and accidents.

The United States is also joining in on the ""smart planning"" movement by cutting back on the number of drivings on the road and number of cars owned by people. More people are taking the bus now rather than wasting and polution their gasoline. More people everywhere are taking bikes, walking, and carpooling with a friend to save money and gas. We now have electric cars where we can charge our cars in an outlet rather than filling up the tank with gasoilne.

It is better for you to walk or ride a bike to your destionation its smarter too. If you ride your bike, walk, take the bus, or carpool with a friend you are impaction greatly on the environment by reducing accidents and limiting smog. You can also save money on not taking your car everyday to work or school, taking the bus or carpooling can do alot.    ",1,Car-free cities,Text dependent

There are some advantages of limiting car usage,as you know the fume inside the car could give you a lot of problem with heart your lungs when you breathing air. By limiting our car usage we could have a chance of protecting the new generation from the polluted gas that comes out of the cars. In some country  many people are happy even they are not using cars to go anywhere example In Germany life goes on without the usage of cars.

Alright look I get that cars are a good transportation device because when your have a long way to go It could be very hard to there and you want to use a car that is acceptable,but like If you have to go somewhere that is 1 mile do you really need a car to get there. You don't have to have a car to have a happy life just look at this little paragraph i have search up.""As a result,70 percent of Vauban families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move here.""When i had a car I was always tense.""I'm much happier this way,"".

When we use cars a lot it cause us to buy a lot of gas that cost a lot of money. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Many teens and adults died from car accidents it might because they driving to fastor someting else. All that I am trying to say is that cars can be good for the community or it could bad for the community. That is all and why I think it a good thing to have the advantages of limiting car usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A2E56155354E,"Most people think that driving is a top priority. There are other ways of getting from place to place. There are many advantages of limiting car usage. For instance, there will be no more pollution, most people stopped driving, and many people will gain plenty of excercise without the use of cars. There are many other positive ways to get around the city instead of driving a car.

This world already has enough pollution, but with the limitations to car use there won't be. Cars these days give off extra gas that is harmful to the animals, plants, and even people. According to Source 3: Car-free Day Is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogota, by Andrew Selsky, ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" This cause is a good way to lower air pollution. For example, many women and some men face the struggle of having breast cancer. On certain days there will be a walk to help cure breast cancer. It won't stop it completely, but it's a great cause to help cure it. According to Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes."" The efforts are strong and with more people being included will help make the air pollution lower to a better percentage. For example, when people are sick they have to take medicine in order to get better. This world and the atmosphere will become a better place to live if more people get involved with the limited auto use.

Driving isn't in the number one spot on things-to-do anymore. Most people stopped driving in America. According Source 4: The End Of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" The change in fewer people getting a car will also be a good way to stop traffic in the cities. For instance, if someone brings in chocolate cupcakes, but no one except one person likes chocolate, then they would take more for them. Same with the road; less people on the road the more room for people who want to or need to drive to some place. Also in Source 4, ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" A lot of people can't afford cars or even think they are a waste of money. For example, no one would buy something that they don't nessecarily need. People would take the money and use it for something more important. There are many advantages of limiting car usage. When people stop driving, that means there wouldn't be a lot of people on the road. There will be more space for people that have emergencies or important business errands, or people that just want to drive.

Without many cars around due to limited auto usage, people will have the advantage to excercise. There are many people that are overweight and need help to fix it. According to Source 3: Car-free Day Is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogota, by Andrew Selsky, ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, and skated to work during a car-free day yesterday."" Without cars for a limited time would be a great idea to take control and work out. It helps people live a healthier life style and build muscle. For instance, some kids are forced out of the house for atleast an hour of play time and get on track to become healthy. Not just children should be doing this, but also adults. Although when someone needs to get to some place, taking a car would be quicker, but having no cars has advantages too. Some people might complain and be too lazy to go ride a bike to the store, but as a result in the end, the person on the bike will be in better shape than the person in the car. There is nothing wrong in staying fit when there isn't an option in driving a car somewhere.

There are other ways of getting from place to place. There are many advantages of limiting car usage. For instance, there will be no more pollution, most people stopped driving, and many people will gain plenty of excercise without the use of cars. There are many other positive ways to get around the city instead of driving a car.               ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F9B111EB508A,"Fellow citizens need to be informed that the advantages of limiting car use could help promote better living and hope?fully a longer life span of this planet. All Americans do is drive everywhere,they never think about how driving effects the air and the temperature of this planet. Maybe we can be like Africa and have nothing at all. Or just maybe appreciate that we actually have something. Why would we ever get rid of cars? I do not know,but i do know that getting rid of cars is really stupid. Well as i was asked im now going to explain to you how getting rid of cars is ""good"".

One reason why getting rid of cars could be good is that you wont have to really worry about the greenhouse gases that are emmited by the exhaust pipes. Your air will be as clean as a whistle. The only thing bad about that is that those gases actually keep some places warm,but to other people it justs ""melts the ice caps."".

Another reason why getting rid of cars is good is that there will be less traffic and fewer accidents. So you'll get to work a little bit later than usual but you'll get there safe. You wont have to worry about about spending thousands of dollars every time you need a new ride,just a couple of hundreds. People rarely get their licences anyways so it doesnt really matter.

As you can see,getting rid of cars would be very beneficial to our society. Our air will be cleaner,streets will be safer and best of all,we'll have more money to spend.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A6EE4F2D0C0C,"Bustling traffic fills every available lane on the highway on your drive home from work. It's rush hour again, and it's more of a slow, steady crawl rather than a drive. You can't roll the windows down to relax and get a breath of fresh air, because the air simply isn't appealing; It's all emissions from the other cars, and the smell of burning gasoline is simply naseauting. It's moments like this when you recall the stories in the news about cities all over the world limiting car usage, and wondering how useful or effective it really is. Banning the use of cars has advantages such as helping to reduce pollution, reducing stress, and conserving resources.

Pollution is a prominent problem in every society today, and often times you witness ""Go Green"" campaigns on the television, with celebrities trying to persuade you, and call you to action on trying to save the Earth. A great way to actually help reduce pollution, is through a ""No Driving"" campaign. In the document written by Robert Duffer, he discusses how Paris partially bans driving in order to ""clear the air of the global city."" A system was put in place that allowed drivers who only had odd numbered license plates to drive on Monday, and only even numbered plates the following day. This helped to reduce congestion on the streets, and reduce the smog polluting the air to a safer amount. Before this was put in place, it was said that ""[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author also discusses how ""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment..."" This is expressing how a lower percentage of car usage compares statistically to a lower percentage of carbon emissions in the air, which stresses a healthier environment. Maybe now we can roll down some windows while on the highway.

Stress is a major factor in everyone's life; It makes things difficult, wavers a person's focus, and isn't beneficial to your health in the slightest. These ""No Driving"" campaigns are actually helping to reduce the amount of stress in people, by giving them a chance to do some stress relieving activities, such as bike riding or rollerblading.  In the first source, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" which is also by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a mother of two and media trainer named Heidrun Walter stated ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walter was able to stroll on sidewalks and smell the fresh air, all while listen to the sounds of nature and children playing, free of the sound of cars. In Andrew Selsky's article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" Selsky informs the reader that Bogota makes renovations in the district on parks and sidewalks, so that during the time of ""No Cars,"" people have enjoyable options as to how to get around the city. With such dedication to a project, it would be surprising to not be satisfied with those results.

Non-renewable resources are what power our daily lives, from gasoline to coal, once it's gone, it's gone for good. With these campaigns to ban driving, we are helping to hold on to what we have, and in a way, realizing what we have before it becomes something we had. In the second article, Paris banned driving to reduce smog, which they blamed on the use of diesel fuel rather than gasoline. The use of diesel fuel may be helping to conserve gasoline, but it's used in Paris because of a tax on gasoline, and is simply a prefferable price. By not driving at all, the citizen reduced smog, and conserved their resources for another day. In Rosenthal's second article, she discusses how Bill Ford put forward a proposal on partnership, hoping to ""create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" With the conservation of non-renewable resources, we are helping to ensure a future for those who success our generations.

There are so many advantages to driving, like being able to travel long distances faster, and being able to carry things with you wherever you go, but they are advantages of circumstance, and ultimately the use of cars is a price we pay with our health. The advantages of using other forms of transportation outnumber the advantages of car usage, both in the health of the people, and the health of the planet. If not using cars can reduce stress levels in people, or reduce pollution in a matter of days in densely populated cities, or even conserve the resources we can't renew, we should have banned driving already!

BF3728CF3A98,"Is the future really coming? Resent studies have showed that people around the world are starting to stop there love of cars nearly everywhere. in countrys like Germany,France,bogota, and the usa rates have shown that people are not buying as many cars a year as they normally do. Some countrys are even starting to have a national day where they are walking, skating, and riding a bike to work, and for those who do not follow the rules they are getting taxed and haveing there vehicals impounded. Can you belive that?

In citys like Vauban, Germany- People have to pay $40,000 to park they car that they own, the bright side is that they get a house along with it. as stated in sourse 1, "" 70 Percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" This statement is explaining how its not worth it to have a car in this town. People here are more oftenly found riding a bike or skating to there destination due to this ""car-free"" town.

Paris, France has been forsed to stop using there cars ever once in a while due to all the smog in there city. in Source 2 it is stated that, ""... Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave there cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31). The same would apply yo those Odd-Numbered plates the following."" this is telling you that there city was so bad tha the goverenment was forsed to have ther city be taxed if thet wanted to drive ther car. Normally paris has more smog then other places in europe. some dilevery companys were mad at paris due to there lost revenue. Although cars that could be plugged in, hybrids, and cars carring three or more people were allowd.

Bogota in colombia has set up a program to where once a year they have a day where no one in the town uses there cars. It is hard to belive that 7 million people would do it but its very true. Even with those who have to drive there car they get taxed a $25 fine. doing this international day has lead more and more citys to stop using ther cars as much and just walking because it relives traffic jams and other stressful things.

In conclusion the world is stopping the use of cars as much as they have been used in the last couple of years. We talked about three diffrent places today. Rates have shown that world wide citys doing this activity where they do not use there cars has truly brought down the rate of smog. bring down the rate of smog will give us a better future for our future leaders in this world and allow them to live.                       ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In other places the city in Dogota, Colombia had a car free day. Residents of this upscale community ar sunurban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives hvae given up their cars.

The problem with this world is pollution. If more people rode their bikes, skateboards, or evene walked to whereever they are going it wouldn't be as harsh on the planet. if people stopped driving cars around we probably have more people living longer today. But we don't, so i think no one will stop driving cars and kill this beautiful planet. Durning the ""car-free"" day in Source 2, it tells how if you are caught driving you will be fine. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. People just doesn't care now a days about what we can cause in the future. Beijing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. In a program thats set to spread to other countries, millions of Colomians hiked, biked, skated or took the bus to work durning a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily dovoid of traffic jam. It was the thrid straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in the capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote smog. Violators faced $25 fines. The turnout was large, despite gray clouds the dumped occasional rain shower on Bogota. Street parking, Driveways and home gargages are genarlly forbidden in this experimental new district on the sidewalks are not allowed and no running on the grass.

President Obama's ambitous goals to curb the U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior. Recent studies suggest the Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. That has left reseachers pondering a fundamental question. Has America passed peak driving? As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9% below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995. If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe that it will have benefical implications for carbon emissions. Many teens just are that into the whole driving thing that they rather sit in a room all day and play their games with other poeple on line. I know many of kids that go home and right when they get in the house they are all ready on the game. Its just carzy how someone can just sit down all day and play and play and play on a game that isn't really that fun.

As a result in the car world. Cars are hurting the earth and we need to stop it. we need to stop driving everywhere and start walking. besides, most Americans need exisues. So come on America, get off the couch and lets start moving.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Could you imagine living in a place without cars? Or even in a place where there were cars,but nobody used them? That is not a place I would want to live in. I enjoy driving my car, and many of my friends enjoy cruising dirt roads in their trucks. Driving is not just a way of transportation, it is a way of life. There are some people that don't want to drive. There are some people that don't want anybody to drive. There are people and governments trying to take away the right to drive an automobile on certain days. It seems like a huge hit, which is good for the government promoting it, because if people had anything better to do, the idea wouldn't last a second. Take the ""Car-free day"" in Bogota, Colombia for example. It was started in the mid-1990s. My source said that millions of Colombians took alternate approaches to getting around on this day. However, I must also take into consideration that this article was written in 2002. There has been a lot of change since 2002. In 2002 I didn't even know how to ride a bicycle, and now I've got my driver's license. I can't really infer how many take part in this event nowadays, but it said millions participated twelve years ago. I would think that if that was the majority of people in the designated areas, then they would've wrote the impressive percentage of people that participated. However, they did not. The article just says millions. How many millions of people? Two million people, three millions people, ten million people? It doesn't say how many millions as if to suggest that the writers of this article think that just writing ""millions"" of people is enough evidence to impress the reader. For all i know, only ten percent of the people in Colombia may have taken part in Car-free day. Also, it says the fine for violating the Car-free day is $25 dollars with the exception to buses and taxis. This sounds more to me like a scam to get people to use more buses and taxis. $25 dollars where I live isn't hardly anything. I can find that much walking down the sidewalk. In Colombia, however, i do not know how much that is. Especially in the capitol city, where I'm sure there is plenty of poverty just as there is in the majority of large cities in the U.S. The article did not specify how much money $25 dollars is over there related to in the United States. So when it boils down to it, the citizens of Colombia didn't have many choices for transportation. They could walk or ride a bicycle, probably the cheapest way. They could take a bus or taxi which would most likely be free, but it would be pointless because if the reason for this campaign is really what officials claim it is- to reduce pollution, then they're just making it worse having people take buses instead of driving they're own cars. I'm positive my car gets more mpg than the buses they're using in Colombia. So I'm sure there were quite a lot of people that participated in the event, but I'm not convinces they all did it for the right cause.

I am totally against taking away cars. I do not care if they take away cars in other countries. I think it would be wrong and unfair to the people, but it doesn't apply to me, therefore I'm not concerned too much. However, if they tried to ban the use of cars in the U.S, I think there would be an outrage. My dad is a self-employed floor installer, but in his mean time he works on cars. He is good at working on cars. If he wanted to, he could easily open up a body shop out of his garage, but he doesn't want to. He doesn't want to work on cars for other people and he don't care about the money he could make doing it. He wants to work on his own cars for no other reason than that he enjoys doing it. His dad taught him how to fix cars. My grandpa was also a mechanic before he retired. He had his own small-town body shop where people from all around would bring there cars for him to fix. He did very well financially for auto-mechanic. I do not share the same love for cars that they do. When i was growing up i didn't want to be in a garage, i wanted to be in a pool or on a basketball court. That's not to say that i don't love my car though, and enjoy driving it. I'm sixteen years old, I've had my license for about six months, and I've had my own car for about 9 months. In source 4: The End of Car Culture, the author talks about her sons compared to Mr. Sivak's sons. Her sons have little interest in obtaining a license. I know very few people like that in my life. Most of my friends and I love our automobiles and we love being able to drive. It's a good sense of self-responsibility that prepares us for the responsibility we will encounter as adults.

In a world where everybody walks, bikes, hikes, or takes buses and taxis, I would be miserable. I would hate walking or biking to work everyday and everywhere I go. Every time i arrived i would be drenching in sweat. I would hate taking a bus just as much because it would most likely be crammed full of tons of people who are incapable or too lazy to walk and bike to get around. If buses today are already uncomfortable, could you imagine them twice as full? Taxis would probably be the worst. They would be the only means of comfortable transportation. Could you imagine the price of using a taxi in a world without private cars. It would skyrocket. The fare would be outrageous. I hope i never live to experience a time where i will get a ticket and fine just for driving my car on a certain day of the week.            ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D03DCED5E72A,"Greenhouse gases are a major problem all over the world. Almost all forms of transportation emit these and people are starting to take notice. Heavy, dark smog hangs over cities for weeks at a time like a depression and by just simply limiting cars on the streets for a few days, an extravagant improvement can be made. With greenhouse gas emissions increasing by the day, some cities have begun to limit or even ban driving all together, with the exception of public transportation. The environment is reaping the benefits with every car taken off the street.

After days of reaching near-record pollution in Paris, they enforced a partial ban to relieve themselves of the intensifying smog. Even-numbered license plates were ordered to stay home for the first day and odd-numbered the next. They alternated every day for one week. A fine was issued to those that did not abide resulting in almost 4,000 drivers ticketed, according to Reuters. Typically, Paris has more smog than other European cities. In this particular week, they had 147 micrograms of particulate matter versus 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. By the end of the week the air had made drastic improvement and the ban was lifted.

A more permanent display of a city wanting to improve air conditions is present in Vauban, Germany. Cars are indeed allowed, but the only places to park are on the edge of the development, and a space can cost as much as $40,000. The main public transport still runs and most people ride bikes to get around. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and as much as 50 percent in heavily populated areas in the United States. This upscale suburban city in Germany is making impact around the world, influencing more accessibility to public transportation and stores.

Warm, Bogota, Columbia makes a celebration out of a nationwide day-long ban on cars. Warm temperatures tend to trap greenhouse gases which creates smog over cities. Only buses and taxis are permitted on the Day Without Cars. Violaters also faced a fine here but millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, and enjoyed the day. This day is part of an improvement campaign that began in the mid-1990s. Bogota has constructed 118 miles of bycicle path, more than any Latin American city. Parks have bloomed and other forms of transportation has been made easily accessible.

In America, recent studies suggest that citizens have been buying and driving fewer cars and getting fewer licences each year. Has car culture really started to diminish? The number of miles driven peaked in 2005 and has steadily dropped afterwards. If the pattern persists carbon emissions will be greatly decreased and the enviroment will definitely take notice. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, right behind power plants. The decrease in car commuting may find reason in the recession, and it may become a new habit. Wether the millenials will buy more cars when they have kids remains an open question, but it is very much doubted.

Greenhouse gas emissions from cars are very detrimental to the enviroment and even ourselves. Just by limiting how much cars are used in ordinary day we can preserve our earth. It is apparent that people already cut back on using cars for financial reasons, why dont we begin to cut back for environmental?    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

To start off, Paris has had near record pollution. There has been times of five day intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Just imagine what that is doing to our ozone layer. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. So if we stopped using cars for a while, maybe the smog around the world would start to clear up, and maybe if we stopped using cars for even longer we would be completely smog-less.

Secondly, people would probably start to be in a better mood and feel happier. Driving a car can be stressful and even sometimes intense. Heidrun Walter says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. She walks the streets of Vauban. The chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional sound of a distant motor.

Lastly, there are so many different ways to get from place to place. In some Colombian cities they have replaced pitted sidewalks so people can ride their bikes instead of drive. In Bogota in the mid-1990s they began to make bike paths, to this day it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle pathways. In New York there is a new bike sharing program that is skyrocketing. People needing to get to work can walk or take public transportation, they can even car-pool with a friend or another family member.

To conclude, laying off the use of cars could be a pretty good change to our environment, to us, and to other people and even our health. Walking, riding a bicycle and riding on public transportation is woven into a connected network to save time, conserve our resources, lower the toxic emissions to the air, and to improve our safety and the worlds safety.         ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E99928ACD4FF,"In many places, people drive cars. We know that driving a vehicle can lead to all kinds of pollution because of the fuel we use to power them. Because of this reason, people have decided to stop driving their cars, or take time off from driving them. Places such as Germany, America, and even Paris, France, have stopped using their vehicles as frequently.

In Vaubun, Germany, many have given up their cars and have deicded to walk to where they need to go. Their streets are completely ""car free"", except where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and some streets on one edge of the community. You are allowed to own a car, but you can only park at the edge of a development, but you have to buy a space for $40,000, along with your home. for this reason, 70 percent of the population does not own a car and 57 percent sold their car to move to Vaubun. Some families say they're much happier wtihout a car.

In Paris, France, a partial driving ban has been enforced. On some days, motorists with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home or they would suffer a fine. Then the next day this would apply to people with an odd numbered car. Almost 4,000 people where fined and twenty-seven people had their cars impounded. This ban was enforced because of the amount of smog that is in Paris.

Pollution is a very bad issue, and people driving cars do not help at all. All of the driving is very bad and it needs to be stopped. Programs which stop people from driving cars is very helpful. The partial bans on cars and banning them completely will definetly help the world, the air, and humans too!    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Imagine a world where there are no cars though. everyone takes public transportation or walks to where they need to be. Vauban, Germany is trying soemthing like this.

In source one: ""In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."" the writer Elizabeth Rosenthal states that they got rid of street parking, driveway and home garages are forbiden. The streets a re completely car-free except the main thoroughfare. Now, seventy percent of families do not own cars anymore and fifty-sevem percent sold a car to move there. People consider this ""smart planning"" i would too actually there are manty other cities who are trying to be ""car-free."" Most people like it and are enjoying it. They believe it could be a very good important serious change.

In the second source: ""Paris bans driving due to smog""  it not only helps pollution but also lives. if someone is driving with smog on their windows its just an accident waiting to happen because you can't see the cars or people around you.

While in the United States, Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced communities and legislators who act in this in a cautios way. Experts want public transport to play a larger role in a new federal bill that would be approved this year. Paris enforced partial of the driving ban to clear the global city. About 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine so this is many of the advantages that citizens have in limited car usage so there is not much that drivers in this countries have that many people do have. In Bogota the day without cars was a part of an improvement campaign that began in the mid-1990s. President Obama's goals curb the United State's greenhouse gas and it unveiled last week and it will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in the American behavior.

The use of Gas has increased more and more every year. have you ever came to think what can we do to prevent, or help the reduction of fossil fuels? in the united states and around the world people everyday are helping to reduce the amount of polution that goes into the air we breath. communities and legislators are acting on this important cause for our globe. The earth is our home and we need to take more care of it.

Fellow citizens what can we all do to fight polution? think about it... would it be that bad limiting car usage? we can spend more time getting healthy, like takeing a jog to the nearest fast food place to eat a burger, going to publix to buy the milk, or maybe to pick up your sibling from school? what if one day out of the week you instead of takeing the car to go to school you can easily walk or take a bus anything can help out the enviorment. Don't you get tired on waiting on red lights or on slow going traffic? you see walking you dont have to be in so much congestion on the road.

2E91E0D33A5F,"The car is a staple in modern day society by many standards, it represents wealth, sociatal rank however; on the more negative side of the matter cars are the result of a majority of deaths in the United States. Alongside the fatalities, cars also pollute the environment that is so very delicate. The benifits of becoming car-free are immense and far outweigh the ""negatives"" that come alongside living without cars.

Cars as many people know see them are recognized for their glamour and attraction, but what is forgotten somewhere in the infatuation with cars is the true devastation they can cause. Cars in the United States and many other countries around the world account for a majority of the fatalities in total. Living without cars would completely irradicate the fatalities due to cars as well as reducing the stress that comes along with having such a hefty responsibility.

Along with the potential danger to humans, in the United States cars are the second largest source of emmisions right behind power plants according to paragraph 34. Countries like India and China are among the top few most polluted cities on this planet; now imagine the imact of implimenting a car-free law. The amount of pollution would go down immensely and the effect that this would have on the lifespan of people living in those countries would be incredulous. Some will argue that this will negatively have a change on their life. And to that I would say, are you willing to sacrifice some of the comfort that a car supplies you for a better life for your children and grandchildren?

Many people aknowledge that buying a car is arguably the second largest and expensive purchases that will be made in your life second to a house. The amount of money that would be saved from living a car-free life would be incredible. Without having to pay car payments, car insurance, and gas fees every month imagine what this money could be going towards. Removing such a monitary factor would reap such high rewards that so many would agree is completely worth some of the sacrifices that would have to be made.

All in all cars are not completely necessary, and that implimenting such a thing would have such a benificial outcome for society as a whole. Think not about the present but about the future of the world, and by living a car-free life you are bettering the present community as well as the future world.

CE28B6B31CCE,"If we dont make a change now we, could be in a lot of trouble twenty years from now. Us as people dont really ever look at how much we actually are hurting the world and ourselves. For instance, limiting your car usage. That right there saves money for you and also helps keep our enviroiment clean and healthy.

First of all, if you were to limit your car use from seven days a week to maybe three, you would be saving a ton of money. The avarage person probably fills there gas tank all the way up once a week. Depending on mile per gallon your car ges it could be different, but if you were to only use your car three days out of the week you would only have to fill your tank up about every two weeks instead of every weeks. You would save so much money if you were to do that. Gas prices arnt cheap in todays world, its not like you can go get a gallon of gas for 50 cents anymore.

Second of all, used gas contaminates our world almost more than anything. The feums that come out of cars/trucks is the reason why we are having the types of problems that we are having enviromental wise. In source 1: In German suburb, life goes on without cars, the people who live in Vauban Germany only get to use there car everyother day depending on licsence plate numbers. They're making a movement and it is called smart planning. This town along with others sees how bad we are hurting our enviroment and making a change. These people are getting along with there lives just fine, in fact some are saying that life is better without having a car. They say they are ""stress free."" In source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, it says that almost 4,000 drivers were fined, now i cam see were some days you just have to use your car to take car of somethimg and that is totally fine because thats what cars are used for, to benefit us.

In conclusion, i believe that us as people need to reallly think about the future and realize that we dont have to use our cars as much as we do today. We can take a couple of days out of the weeks and not use them it wont kill you. Infact it might make you live longer because you are helping your enviroment which is definitley helping you.

D6C422E7A69C,"Cars are a very annoying part of life implanted in american history. They dont know when to shut up sometimes, just so noisy and loud. They fill the fresh clean air with nasty smog. And i dont know about you but i sure dont want to be caught in a traffic jam for half the day.

First off, they're so noisy and loud sometimes you just want to yell atthem like a 3 year old baby crying. Speaking of babies crying a loud car driving by your house on a calm day when your baby is sleeping could wake him/her up and nobody wants that. And when people are trying to get some rest at night a noisy car speeds by their window and wakes them up. Also what if you want some relaxation time maybe take a bike ride in your neighborhood or enjoy a cup of coffee. That would get ruined by the sound a car driving by.

Ive found my self outside in the city gasping for air and have wondered why that is. Well if youd turn your attention to the big hunk of metal parked in your drive-way thats the reason. Cars are one of the worst sources for pollution in todays society. Cars run on fossil fuel which when burned is turned into a pollutant and makes the air unbreathable. After days of almost breaking the record of pollution Paris partially banned driving to clear the air of all the smog. This smog can even be blinding from time to time if it gets to the point where the pollution gets too serious.

Finally, who wants to be stuck in a traffic jam all day. Not me i know that for sure. People have places to go and when there is a traffic jam because peoplewant to take a look at the car accident it gets pretty frustrating. Also traffic stress's some people out to the point where they do something illegal to get out of traffic. Traffic jams can also be very dangerous people can get in serious car crashes and be severely hurt or even worse killed.

Cars can be a nuesence in plenty of ways. More ways than i can think of these are only just three reasons asto why cars are bad. They're noisy, dirty and even very dangerous if your not careful. Getting into a car is like turning on a slot machine you dont know what will happen you might make it there and you might not and thats why they need to exit todays society, itd be better off that way.

62E7A0CF1527,"I think that limiting car usage would be something good. My reason is for less car accidents. Many people drive reckless and speed and this is what causes these car accidents. We can save alot of people from getting injured in car accidents.

In this case we can also save traffic and causing people to be late to their jobs. This is why we should limit them also because of the gas rate. In this way we can save alot of money. Gas has been really expensive and this case we can save money and cause less accidents.

Nobody is willing to keep driving to stay safe and save gas money. ""70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars and 57 percent sold their cars"". I think that limiting this car usage would be a good thing for all of us. We would just have to find a safer way to get transportation.

In other ways alot of people drive around drunk and they cause alot of car accidents. This is something that is not fair for us innocent drivers.

To begin with ,Paris has banned driving to smog (pollution towards the greenhouse).Contaminated air we breathe isn't good for are lungs-just are health period. Consuming to much carbon and make us very sick and ill. Somethings we need to get to are pretty far and to get to places on time is faster by car- which most people think but isn't the case. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Plug-in cars , hyrbrids , and or cars carrying three or more passengers would be good but what about are power plants , cant they be used for something else? Cars are a good tool to have but its causing problems in our greenhouse that we need to stop

Meanwhile in Bogota , car free day is going in a great path. Many of us been in traffic jams before,right? Sitting at a light 3 times before you get to go .Do you ever think walking would be faster ? On car free day in Bogota,Colombia Colombians didnt use there cars and didnt complain about it ; they used bikes,skates or skateboards , even took a bus! Now, thats sounds like some good resources to me. We all like good days and not stressed one so leave the car in your drive way and start using other things to get you to where you have to go. This could be a community thing to everyone aound you , every citie , and every state.

Limiting the usage of vehicles can asist society with forming a shift in American Behavior and safety.

Vehicle usage has taken a nose-dive in the past centry. From the loss of jobs, to the decrease in income, down to the death of thousands. Because of the health risk many places have set a ban on driving privlages such as Paris. According to the resource, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Oftenly, those who refused to respectfuly contribute to the ban were forced to pay a fine of $31.00 in United States money for not obeying the City's instructions. The pollution rate has slowly decreased as society continuously starts to decrease the mass usage of vehicles. As to sociologist, ""If the pattern persists- and many sociologist believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for cabon emissions and the enivronment..."" These implications have been studied by many to figure out the real reason car industires do not rebrand themselfs as ""mobility"". The companies that have taken the leap to stop pollution have allowed society to make a enormous U-turn in the way the government controls pollution evacuation.

The safety of society has also taken a major leap in success. Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University states """"Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"""". other ways, such as speaking to friends electronically can also have an impact of the car usage. Not meeting up with friends and wasting gasoline (or diesel fuel) is the most common way to stop pollution and its hazzardous complications. Also, ""With all these changes, people wo stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit...."" thus, causing a sudden shift in the way pollution is being created. Reflecting on other major causes of a global shift such as the nations popultion dencity.

We use cars for everything and the toxic gases release by cars are killing the Earth. This toxic gases are being release into the air we breath in. This gases are affecting us and the environment the animals live in, but is also affecting the Earth.

We depend on the Earth everyday, when we wake up we expect the sun to shine on our face and the plants expect the light from the sun to observe carbon dioxide and release oxygen, our major source of surviving. 12 percent  of greenhouse gas is due to passenger in Europe, but in the United States  it takes up to 50 percent in cars intensive. For example in Paris, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city from pollution.

Saving our planet is not difficult all you got to do is reduce pollution by recycling reusable things, use less energy in you home and use less water.

All of our devolpment since World War II has been centered on the car and that will have to change ,"" said David Golberg. Now this is true, cars have been a fluenctal idea  for  transportation. Cars is known to be the fastest way of transportatin, but maybe limiting car usage can be helpful. Theres thousands of alternatives like bicking, skating, running, ridding a bus, or even a train. limiting car usage would save the money you use on gas, reduce the ammount of polution in our atmosphere, and is more healthy for your body. Heres my explanation to why limiting car usage would be a productive idea.

Our nation spends millons on gas each week, limiting car usage would save that money. The amount of money people spend on gas is astonishing. Limiting car usage by taking a buss or even using a bike could save that money. In my community there is this parking lot for buss takers, this way people can save money on gas and still get to there destination on time. Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it will reduce polution.

Polution is a huge problem not just for Europe or North America, but for the entire world.

3BBE377B9C08,"Man conquered its environment with advancements and technology, they make life easier but some are harmful to our environment. Automobiles were derived from carriges but unlike carriges automobiles requiered some kind of power to run on. Most vehicles in modern day run on gasoline, Diesel, or electricity. They make transportation easier for us but like every good apple it has its rotten side. Fumes produced by the burning of Diesel and Gasoline are harmful to our ozone. The fumes produce a green-house like effect and trap in the heat contributing to global warming. Although Desiel engines have improved and are now cleaner our atmosphere is still taking a sucker punch. Almost every family in the United States owns an automobile, thats millions and millions of people driving increasing carbon emmisions. If less people used their personnal vehicle they could save money and diminish the amount of pollution produced by their automobiles. There is no way we can obliterate car use because we have built our world centered on car use but we don't have to stop driving we could simply reduce our impact by using public transportation, walking or riding a bicycle. Walking or driving a bicycle could relieve stress while commuting and traffic jams increase your stress level do something for yourself and our environment and decrease your stress level.

The are many many reasons to decrease our reliance on automobiles yet even with many benefits we refuse to do our part. The amount of fossil fuels available in earth is limited, in the past decades we have used much of it there will soon come a day when we will experience a shortage of fossil fuel. The day will come regardles of anything because of our relaince in this source of power but we can slow down its arrival by using less. Americans use thousands and thousands of dollars a year to fill up their tanks, when they could walk or car pool and save money. They could use that money to pay bills, make improvements in their home or make a college found for their kids. Yet many preffer to drive and just burn their money away. The use of public transportation doesn't only save you money it can increase your comminities economy.

While i'm all for saving money there is a greater cause then just saving money. Although is obvious we could all use a few extra bucks in our wallet we could also use a healthier planet. We breath in the fumes that automobiles produce, carbon is not good for us its a health hazard. We are polluting the air we breath our body needs oxygen not carbon and yet that's a high percentage of what our lungs inhale. There is also the concern that carbon emissions are causing holes in our ozone layer. The ozone protects us from all the harmful rays that the sun emmits like Uv-rays. There has been an increase of people sufferring from skin cancer in the last decade. why you may ask, well carbon emissions make holes in our ozone layer which in essance allows harmful sun rays to reach us. With a certain amount of exposure to radiation our cells experience mutations caused by the harmful rays and essancially give birth to cancer. Many people die because of this disease and we lament their loss but not enough to make a change. Pollution produced by automobiles has many negative effects on our environment, and health. We could decrease the damage by doing our part and leaving our car parked in the garage.

If saving money and having a cleaner environment isn't a good enough reason to limit you car usage then do for your own health. There is more to life then just driving impatienlty in a car you could walk and enjoy nature. Our reliance on cars is unhealthy for us and our environment. We are polluting our beautiful planet and causing an increase of health hazards. There is only so much fossil Fuel left we can waste it all at once or make it last a little longer. I myself enjoy the pleasure of just driving to a store rather than walking but i preffer a healthy environment over a car ride. Do your part walk, take a bus, or car pool with your friends.

FB2158B9C07C,"Many probelms that our world is facing right now are pointed back to car usage. Problems such as congestion, high levels of smog, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions in many places are all discussed in these articles.

These days people can't get see themselves going on with their life without a car but in places such as Bogota, Columbia they have a set date called ""The Day Without Cars"". The day without cars is a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.(paragraph 20) Many people in Bogota choose to hike, bike, skate or take buses in order to get to work or wherever else they need to be. Some Colombians even enjoy it, such as businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza who said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (paragraph 24)

In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" places such as Vauban, Germany are even giving up the usage of cars. Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"". (paragraph 2) A media trainer and mother of two in Vauban named Heidrun Walter described how the change to not using cars has affected her in a positive way when she said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" (paragraph 3) Experts say that automobiles have a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. (paragraph 5) When places like Vauban begin to reduce or completely end car usage, the greenhouse gas is also reduced and helps to reach the goal of a more healthy and clean society.

The article ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog,"" Talks about cities such as Paris that have tried to forcedly ban driving. The reason for doing this was in hope to ""clear the air of the global city."" (paragraph 10) Even though there were many who did not participate in the ban of cars in Paris, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. (paragraph 14) Not only did this effort of less car usgae reduce congestion but it also reduced the level of smog in the France.

For many people cars are just an excuse not to exercise. For example, someone might say ""Why should I walk when i can drive?"" or ""Why should I bike when I could take a taxi?"" People are so busy and caught up in work and being the best over everyone that exercise and physical condition are the least of their worries when really, it should be at the top of their list of importance. If someone decides to walk or skate to work everyday they would be in a healthy state of being and not have to worry or stress about finding extra time after work or school to exercise. If car usage is limited, our community would be drastically more healthy, physically and mentally.

The amount of car usage has a great affect on many things in our community and our world. Car usage affects not only the pollution in our living conditions but also our mood and for some people, their happiness and stress level. The limited amount of cars also forces us to seek different forms of transportation that are not all motorized. Without cars people sometimes choose to walk, bike, skate, or even run to where they need to be. Not only does this improve our pollution problem but it also improves our physical and mental health. Limited car usage has many advantages and could make a very positive impact on our world.                                            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B78CC05094A9,"There is a limit to car usage. A car can really come in handy but its not nessary. Gas is not all that cheap for evryone either. Cars don't need to be used for everyhting but since thats an easy way to get around people just take advantage of that and use it. People can cause lots of damage with the way they use there car. Weather people of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice ans schoolplaus remains an open question.

A car can really help you out in some cases. But it not nessary at all. There are lots of other things you can do to help help out. Their are things you can do to get you places and also helping you out. Example riding a bike, gets you to exercise and also take you places. Needing of a car isn't so needy anymore.""But america's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling.

people do can cause lots of damage with there vehicles. The amount of care people have with driving is rediculous. Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city. Their are sidewalks that have to be replaced,rush-hour restrictions that have dramatically cut traffic. All these can happen for careless people instead of following such simple things.

Not only do people use up gas in there car but also miles. The number of miles used in your vehicle does matter. The number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis. Means car usage is very high in the united states. My opinion cars are no nessasary for everything. There are more to use or do to get to places which may take longer or faster but still getting there.

Some advantages of limiting your car usage. Yes there are much limits to it which are important. People should really start using or finding other way to go.""Its's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"".    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
6CBF5570EF1D,"A ""car free"" community has many advantages. They will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases. They will also help you save more money by not having to pay for a car, and if you do, you can park it in a garage for $40,000. This will also expand other transportation and will have a new six-year federal transportation bill. There is no disadvantages for having a ""car-free"" community. Many countries and cities are participating in limiting car usage to make the air better and cleaner.

First, and most important, is that reducing cars also reduces the greenhouse gas emmision. People that participate in this are most likely doing it to make the air we breath better. In some over-populated cities, the amount of smog is crazy. After just one day without some cars, the amount of smog dissapeared. London had the idea for even-numbered license plates to be banned to drive one day, even though some people still used their cars. So more than half the cars are still on the road, and it reduced smog so much, they didn't even need to ban the odd numbered cars. This is the most important reason why people are limiting car usage.

Next, if you live in a car free community, you will never have to pay for your car. You can sell it to make more money becuase you will never have to use it. This is much better than owning a car and having to park it in a garage for $40,000. If you ever need to take the bus, you will have the money. With the extra money you can buy a bike also. The stores will be walking distances, so there is no need for a car. I think this is a great idea for not only a better community, but it would help people socialize with neighbors and it saves money while doing it. After World War II, the cities would start reconstructing around the car, but now that is beggining to change in Vauban, Germany.

Last, the cities are trying to expand public transportation, such as taxis and buses. It would promote these and play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have gone to highways by law and 20 percent have gone to other transportation. If the city bans cars, you can either walk, skate, bike, or ride the bus or taxi. In America, the amount of cars being bought and license plates being bought are decreasing since 1995. President Obama has an ambitious goal on which he unvieled last week and he wants to get rid of green house gas emmisions.

In conclusion, I think you would agree that limiting car usage has its advantages. It reduces greenhouse gases and also smog. After one day, Paris was clear of gas and smog in the air. The gas gets caught under the atmosphere and is dangerous. Limiting car usage also will help you save money because you no longer will have a car to pay for. Also, it would boost other forms of transportation, such as buses and taxis. This is a great idea to limit cars.         ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
EFEC1137E151,"Auto-mobiles have been used as the average use of transpotation ever since the

Was there any other reason to use anything other than a car after that, no not really but now there are. After so many decades there arrives three valid reasons to limit the average joes use of their motor vehicle. One, you can reduce the smog build up in your cities, two; as well as smog greenhouse gases heavy up on areas in the Earths atmosphere but can be helped, three; people use public transportaion more as well as riding their bikes and walking. if you can limit your selves on car use, you can create a better tomorow.

First off, reducing smog in your area. smog is generated out of the tail pipes of motor vehicles and is bad for the enviroment and atmosphere. with limiting your daily car commute you can remove a good part from your area. when Paris had ordered that only plates that only odd number plates could drive on the roads on monday their large smog cloud of 147 micrograms of PM per cubic meter smog was greatly reduce and lifted the following day. so just one day of cutting the daily car commute in half a city as big as Paris was able to lift a smog.

moving along, the green house gases. Green house gases a like smog is a by product of driving your every day car to and fro work. green house gases are dangeours chemical gases that eat away at earths Ozone layer letting in UV rays that can be very harmful to you and the rest of the ecosystem. Bogata recently had a car free day in which no one was allowed to drive motor vehicles except for buses and taxis. their goal was to promote alternative uses of transportation as well as lowering the amount of green house gases let into Earths atmosphere. doing something like what bogata can help cut down on all the harsh chemicals being let off into the atmosphere.

lastly, finding other sources of transportaion other than every day car. finding another way of getting around is great for the community, it keeps you healthy and the earth healthy. Vauban germany is actually a car free city, it does not have roads on which you can drive upon but only a main street. everything that is needed in the town is no longer a car ride away but a bike ride away or a walk down the road resulting in a very community both people and ecosystem. as well as that is also saves people money not haveing to buy or a car for that matter. now think on how it would be like if your city did this and how much it would benefir from it.

In conclusion, having a car free day or banning about half the cars from driving on one day is not a bad thing but instead a good thing. once again you can reduce the smog, you ca even help keep green house gases out of the atmosphere, and for the last time find other healthier ways of getting around. so to ask the simple question why would you not limit your everyday car use.

A7D201133DAD,"Limiting your car usage has benifits to yourself, the community and the environment. In these aricles there's examples of way communities have given up ther cars and how car usage has gone down over the years.

In Vauban, Germany residents have given up their cars. In this expeirimental community, street parking, driveways, and garages are almost forbidden. Car ownership is however allowed, but the only place to park are large garages at the edge of the development. If you own a car and decide to park there, you must buy a space for $40,000, plus a home! The outcome of this has been most of the community don't own cars. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" this was said by Heidrun Walter, mother of two and a media trainer. Also this communities idea has been adopted around the world.

An effect of extreme car ususe can be smog. Paris, France has the most smog out of all the other European capitals. They had ""147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london, Reuters found."" After days of heavy pollution. A partial driving ban was enforced to clear the city's air. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home. If they didn't do so, they would be charged with a 22-euro fine. The same order wouls be given to odd-numbered plates the next day. Almost 4,000 driver's cars were fined for using their cars.

In Bogota, Colombia they set up a program, The day without cars it's when cars are banned and only buses and taxis are permitted. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" stated by Carlos Arturo Plaza a businessman. The day without cars is part of an improvment campaign that began in bogota in the mid-1990's. during this year's anual day without cars, authorities from others countries have can to see the event and were very pleased by it. "" These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"" said by Enrique Riera, the major of Asunci`on, Paraguay.

In recent studies it's shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, getting less lincenses, and driving less as each year goes by. Many beleive America's love for cars is deteriorating. The number of miles driven has gone down since 2005. Some think it's because we simpliy can't afford new cars.""A study last year found driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" Even the number of cars per home has gone down. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn"" said by Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. If this patterns persists it will be very benificial to the environment. Mimi Sheller, a sociology professer at Drexel University thinks the internet makes people feel more connected, therefore we don't feel the need to drive out and meet friends.

In conclusion, limiting your car usage benifits you and the environment. As quoted in the essay people express how they feel less stressed from not using their cars. Countries and communities around the world are taking part in less car usage and feeling great from it. So i advise you do the same and help yourself and the environment.

5B1654AEA34D,"When you lower the usage of cars in a certain area, you could see many benefits. Remember when you would hear occassionally that pollution in certain areas are affecting the world. And is it sort of worrying that you might be in one of those cities? Well, one of the main contributors is cars. Driving around, dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Swiping its claws at the Ozone layer. Many countries have suffered this pollution the hard way. As in France, they had to ban certain cars after every few days or so. Because the Smog in there was so dense. The pollution could have been very harmful if not given the right precautions. Scary right? Thats why citys like Vauban, Germany have noticed these facts and are now trying out some very ""Eco friendly"" solutions to help. They simply didnt use cars. They resident of the area knew of the danger and gave up their cars for the greater good. And it worked. The city was and still is very clean. And peacful without the very few sounds of motor cars from a distance away. A few city caught on to this, as they are also worried about pollution engulfing their atmosphere. So a few other city like Bogota, Columbia. Have made a car-free day in which the only means of transportation was a: Bus, foot, or bike. Which lowered the number of people you would see on the street. It was a big success in Bogota. But few other countries have caught on to this. Like Beijing, China. The most polluted city on earth, is like a giant vortex of smog and trash. They didn't notice yet. And might be one of the few city that find out the hard way when you keep putting smoke in Mother natures face. But our country, America. Is finding out the safe way to travel with less pollutant use. We are trying new and better means of transportation. As in Biking, Carpooling. Or just walking if the distance isn't that tough. Fewer teens these days could honostly couldnt care less about a drivers license. Now they just carpool with other friends or take public transportation. The percentage of peak drivers have descresed to a percentage that of which was around 1995. These pieces of evidence tell us that we can make this world a better place, for the good. Its just a simple step to a bigger door. To where we actually don't have to worry about global warming, or pollution in certain countries. We should just live peaceful lives. And not about whats gonna happen first. Vauban, Bogota, Paris, Asuncion Paraguay. And small parts of the United States have thought about this. When will the rest of us get the picture? Limiting car usage is very vital to pollution and will kick it down a notch. And we could wake up in the morning to see a beautiful glimering sky. Shining its blue flourescent light back at you. Not a giant billowing ball of black smoke that will cover your sky. Turning it into a Gloomy, dull patch of depression on your day. That is why you have to lower your car usage every now and then. Or else, it could end up like that. It might end up as in you make the decision. Or your peers make the decision. You really should consider the darger of what might await you when you step into your car.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
99EB08860D55,"I think people should stop relying on their cars so much for three reasons. I hope this can change peoples minds about using the vehicles for everything. Even going to the corner of their block just for a bite they use their cars.

The opening reason why I think people should really limit their car usages is that it causes less pollution in the atmosphere. If drives don't give a limit to their uses of their cars we might end up having global warming. That's not gonna be great. For example before when cars were rarely seen we had no global warming problem, but now that cars are seen all over the places, global warming is near of arrival.

The following reason why I think people should put a limit to their car usage is that it would benefit everyone because there will be less traffic. Having no traffic at all is a common dream for many drivers that drive to work using the expressway every morning. Unfortunely people have to be stuck in traffic everyday because they don't want to let go of their cars. They should experiment other ways to get to work or to even the corner of their block. They should try bike riding to their destations. That's double the benefit. They get to excercise their bodies and not damage the environment with deadly gases that can cause global warming. In the second source by Robert Duffer he states that ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"".

My next reason why I think drivers should limit their car usues is because they are basically killing themselves with fatal accidents almost everyday. There's a lot of causes for fatal accidents, one of them is texting and driving. That's the main cause of fatal car accidents. Drunk driving is at close second. None the less, if people would just pay attention while they are driving there would be less car accidents, or even better they stop using their cars as often to avoid car accidents. Even when knowone is distracted while driving there are still a few car accidents. Most of the time that's just a regular accident with knowone losing their lives, but it happens many tims because the streets are so compacted with drivers eager to move. That's why I think people should stop relying on their cars so heavily. To decrease the death rate to a  normal level.

In conclusion, all these three reasons why I think people should limit the usage of their vehicles are the reasons why the world isn't at it's normal levels of natural events in traffic. If citizens would rely less on their vehicles, we would see a change in the air we breathe and less chances of having global warming, less traffic in city streets, and less fatal car accidents with less people being killed.                        ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
4B93BC8CBC5B,"In a society where things are always changing and schedules are always busy, cars and other personal motor vehicles have become a necessity. It seems as if cars have become a necessary mean for survival, rendering as important as something imparative like oxygen or water. Many families even have multiple cars in order to get to where the need to go. Even though cars have been so convienient and beneficial for people all over the world, there are some factors of cars that produce a negative effect. By eliminating or largly reducing car usage, the world would be more safe, more eco-friendly, and save the precious natural gases that the Earth provides.

For years people have been driving, and while most do it safetly, some do it recklessly and do not abide by the rules, sometimes leading to fatal outcomes. Reckless driving, careless driving, and driving under the influence has become one of the leading causes of death among young people, making many very skeptical or cautious about driving. Millions of people are lost each year in car accidents, leaving behind family members and loved ones to grieve in their place. If cars were to be elimated from the equation, all of these deaths could easily be avoided. By walking, riding bicycles, taking the bus or subway, or even a trolly or ferry, there will be an ensured reduction of accidents and an increase in safety and peace of mind.

In additon to increased safety, there would also be a significant reduction in the emissons of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases and smog have been polluting the atmosphere especially since the coming about of cars. It says in source four that transportation produces half of America's carbon emission. If car usage were to be limited or eliminated, there would be a noticable and significant decrease in the amount of carbon emissions in the air. Similarly, source one states that, "" Passanger cars are responsible for 12 pecent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" If cars were to be ridden of, there would be much less green house gas poluting the atmosphere, therefore creating a cleaner environment and a brighter and longer future for the generations to come.

Similarly, the removal of cars from the world would mean the preservation of nonrenewable resources. Since cars run on gasoline, diesel, and other natural gases, the resources are being burned up faster than they can replenish themselves. There are other things that rely on the natural gases to work, cars included. If cars were to be eliminated, and not use the gases at the rapid rate that they do, there would be a huge reduction in the usage for fossil fuels, therefore preserving the remaining resources and only using them when mandatory. This would allow the natural gases to slowly increase and be able for use in the future.

In conclusion, the limitations of car usage would make a significant change in the way the world runs, however there would be many positive outcomes to it. Not only would it ensure a brighter, longer, and more promising future for the coming generations, but it would also relieve stress and worrying and grant peace of mind to many. Although there is no way to take back the damage already done to the Earth, this would greatly reduce the potential damage that could be done, and protect the future. It would provide oppurtunities for a a cleaner atmosphere, safer life, living in harmony with the ecosystem, and a chance to respect and protect the Earth we live on.

457BDFC312A8,"Based on the four sources, car usage should be limited in some way. Smog in Paris and other cities have governments placing restrictions on when and where citizens are allowed to drive their vehicles. A German has a certain city that bans cars and other places, such as Bogota, Columbia, have ""car free days"". These give citizens of nearly every country a thought of why drive when i can walk. Some expert sociologists even believe we are out of our peak car buying years and into one that is less vehicle extemsive and more stress free and relaxed.

In Paris, smog forced many citizens to stop their driving all together. The pollution was so overwhelming that it rivaled Beijing, one of the most polluted cities on the world (Duffer). Car emissions put Paris' parculate matter scale off of the charts. Pullotion is a serious issue, especially when it affects millions, such as those in Paris. Other places have gone so extreme to ban cars in certain cities. Vauban, Germany have given up their cars to live there. Most citizens agree with Heidrum Walter's words of ""being much happier [without a car]"" (Rosenthal). Her understanding of a life without a vehicle is a crutial turning point in todays society and even limit air pollutions, not unlike those of Paris or Bejing.

Experts say that the United States ""love affair for vehicles seems to be cooling"" (Rosenthal). Many Young citizens aged under 25 seem to have no desire for a drivers license. As of April 13, 2013, the number of miles driven per person were down 9 percent from the peak of car buying sales. We are experiencing a long term cultural shift (Rosenthal) and will likely see dramtic changes in the future. Major cities , like New York and San Fransico, have transit and subway systems put into place for this very reason. More car pooling and public transit seems to be the way to go.

Not only does driving less reduce air pollution, but it decreases unwanted stress in many different situations. Many cities and countries around the globe agree with this and are all headed that direction. Vehicles seem do be on the downhill portion pf their lifespan. Take the initiative and protect our world. Less driving and less pollution reduces stress in even the best of us.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
C695BEF42436,"As of April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was down 9 percent. So that means people are starting not to drive as much, which is not a bad thing. Actually they're many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can actually help the environment, help the emissions, and if we do limit car usage it can make cities denser as well as having some places that don't use cars. Which will be good for the world.

Transportation is really big in America. People drive all the time, were a moving country. So driving and using cars does effect our enviornment. One big thing going on is smog. One country that i can point out is Paris. Paris had so much smog that they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" according to the article Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer. Paris has more smog than other european capitals. Which is really bad because that can effect us as humans. In Bogota They are doing a program that involves banning cars for a day. The goal was to promote transportation and reduce smog which it did. So limiting car usage can improve safety and make the environment more clean.

Limiting car usage can also have beneficial implications for carbon emissions. If we created cities with pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, it can lower emissions and if the emissions are in good care then the environment will be to, ""since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" President Obama has goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions. Experts say"" Is a huge impediment to current eforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes..."" according to the article In German suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, by Elisabeth Rosenthal she says"" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United states. So thats pretty bad so if we limit car usage we can help fix that and maybe even have a lower percentage on emissions.

Vauban home to 5,500 residents are really taking limitation to cars serious. They may be the most advanced experiement in low-car suburban life. But they are doing really good. Other countries around the world are adopting what they are doing in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible, which is a good thing. Espescially for people that dont use cars, and especially if your trying to make the air more cleaner. According to In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, ""Vauban, copleted in 2006 is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "" Smart planing""."" This is a advantage for the world because we need to have someplaces that actually dont use cars. Also Vauban can inspire other countries to do the same. Which will be a advantage.

So they're are many advantages for limiting car usage. A lot has to do with the environment like it reduces smog and helps emissions which will be better for the world. The biggest advantage for limitation on car usage is pretty much a better world and who wouldnt want to live in a better world. It can also help other places be like Vauban. They don't use cars as much and it works for them, and a lot of people should start doing that. These advantages will really help the world if we do decide to ever limit car usage.                        ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

B2343ABCE020,"If we limit car usage there would be less pollution, we would save thousands of dollars, and it would inprove our safety. So if you really think about it, less usage of cars would be a great impact for us in a good sense.

For starters, experts say we have to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes..passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the U.S. Our planet is already polluted enough..why add more to it. For example; diesel trucks make up 67% of vechicles in France..which then adds more smog. In addition, Paris has more smog than othe European capitals. Once Paris had 147 microgrmas of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found. In the city of Bagota, Colombia their goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, violaters faced a $25 fine.

Futhermore, not only would there be less pollution..but we would save thousands of dollars..on gas and insurance. Gas is one of the most important things for a car, it makes it function. But also we would be fine if we didnt have it, mainly because we would save hundreds of dollars a month. The average cost for a gallon of gas is $3.70. Not only gas but insurance and repair jobs. Insurance is as expensive as it is when you wreck your car, if you're lucky enough your insurance could possibly pay for it depending whos fault it was who caused the accident.

In conclusion, at the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, excutive chairman of the Ford motor Company..laid out a bussiness plan, he proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in pedestrian, bicycles, public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emmisions and impove safety. So therefore safety is the #1 for most companies.

To sum things up we would have less pollution, save money, and our safety would be guarented. Those are the great advanatges of having our usage of cars be limited.                                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

many other advatanges of limiting car usage is the decrease of car crashes. causing insurance rates and prices to go down. also causing the limiting of teen drivers and very old people to drive as much. car crashes in america increase rapidly on a daily bases. meaning that there will be the cause of more deaths, hospital bills, and insurance will go up. less car usage less bills, money to reapair uneeded things. dont get me wrong cars are creat, cars changed this whole world on a new way to transport with its new accessories and gagets. but also limiting that car companies dont have to spend a whole lot to be in det. cars are something out of this world people still wonder on the functions of how it works. but sometimes its better to keep that way not knowing how and not using it as much. limiting car usage is a good idea but also it can cause alot of damage on what job, and also what the person uses the car for his or her natural habitat of the usage of the car.

16DF5181A5C3,"Cars have been the main focus of developement for many years now. Engineers attempt to create sufficient cars every time a new model is planned. Many citizens of the United States are slightly aware of the environmental damage that is caused by the cars, yet still do no think twice when it comes to driving anywhere. Many countries around the world have set fines and laws against using cars and have seemed to produce a positive outcome. These countries offer many different alternatives to using cars, creating a well developed society.

While cars are a huge advantage to modern day society, they take a big toll on our environment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the

New York Times

Company, cars are the ""second largest source of America's emission"" proving how much we rely on cars (source 4 paragraph 34).She also writes about numbers terrifying to the future generations. United States is responsible for 50 percent greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes while Europe is only responsible for 12(source 1 paragraph 5). 50 percent is proof that Americans are too reliable on transportation sources like streets, main roads, and highways. Paris was able to clear the air from pollution. According to Robert Duffer from the

Chicago Tribune ,after enforcing a driving ban, the air cleared after an almost record setting pollution fog (source 2 paragraph 10). Places in Asia like Beijing, China are just filled with smog in the air. The citizens walk around with masks because of the heavy pollution. That is physically dangerous for not only the adults, but the children of the communities. There has to be some alternatives to using cars in excess. Almost anything can be an advantage but when it is used too much, it will always be dangerous.

Even though cars are important to commerce within society, many alternatives can be taken to help lower the usage of cars. In places like the capital of Columbia, they have found a way to travel places and limit the car use. Andrew Selsky, from the

Seattle Times , speaks of this matter. He claims that there has been ""construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" in the city of Bogota (source 3 paragraph 27). Not only does this allow the citizens to be environmentally friendly, but it gives them a chance to exercise, which leads to better health. It is noticable the the healthier people tend to be more lifting than the sluggish, corpulent citizens. In Barcelona, Spain, being a vehicle owner is simple undesired. Other means of transportation like walking or bycycling have been the desired means of getting places. Even Bill Ford, the chairman of Ford Motor Company, admits to the impractical use of cars in excess. There are some many different ways the we can reduce the use of Cars in the American nation.

With the ability of using bikes to arrive at destinations, many places have seen the improvements in reduced traffic jams. What Americans hate the most are traffic jams. Think about those times when 10 minutes have slipped away in the morning and you are running late then there is a traffic jam. Millions in Columbia participated in hiking or biking and it left the street nearly empty (source 3 paragraph 20). The citizens were smart enough to recognize when they need a car. When going to work that is only 5 miles away, they take the extra time to reduce the usage of the streets. France experienced the same result, reducing traffic congestion by 60 percent, and then lowering the smog that had covered them (source 2 paragraph 14). This leaves the street safer for drivers and pedestrians. It also reduces the heavy noise from motored vehicles.

Many nations have improved their societies by reducing the use of cars. In result, the air pollution is reduced, the health benefits improve, and the traffic congestion is heavily reduced. Not only can reducing our relience on cars benefit our genertaion, but it can benefit the generations to come.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Residents saying that they find that there are many advantages to not owning a car. Such as reducing the gas emissions from tailpipes, saving money, and being much happier.

For instance, an advantage of not having a car is a decrease in gas emission. In the article ""Car Free Cities""  its sites ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the United Stated."" This shows that cars are infecting our greenhouses with gases and potentionaly harming us.

Furthermore, not owning a car will save you money. In the article it states ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" That statement shows that it's not really reasonable to own a car when you have to pay to park.

Lastly, people in the article say they are much happier after they sold thier car to live there. There a woman named Heidrun Walter who says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" this statement shows that residents of Vauban like separating suburban life from auto use.

To conclude, there are many reasons why the residents of Vauban, Germany have given up there cars. They benefit from many advantages such as reduced gas emissions, saving money, and being much happier in their life. in the end there many advantages to living in Vauban.

0F2FF9C6091C,"Did you know that car ownership is the number one cause of death in the united states? I hope you don't, because that isn't true. However, there still are some benifits to letting go of the wheel. Eveyone knows how much damage cars can do and have done with the energy they release into the Ozone, but it's not a lost cause. Research shows that if we all stopped using auto-mobiles, then overtime the Ozone layer could vastly improve. True, not all the damage can be reversed, but a lot is better than nothing.

Also, the number of car usage per person in the united states is drastically dropping already, so you might as well get ahead instead of getting behind. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005, and began to steadily decline thereafter. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was almost 9% below what the country was in January of 1995. These statistics are still moving further down their respective directions to this day, so it would be wise to be prepared.

Traffic acidents are one of the biggest causes of death in America, and how can we fix that? Well, no traffic would be a nice start. I mean, this one is just common sense. You can't be in a car crash without cars. If we completley got rid of car travel, THOUSANDS of lives would be preserved annually. It's a simple solution to a major problem, and just maybe could be the biggest advantage of limiting auto-mobile usage not just in the United States of America, but all across the globe.

Cars and other auto-mobiles have become an established part of our culture, and have been for generations, but just because something has been established for a while, that does not mean it is going to need to stay forever. Several places have aleady began car-usage limitation, most notably Vauban, Germany. I feel there are several benifits to it, some that are life saving, so I see no harm in at least giving it a chance in certain areas.                                                            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

4C4544BE2EBD,"Cars are a very large help for transportation. Although they do have alot of defects to our environment, our laziness, and our safety.

The first reason we should limit car use is so our environment doesn't get ruined.  The fumes our vehicles are relasing into the air are creating a large addition to the greeenhouse gases.  For an example semis, diesel cars, diesel trucks and other vehicles when you rev the gas it pours out black smoke into the environment.  When you see a truck do this you think nothing of it, but overtime and with every single car and truck that does it, it adds up very quickley.

Another reason we should limit our car usuage is because it increases our laziness.  Instead of driving to school when it's only 2 minutes away, you could just walk.  If you walked you would lose a little weight and even saving your gas money.  If you are close to the place you want to go then you might as well just walk in benfits you in many ways.  Saving money, losing weight, and getting more fit.

One of the most important reasons we should limit our car usuage is for our own safety.  Deaths in car accidents is one of the most leading causes to death now a days. would you rather walk or ride a bike to the location you want to go or would you rather risk your life by driving and somebody teboning you and injuring or even killing you.  Not that you should but some people sometimes can get into a crash with you and then just drive off. Whether it was your fault or theirs now you have to pay for the damages done to your vehicle.

If you are going to drive because you live far away from everything.  Simply car pull, it's alot easier and if everyone throws down a little money then you aren't spending that much on gas or diesel.  Riding a bike is a great solution to limiting car usuage because it's a one time purchase, once you buy the bike you don't have to pay for fuel.  Also it's better than walking because it's by far faster.

In general driving has advantages and disadvantages.  Although if you are close to your location then riding a bike would be ideal to lower car usuage.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Well ther are some causes of the use of car which is polllution. like it says in the passage, ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower pollution"" (source 3). Pollution can be really bad for the people. "" The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violateros wil be fine twenty five dollars"" (source 3). In bogota they have had a change with limiting car usage. ""It was third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of seven million"" (source 3).

People have been affected by this cause. Bogota has inpired many others to do this. Two Colombian cities has joine with them , Cali, and Valledupar. Bogota are ""generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"" (source 3). Bogota just had one thing on their mind, which was to reduce smog. Ther are many other places with this king of cause. Paris has been the one most affected. "" Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"" ( source 2). There has been four thousand drivers fined, and twenty seven had their car impounded for their reaction  of the fine. "" After days of near-recorded pollution, Paris enfourced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" (source 2).

The United States has been doing some reserach and turns out that, "" Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The United States has been "" one of the worls prime car cultures"" (source 4). The united states have had the highest population growth of mile driven in two-thousand five and dropped down afterwards. The miles driven was nine percent lower than it was in two-thousand five. Car pullution has been affectig people. This is why they are reducing car usage. Its for their own good.

Pollution has been stopped with limiting the use of cars. People have been riding bikes, walking, etc, to places they have to go. They have sacrificed the use of car but has advanced their lifestyle. The have made a commitment to decrease the population of pollution. There have been talks to start inventing plug-in-cars, hybrids, and car carrying three or more passengers. There are going to find a way to stop pollution.

Car companies seem to be losing business also. With more and more drives becoming pedestrians each day, it seems that private automobiles will soon be replaced by the old method of transportation, walking. This new option of transportation seems to be becoming a trend everywhere.

Less cars means less polution. Major cities that are filled with cars seem be becoming more and more polluted each day. Big cities such as paris have taken major action, such as to temporarily ban driving, to reduce smog production. An article from the Chicago Tribune states""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(10). Pollution is becoming a big problem all over the world. Alternative transportation is one way you can help stop the pollution all over the world.

More exercise is allowed without cars. Withour cars, people are forced to get up and move to their destination instead of just sitting down your whole life. Obesity is becoming a big problem now all over the world but it has a very big impact in America. More people need more exercise and getting rid of cars is an excellent solution. Even with riding a bus, you would have to get up and walk to the bus stop. Alternative transportation could be the new big thing in exercise.

You can save money without a car. Due to inflation, cars cost a ludacris amount of money in modern day. People spend their whole lives trying to pay off an automobile. Not only do you have to pay off the Automobile itself but you must also pay for the gas, parts, and tools that come with it, which price continues to rise. It is also getting harder to find money and jobs as unemployement also rises while many salaries fall. It is very important to save your money and current day and maybe spend it on something more useful than an automobile.

As automobiles begin to become scarce among many counties, more and more benefits come with alternative transportation. The benefits of being able to save money, the ability to get in physical shape and to exercise more, and the ability to be smog free are all extremeley important in today's society and enviornment. Automobile businesses are even thinking of partnering with other companies that produce products such as bikes, busses, or even making more sidewalks for pedestrians with alternative transportation.

Also cars were affecting France by letting out to much smog. Cold nights and warm days had affected the warmer layer of air to trap emissions. If you limit car usage then you wouldn't have that problem.

Another advantage would be that you wouldn't be Inhaling as much polluted air If cars were limited. Polluted air Isn't good to Inhale and also will mess with people allergies so that would definitely be a big advantage. If car usage Is limited, more people would be active. That would help with people's health and decrease the number of lazy people we have In this world.

Limiting car usage would also help you save money by not having to repair your car. You won't have to take It to get checked by a mechanic every three months.

A41F1E76EE8E,"Limiting car usage is both safer and reduces the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If more people decide to walk and bike the amount of smog in the area will decrease tremendously. Also by not using your car as much you can save money on gas to put towards other things.

By limiting car use it will greatly reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the air. In Paris the congestion went down 60 percent after the partial driving ban. Passenger cars are account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent is some places in the United States. Just by walking to work every other day or carpooling you can greatly reduce the amount of emission put out from your vehicle.

If there are less cars then the parking lots will be made smaller which allows more room for stores. Instead of having to drive five or ten miles to the nearest store it would be placed just a walk away. In Bogota, Columbia where they have the car-free day more parks and sports centershave popped up. There are new restaurants and shopping districts within walking distance to where people there live.

Around the world, projects and programs have been started to test the effects of limited car use. Data has proved that limiting car usage will cause less pollution, less stress, and less traffic.

To begin with, gas released from our cars has slowly started to hurt us. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""(source 2). This shows that the gas in our cars is one of the factors responsible for the growing pollution in our air. Reducing the usage of cars will not only benefit us, but also the world we live in.

In addition, almost everyone knows what it is like to be stuck in traffic. The stress inducing event must not be healthy either. By declining the use of cars, congestion will slowly diminish. Promoting other ways of transportation will improve health, mood, and traffic. ""rush-hour restrictions have dramtically cut traffic;""(source 3).

Furthermore, a large portion of our population are constantly stressed. Car usage is accountable for a good amount of it. ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (source 1) says a citizen of a ""car-free"" community. By limiting car usage, healthier ways of transportation are encouraged. For example, hiking, biking, skating, and walking. All of these are extremely healthy compared to sitting in a car. Due to the fact that the United States is the country with the fattest people, these methods should be enforced. Healthy people then start to become happier.

With many people coming to a realization that private transportation may not be the best option for travel, it is hard to deny. There are already developed places in the world experimenting with the abscence of cars in their society.

Vauban, Germany is one of those places. Vauban residents have undertaken the task of turning their streets completely car-free, and it's working. The residents of the district even claim to enjoy a community without automobiles more, people claim to be less tense and happier without owning a car. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, those who do live in areas dedicated to large garages at the edge of the development that car owners but for $40,000, along with a home. While efforts in the past to making cities denser have given people a better reason to walk, it hasn't gone away at all, people are still driving everywhere they go. In the United States car reduced communities are being promoted by the Enviornmental Protecetion Agency, and legislators are starting to act on this. Public transport serving suburbs will play a much larger role in a new federal transportation bill being approved this year.

Vauban is not the only place with that has experimenting with banning private transportation, Paris has banned driving due to smog after days of near-record pollution to clear the air of the city. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, one of the most poluted cities in the world. People blamed diesel fuel because of a French tax policy favors diesel over gasoline, diesel makes up 67 percent of cehicles in France. Paris has more smog than other European capitals, many companies complained of lost revenue, but exceptions were made to allown plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was also free of charge Friday to Monday. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ban on odd-numbered plates to be lifted.

Bogota, Columbia is also doing their part in attempting to reduce the amount of automobiles used in society, car-free day has been in effect for three years in Bogota. With a large turnout, the streets were free of traffic jams as millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, and took buses to work. People comment how it is a great opportunity to redice stress and air polution in Columbia.

Cars require alot of payments such as monthly payments, repairs, upkeep, and gas. If people started taking the bus or riding a bike then our enconomy would be on its way to improving with all the money people would save.

Smog is a big problem in countries around the world. And helping our environment is a pretty good reason to limit car use. Smog is not something we need to worry about in most of America, although the fumes released from cars do damage the ozone layer of our atmosphere. The sun releases solar flares from its surface and these solar flares hit our atmosphere. Fortunately it is strong enough to withstand the hits. But our atmosphere is weakening with all the fumes trapped inside eating it away from the inside and these solar flares could do alot of damage if they get through. Smog, like i mentioned earlier, is a big problem in places like Italy and Asia. This is because of constant fumes being pumped out of cars and factories. We are lucky that our environmental cnditions dont allow this to happen but the fumes are damagig our atmosphere and it needs to be stopped or at least reduced. If we keep going on this track we're heading on then we may not have breathable air or a livable environment in the future.

To commence, reduction of car use will reduce pollution. Pollution is essentially hurting the planet as a whole, as well as all the organisms living in it. In fact, Paris, France, has recently taken action against car use effectively. According to Robert Duffer, ""[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""

The New York Times

's article, ""The End of Car Culture,"" ""transportaion is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" This is largely due to car culture in the U.S, which is fortunately declining. In fact, in the same article, it is said ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" This shows that America is well on it's way to becoming a greener nation without having to make dramatic changes to it's way of life.

Continuing, more limited car use can better society, or at least work in a community. Society is currently too dependant on cars. However, Vauban, Germany is starting to change that. In another

New York Times article, Elisabeth Rosenthal states, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" The remaining thirty percent of people hardly use their own cars for anything more than distant traveling, as most of Vauban's streets are ""car-free.""

In another case, in Bogota, Columbia, there is a designated holiday to celebrate not using cars. Appropriately titled, ""Day Without Cars"" is an annual event held in order ""to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog,"" according to the

Seattle Times's

Andrew Selsky. While it may sound silly, the event had a huge turnout in spite of bad weather. Other cities joined into the fun after a few years, and also in the article, Enrique Riera, the mayor of a Paraguay town, said of the event, ""'These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.'"" The simple effort to better the world has brought people together for a good cause.

In retrospect, the idea of declining the use of cars will help humanity as a whole greatly. Doing so would simultaneously slow down the destruction of the Earth for all organisms inside of it, and also help the human race better itself socially.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B0FC895D460A,"Having a car is a pain, you have to worry about every littile thing. Cars are not good for the environment, the pollution from the cars is destorying everything. That is why people are limiting their usage of the cars. I am going to tell the advantages of limiting your car usage.

In paris they banned people from driving their cars because of the smog. They enforced this ban to clear the air of the global city. They alos said if anyone is driving they would have to pay a fin of 22-euro which is 31 dollors. The smog cleared enough on monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban.

Since some people have stopped driving thie cars construction on bike paths. People in colombia have huiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. This has help prevent trafic lams, and brough down pollution. This is to help promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.

In bogot the rain hasn't stoped people from limiting their car usage. Limiting car usage is a great opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. For the frist time two more colombian cities cali and valledupar joined the event. They are starting a revolutionary change and is crossing borders.

The limiting of car usage is helping the pollution problem alot. People are also going on hikes, bike rides, skating to work to help. The day without cars is improvement campaign that began in the mid-1990s. The car limiting usage is a really good thing that we are doing. This is just what  we need to help get rid of pollution in the world and keep it save.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
760272F05BCE,"Now a days you see everyone with cars driving to places instead of walking. There are some small towns that cars are not needed because everything is so close but other cities everyone has to drive because everything is very distant from one another. Cars are needed on a daily basis to get to school, or to get to their job but walking or even biking would be a great idea because you would not be poluting the environment there would be less traffic jams and it would reduce the greenhouse gas. Limiting car usage would be a great idea and it would make peoples life a lot better and healthier because instead of driving they would walk to take a bike.

Polution is a big problem especially in big cities because everyone is driving and the smoke the cars leave makes our environment gross. Polution is not only because of the smoke the cars produce, it can also be when someone throws plastic into the oceans and poluting the waters or having trash in parks without recycling. I think we should re-enforce the recycling systems because many people dont know the benefits to that and how better our community and even world could be. When your are driving a car and especially in big cities like New York you need a car everywhere or just take the taxi. But just taking the taxi it wont reduce the probablity of polluting the air, it will still have the same effect as if you were driving your own car. If people would just walk or bike to their job or to their school poluting the air would not be a problem just like stated in source 2. In source 2 it talks about how in Paris they would fine the people up to 31 dollars.

There would also be less traffic jams due to the limiting of car usage just like stated in Source 3. In source 3 it talks about how in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that the colombians would ride their bike skate or take the bus and there would be less traffic jams. That is a very good idea because no one likes to be stuck in traffic especially if your in a hurry to get to work or even school. Traffic jams occur because of so many cars on the road. There is a thing called Rush hour and that is when everyone is leaving their work or school and they are going home and that is when everyone is on the road and thats when their is the most traffic. But it would be much easier if you would just bike or walk or take a bus and tried to avoid all of those traffic jams. The program that Bogota, Colombia has created is something that should be done nationwide because it would help so many other countries. Thanks to that programm people would go to the park and do sports and take walks.

Source A talks about the Greenhouse gas and how in Vauban,Germany soccer moms gave up their cars and how the streets were "" Car Free"". That led to having 70 percent of the families in Vauban to not having  cars and 57 percent of the people that moved to Vauban to sell their cars. According to this source a person said they are much happier not owning or having a car because when Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother had a car she said she was more tense. Apperently this movement was called "" Smart Planning"".

Limiting car usage would be a great benefit to people and a great idea to improve Earth. Pollution like mentioned before is one of the biggest problems we have and in big cities is an evern bigger problem. Traffic jams is something that will be hard to stop because everyone is using cars and will continue to use cars because it seems like thats the fastest way to get to your location but thats not accurate because if people think that way then thats the cause of traffic jams and thats the cause of the Rush hour. The movement in Vauban, Germany is something that people should do. Im not saying sell your car but to reduce the car usage is something that would be very helpful not only to you, but for the environment.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A6F6CE8D8725,"Our population is booming and with it, our car industry. Cars have provided us with mulitple pros for example, getting us places more quickly, and transportation of goods and services is more efficient. We have to know though that with every good follows a bad, and our beloved cars might not be as great as we belive them to be! Pollution from cars has affected our enviornment severley, we have thousands of accidents daily, and we are stressed due to traffic congestion and daily driving. So, limitting car usuage could provide us with many advantages because our enviornment will not nearly be as polluted, and we will be less stresssed out.

Our enviornment has been infected with toxic greenhouse gasses, and carbon emmisions which comes from our cars' tailpipes. Mixed with rain, the pollution causes a heavy smog making it nearly impossible for people to even see what is right in front of them making it very dangerous. We are now forced to hold days where no one is able to use their own cars because the pollution is so bad. Arturo Plaza explains that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. (Par 24)"" On these special days, we are able to see and enjoy how much better it is living in a cleaner enviornment! It is much healthier for us and is a major advantage says Elisabeth Rosenthal. She explains that by not driving our cars, we'll drasitcally reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. (Par 5)"" This is a great advantage and isn't intangible to us!

Everyday we carry stress on us from school, work, and family life so why add on any more? When driving, the level of stress in clearly inevitable. Worrying every second on how other people are driving, being cautious, and traffic jams amp it up even more! By not driving, our stress levels will subside quite substancioully. Heirun Walter is a civialian in a town with no car usage. She explains that ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. (Par 3)"" Even though she is a mother of two and a media trainer, she is able to live a life less stressed without her own car. Also for example, people living in the town are much less stressed because their children can play in the front yard with out them having to worry about the passing cars. Heidrun Walter explains that she can walk down the streets where the  sound of children and passing bicycles drown out the sounds of motors. ( Par 3)""

We can help ourselves and our enviornment by limitng our car usage daily! Limiting usuage could provide us with many advantages because our enviornment will not nearly be as polluted, and we will be less stresssed out. This is not intangible to us, and can only bring our living standards to another level! We will be healthier, and live a better life.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A89C66C7E89E,"Car usage could easily help detoriate waste and pollutants from our air. If every person in the United States were to limit the use of their driving then most of he worlds pullution and green house gases would vanish. In Beijing, China, it's a common, everyday precedure to put on a medical mask to prevent ""dirty"" air into getting into their lungs with ease. If every single person on the planet were to reduce the amount of driving they had to do, if they started driving hybrids, if they began using cars that ran on vegetable oil or electricity, we could practically erase the damage that has been done to our ecosystem via pollution. It would take a while but I don't see why we couldn't attempt to make Earth a little greener.

According to paragraph 41 in article four, a quote, stated ""A study last year found that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...."" meaning that they had either carpooled or used a friendlier alternative to cars and the gaseous fumes they emit. If people were to start riding bicycles we could drastically change not only our planet and the ecosystem, but we could also fix our health.

Most American's rarely excercise and it's a common thing to be mildy obese to extremely and deadly overweight. We could easily begin a new generation of healthier teens and adults if we were to introduce healthy lifestyle habits whilst still at a young age.

Article one shows that a new study that has been developed has created a new town with fewer drivers and everything is available when you walk outside. Vauban, Germany has led a research team to see the impact that driving motor vehicles has on society. There are 5,500 people living in this ""rectangular square"" mile that ""may be the most advanced expirement in low-car suburban life"" if they could do it, why can't we?

Paris has temporarily banned driving due to smog. Article 2 has said that their French citizens would be fined 22-euro ($31) for driving/being in a car! Congestion had died down around 60% and it's said that the smog had rivaled Beijing, China, known as ""one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Diesel fuel has a large role to play in this, but maybe if one day we could find other resources to fuel our driving needs, we could restore this beautiful planet and its atmosphere to what it once was.

B510C6670DBF,"Cars have been used as a main way of transportation for many years. Using cars as a way of transportation can have advantages and disadvantages. Unfortunately there are more disadvantages to using cars as a way of transportation, than there are advantages. Cars are ruining our environment and our society, therefore there should be a limit to car usage. Limiting car usage is not a bad thing, there are tons of advantages to limiting car usage.

Elisabeth Rosenthal has stated many advantages to limiting car usage in her articles, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" and ""The End of Car Culture."" Rosenthal states that cars make people tense and without cars people are less tense. When people are less tense they are happier and willing to do more things. Rosenthal also says that less cars results in less greenhouse gases. Cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases in Europe and 50 percent of the greenhouse gases in parts of the United States. Cars are the second largest source of America's emissions, therefore if cars are limitied the emissions will decrease.

Another author, Robert Duffer, also states advantages to limiting car usage in his article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog."" Duffer states that limiting car usage will lower the amount of air pollution. Paris decided to fine people on certain days if they were driving with a certain license plate number. Fining people for driving their cars enforced people to stop driving on certain days to lower the amount of car traffic. A result to Paris's new law was that congestion decreased 60 percent after the new law was enforced. Five days before Paris enforced their law, Paris suffered intensifying fog, therefore, the new law in Paris proves that cars are increasing the amount of air pollution.

A final author that has stated advantages to limiting car usage is Andrew Selsky in his article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" Andrew Selsky describes in his article a day in Bogota that has been designated to be car free. Every year Bogota has one day that they ban cars and only allow buses and taxis as a way of transportation and all violaters are fined $25. Bogota's plan is that limiting transportation will reduce smog and encourage people to find a new way of transportation. Selky describes that one participant in the ""car-free day"" stated that the day lowered air pollution and helped take away stress. The car-free day has also helped Bogota improve their sidewalks, bicycle paths, and, most importantly, their city.

Overall, limiting car usage will have numerous amounts of advantages both, for the environment, and for the citizens. The most beneficial advantage to limiting car usage is less air pollution, smog, and greenhouse gases. Rosenthal, Duffer, and Selsky all mentioned in their articles that less car usage will result in a better air to breathe. The second largest advantage to less car usage is that people can be happier and less tense. Both Rosenthal and Selsky state examples of people saying that after being forced to stop using cars as much, they began to feel less tense and happier. Limiting car usage will be very beneficial to citizens and the environment we live in.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
BE69E4551269,"Cars, buses, planes, and yes even motorcycles are all ways we use everyday to get from place to place.  You ever thought about how much air pollution and greenhouse gas affects happen each and everday just because we have to get to a destination.? Just like you, I wouldn't have thought that.  But hey, we all got to get around some way, whether it's healthy for our earth or not.

For starters, The world as we know it isn't the most healtiest place ever, for instance, take a look outside.  Is it clean ? You would probably answer no because  mainly because there's pollution, and debris everywhere you lay your eyes on.  Typically you see plastic bags, bottles, containers etc. To some it all up, FLITH.  What I'm trying to say here is that the world already isn't healthy so why continue and do something that is horribly harming the place we live in.  Statistics have shown that there making efforts in the past and future, two decades to make the cities denser, and better for walking. From my prior knowledge, in other cities such as Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.  Driving cars has become so inbeniefical that it's drastically changing the world slowly but surely.  Other places such as the capital of France, Beijing, and China are all well known for their most polluted cities in the world.  Causing many of people's lives to be tragically taken. Something needs to happen fast if we want our world to be a healthy enviornment for us and next generations to come .

Futhermore, Something that I think could really benieft us would have to be Hybrid cars.

Researchers have said that The Honda, and Toyota cars is what everyone needs to get in order to take a further step into positively changing the  Earth.  Mind you the car is low  on gas and is extremely eco friendly.  There's nothing that the climate can do to help us and make this a lot easier. So the  next step would have to be to create something that has many different beniefts to help uplift this world.  Limiting car usage will automatically reduce any air pollution and greenhouse effects.  Another thing that I found interesting would have to be that Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while expectations were made for plug-in cars, ( hybrids ). In my personal opinion, the world be a lot better off with these cars.  Their inexpensive, low pollution waste, and not to mention, they don't rely on gasoline.  There's no way to go wrong with these cars.

All in all, Transportation period is not healthy for the earth.  With tha being said, we need to take cautious as to what we do each and everyday.  I'm not saying don't drive in your cars anymore.  I'm just suggesting the whole world to take a break from all this mayhap and give the earth a rest.  Like in Bogota, Colombia .  Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated,or took buses to work during a car- free day . Just to leave the chaos and the devoid of traffic jams would be awesome. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce green house effect, air pollution,and smog. It's in our best interest to take a stand and change the enviornment.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
5806D41F16F8,"A car free world?! That sounds splended! Over seventy percent of Vauban's families in Germany do not own cars, and almost fifty-seven percent sold their car to move there due to the fact that they are almost ninety percent car free. There are so many advantages on limiting your car usage.

Think of it like this, you walk outside your front door and see hundreds of big bulky cars and trucks flying by giving off greenhouse gas emissions from their tailpipes, which is not good for you at all. Is that what you want to see every morning? Or do you want to swing up that front door, smell those roses, and see all your neighbors hopping on their bikes about to ride off to work.

There are so many benefits of limiting car usage but a main one is the health of the people. How many times a day do you see an overweight person struggling to get in or out of their car? Here in America it has become a casual sight. Now picture this, you see that same person getting on a bike and driving to and from work. How long do you think it is going to take until they start to loose weight and start to feel healthier, inside and out.

Some ignorant people say that the car industry is boosting, but I agree with those intelligent people who are seeing that the industry has been slowly declining. You see more people taking taxis, carpooling, or texting their friends to pick them up. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift."" -Mimi Sheller, an extremely smart professor at Drexel University. She is refering to the decline in car buying and the amount of people getting their licenses. Did you know that their has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 40 year olds getting a license, while the older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. According to a study found last year, young people driving has decreased twenty-three percent between two-thousand one and two-thousand nine.
