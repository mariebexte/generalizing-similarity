Besides the fact that youre releasing toxins into the air driving is also dangerous and you can harm other people if youre not careful. There should be limited car usage for multiple reasons. It is much cheaper to ride a bike, in some places when you own a car you have to pay seperatly for a garage to put it in and you also need to buy a car and cars are not cheap. Riding youre bike places is better for the enviroment and will save you money that otherwise would have to be pent on a car and putting gas in it. Also if there is limited car use then the green house gas emmision could be lowered. Another reason is that people who are driving are likely to be tense and when you're on a bike you could be much happier than driving a car everywhere.

When you own a car there is alot of maintnence that goes into the car. Also when you own a car you need to put gas in the car. In places like Germany there are very few places to park a car and they also have to pay to put it into a garage. Owning a car could be a very costly deal and it would be much easier to ride a bike down the street to the market or other places that you need to go.

The green hosue gas emission in the United States is up to fifty percent. Driving cars everywhere is ruining our enviroment. We need this earth to last as long as we can and polluting it is not going to help us. Riding your bike places is an efficent way of transportation it may not be the fastest but it will get you where you need to go without polluting our earth. Driving cars is not only polluting our earth but it is also killing people, irresponsable drivers that drive under the infuence have killed dozens of people. Riding a bike is much more safe.

It is said that allot of people are tense when they are driving and that giving up driving has made people much happier and less stressed. When you give up driving you also give up the stresses of driving and makes you hapier.

If there is a limited use on driving it could make you ess stressed, it could lessen the pollution on earth, and it could save you money and get you to places safer and cheaper than driving a car.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
2B09F20F4148,"Cars have been part of our daily lives for decades and have become somewhat idolized in American culture. But cars are slowly killing our planet and are speeding up the Greenhouse effect taking place within our Earths atmosphere. We've become entirley too dependent on cars to get us where we wish to go, making many people lazy. Cars also emit gasses that can harm our internal body structures, causing problems with lung diseases and just the simple act of breathing. Many cities from all over the world have taken measures to limit the use of cars in daily life, making their homes cleaner and healtheir to live in. More cities should start to do this as well to help save our planet and oursleves.

Environmentalists have hated cars for a long time because of the harmful effect it has to air we breathe. When near-record levels of smog filled the air of Paris, they enforced a temporary driving an in efforts to reduce the smog and within five days the smog cleared enough to allow citizens to start driving once again. In America, the number of drivers and car owners has been steadily reducing since 2005 and many experts belive it will continue to. A revolution could be started if enough people stop driving personal vehicles and instead walk, bike, or even just use public transportation.

People have adjusted over the years to things being given to them without them doing much to get it. Cars contribute to this and have caused laziness in many car owners. In Bogota, Columbia they have initiated and annual car-free day where everyone has to get to their jobs by means of biking or walking or taking public transportation. Carlos Atruro Plaza rides his two-seat bicycle with his wife to work and both like the idea of limiting air pollution caused by cars.  Pollution from cars can be dangerous for humans as well as the environment. By breathing in harsh gases we could aquire diseases such as COPD and lung cancer. Cars allow people to live unhealthy lifestyles in comfort while unknowing of the harm its causing. They are an insidious problem.

Cars have been gradually degenerating the planet and harming the people who use them. Thankfully many officials are working hard to limit this but we all have to contribute. Our planet will die if we dont do something to stop it, and if our planet dies, whats to become of the human race?    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
C2D5903F46A1,"Depending on where you live, cars are extremely important prop to a daily life. It gets you to point A to point B, whenever, wherever. In most people's opinion, we rely on the use of a car too much. We could easily walk to the place we are trying to get to without it costing money for gas or polluting the air. The decrease in car usage is a good change on the people and the planet.

People in Bogota, Colombia have noticed a problem with our usage of cars and is trying to make a difference. They have a ""Car-free day"" where you can't use automobiles, and if you do, you have to suffer the consiquence of a fine. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" it says in paragraph 21, Source 3. If one little day of not driving can mke such a difference in the atmosphere, imagine what would happen if we spent everyday like that! The change would be mindblowing! According to Source 2, half of greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for the smog in the United States, 12 percent in Europe.

I know what you're thinking, a life without cars??? Seems impossible but people in Vauban, Germany do it every single day. Many people are completely content with this lifestyle. When I had a car, I was always tense. I was much happier this way."" Said Heidrun Walter, a citizen of Germany. People have the potion to own a car much it costs more than here in AMerican and from Source 1, it seems to be a bigger hassle. Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author of Source 4, has two children, one 19 and the other one 21, they have to intention of getting a license. She explains how it's not that big of a prioity to them, the walk wherever they need to get. People seem happier about not having a car, less stress with traffic, no road range, and everything inbetween.

With less lisences becomes less accidents. Source 4 tells us that the difference between the amount of drivers in 2001 and the drivers in 2009 has decreased by 23 percent. That is something we need to work on in America because the amount of deaths by car accidents are increasing this decade than last decade. This can be prevented by not driving and if you are, drive safely.

With the decrease of car use, we can make sure that atmosphere is cleaner, more money is saved, less stress, and less deaths will be increasing.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
FDD92DC5BCBD,"Ever since the introduction of cars, there has been an excess of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases are good, but too much isnt as it pollutes the air and makes it hard to breathe that air. Riding a bike to work, or taking a bus, or even walking, instead of using a car helps the environment a lot. Some cities have already seen what extreme air polluton from cars can do. For example, Paris has gotten smog because of so much so much air pollution, smog is extremely hard and very dangerous to breathe. In short, an advantage of limiting car usage is that it is extremely beneficial for the environment as it stops some air pollution.

In the excerpt

Paris bans driving due to smog , Robert Duffer goes on about how Paris is covered with smog due to all the car usage(more so diesel fuel than gasoline). After just one day of the ban, the smog cleared up. This proves how beneficial for the environment limiting car usage is. As time goes on and awareness goes up, people realize how bad for the environment cars are, so as a response, participation in events like Day Without Cars is going up. The difference in the these events make is huge, especially in highly polluted areas like Bogota, Columbia    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
472FDDE0849E,"Cars are an essential part of life; they get us from place A to place B, but so do bikes, buses, trains, and your very own feet. In Vauban, Germany, residents have gone where few soccer moms or communting executives have ever gone: they have given up there cars. ""Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers."" (Rosenthal 1) In a world filled with pollution, stressed adults, and unhealthy people the advantages of limiting car usage are infinite.

Limiting car usage in the world would most definitely reduce the amount of pollution that is ruining our ozone layer. If it wasn't for the ozone layer humans would be long gone and wouldn't come back any time soon. In Paris, France, the goverment enforced a partial driving ban because of the near-record pollution. ""On Monday motorists with even - numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" (Duffer, 11) After five days of partial driving, congestion was down an incredible 60 percent. What if after five days they kept going? The city would look and feel brand knew and it would be safe for citizens  to breathe the air.  Similarily, our very own President Obama is trying to curb the United Sates' greenhouse gas emissions. "" As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" (Rosenthal 32) This means that people are choosing better ways to get from place A to place B, and if this trend persists "".. it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment..."" (Rosenthal 34) As you can see, there is hard eveidence that limiting car usage in the world would reduce the amount of pollution.

Furthermore, limiting car usage would help to relieve the stress of our everyday lives. How much traffic will there be? Am I going to get to work on time? Oh my god, I am out of gas and I passed the nearest gas station? Heidrun Walter, a citizen of the car-free Vauban, Germany, says,"" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Also, the stress levels of adults get higher when they become parents who have children driving. I know my mom doesn't sit through a full car ride with me without stomping on her imaginary brakes. But, it seems to be that, ""there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39 year olds getting a license.."" (Rosenthal 38) Moreover, even one day without driving makes the Columbians in Bogota, Columbia, less stressed and more relaxed. Business man Carlos Arturo Plaza rode a two-seat bicycle wih his wife to work that day. He says, "" It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air-pollution."" (Selsky 24) Limiting car usage, like these small cities have done, helped to relieve stress of their citizens which is why it is a huge advantage.

Lastly, limiting car usage would better the well being of our fellow citizens. Imagine, a business man who works in an office for 10 hours and then gets home just in time to eat and catch a few hours of quality television. When does this man have time to exercise? He sits in his car, sits at work, sits to eat, and sits to watch tv. If we limited car usage, this man would have to ride his bike or walk to the bus stop to get to work everyday, which is good for his health. Similarily, we have children who spend more time in front of a computer screen than playing outside like children should. But, what parent would let there kids play outside when there's tons of cars on the road? In Vauban, Gemrany, the streets are filled with bicylcles and the chatter of wandering children beacuse there are no cars to be afraid of. Limiting car usage can better the well being of oursleves and everybody around us.

In conclusion, there are many advantages of limiting car usage in the world today. On every sidewalk, you would find relaxed and healthy people breathing clean and healthy air. We can create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources , lower emissions and improve safety."" We will never achieve a perfect world but it is not romantic or naive to work towards one.                                                                                                                                             ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B295BC411B70,"There are a lot of advantages on why we should limit car usage. Limiting car usage to save money will help alot of families out because you dont always have to spend your money on buying a new car everytime it brakes down haveing to buy a car when it stops woking is a lot of money like $40,000. You can be using that money to buy food for your house or buying new parts for your car. Plus you would probably have to find a place that you can put your car like a garage at work or a parking lot that will have to fit millions of cars at a time.

In Vauban,Germany 70% of the people do not own cars and 57% sold a car just so that they can move to Germany. They have only sold them because in Germany there isnt alot of room thats why they have to descrease the usage of cars too. In the united states some people dont have cars because of the gas price or because they cant really aford a car. In Bogota,Colombia millions of colombians either have hiked,biked,or took buses on a car-free day to aviod traffic jams. There for car usage should be limited. It is also a good way to take away stress and air pollution tyo help the earth out. Also not a lot of people care about getting a listens because they find it better to walk or car pool with friend or use public transpotation so that is really helping out our planet because on less person means less on polluting the earth. But the only bad thing is that when they have children they are going to have to buy cars so they can beable to take their children were they need to get to like school or some kind of sports practice. So limiting car usage is good for the community and pedestrians, bicycle can be a good way to get places it saves time , lowers emissions and improves safety so there are no more traffic jams.

As a result 70 pecent of Vauban's familes do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""when i had a car i was always tense.

Beijing,China, which is known as one of the most polluted cites in the world. Millions of Colmbians hicked, biked, skated or took buses to work during  a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerfilydevoid of traffic jams.  People particapated in the event when it was raining. Two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in the Bogta in the mid-1900s. Its has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. We should try to decrease pollution by riding bike, skating, walikng more then using our cars to get us somewhere. Accoridnig to the article '' All of our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change'', said David Goldberg, am offical of Transportation for America, a fast growing coalition of hunders of grouos in the United States ... who are prmoting new communities that are less dependent on cars.

B8CCEB5C0CE6,"How important is a persons car to them? Do they really need to have their own car? It would be more eco-friendly if they just car pooled, or even walked. It seems this question has occured to a lot of people in high places. These people then used their positions to ban cars in many busy cities, with marvelous results.

Some where in Germany, there's a social experiment going on. This experiment is taking place in a small suburbian town called Vauban. The people in this community have taken a huge leap of faith and got rid of all cars. But don't worry, they couldn't be happier. Their streets are nearly empty with virtually no traffic, they have less stress, and they don't have to worry about all the expenses that come with car ownership. The streets are very close together with stores on pratically every corner, to prevent having to go long distances. All they have to do is take a nice stroll down main street and have everything at their fingertips. They don't have to worry about people parking on their front lawns, or people flying dangerously fast down the street. It's just simple and easy.

Granted, having a car availible does have benefits. Owning a car can give people a sense of freedom. It's like a reassurance that no matter what, people have the means to get something done. Without having to depend on others. If there's an emergency, people don't want to have to wait for the next bus to come through. They want to get there as quickly as possible. Owning a car makes that possible. Owning a car can also make visiting that aunt that lives three states away possible. Without having to ride a cramped, smelly bus to get there.

On the other hand, going without a car certainly has more pros than cons. There's less stress, it's cheaper, there's less traffic, it's healthier, and there's less pollution. For instance, in Paris, there was so much smog, they had to ban cars. If people violated the ban they had to pay a fine, or even get their car impounded. They blamed diesel fuel for the smog, because in France, that's nearly 67 percent of cars fuel. The cities' smog rivaled Bejings', and that's the most polluted city in the world! Going without a car is also less stressful. People don't have to worry about how they'll make the next car payment, or how they might run out of gas. There's also virtually no chance of getting in an accident. Afterall, how is someone going to get in an accident without a car?

Not only is going without a car the better economical choice, its the best personal choice. Why would someone deliberately put themsleves through the stress of owning a car, when they can easily go without? Though it has some benefits, like being independent, those benefits are greatly outnumbered by the pros of going without. It's just cheaper and less stressful. Who wouldn't want that?

5475FCB406ED,"Over the course of years new technologies have been inveted to better our life style. there have been inventions like trains,airplanes and boats to better our transportion; however there is one transportion vehicle that has spun up many contriversies. The automobile or ""car"" as most people call it has spanwed more harm than good; rates of pollution have risen and smog can be found almost anywhere. Limiting the usage of cars should a solution due to the advantegs of reduced pollution, less green house gas and it could even make a person happier!

As most industrial inventions cars do produce tons of smog due to Diesel fuel a chemical found in cars. Smog has been such a issue that the city of paris actully had to enforce a law that would ban cars for a few days. This law was so stressed that any one caught driving would bee fined 22 euros in which converted in dollars would add up to 31 dollars. Paris had more smog than any other european capital; they had about 147 micrograms compared to London on the other hand which only had 79.7. With such high numbers of micrograms the intnsity of the smog worsend causing the extreme idea of baning cars. This example should be a reason on why we should reduce the usage of automoblies so that extreme measures are not acted on; but more importanly the possibility of having pure of cleansed oxygen.

In alliance of having minimum pollution safety is aslo one advantge that reducing driving may enhance according too Bill Ford executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company; stated that the plan of reducing usage of cars did bring a safer world for pedestrians not only does is bring about safety but it does conserve natrual resources like oil that may take hundreds of years to replenish. We need to keep in mine that as inhabitants of earth we must care and vaule every natrual resource. We only have one planet and we must protect it. Reducing driving has been such a triaumph that a mother of two even said ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" once again this statment only poves that reducing the usage of automobiles is a better life style for all.

All in all reducing driving does bring some great advantges and should really be consider as a plan to make the world a better place. this plan should be acted upon all over the world.             ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
94CCB4234EAE,"Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions (Rosenthal 34). Global warming is becoming more of an issue as time goes on,  part of this problem is vehicles and their pollution they let off. People are getting more and more worried about this as temperatures continue to rise on Earth. They are trying to do something about it. One of the more popular suggestions to help solve the issue is to limit car usage. I know, it seems pretty bizare due to the fact that some towns, such as my own, do not have everything citizens need within a walking distance. Benefically, ""stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.(Rosenthal 6)"". It is thought that it will ""drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States (Rosenthal 5)"". People also are not putting forth an effort to help decrease the pollution by buying hybrids, instead they buy Diesels. Diesel gas has more pollutants then regular gasoline.

Safety is another reason to reduce car usage. Think about it, if pedestrians reduced their car usage by 50 percent the percentage of car accidents would also decrease. This could save many people's lives; animals as well. Rosenthal said, ""Cities could become denser, and better for walking"", which also makes it safer. To go along with saving lives lets mention health. Americans are getting more and more unhealthy and overweight. It is a rising problem in our country. Many people die from it everyday; obesity can be stopped. One way to lose weight and get in shape is exercise. Imagine how much better shape Americans would be in if we actually had to walk to the grocery store or McDonald's. It would make us think ""do we really need that?"". Those extra burned calories count, sitting in a car does not burn many calories.

Traffic jams are aggravating to most people, with the decreasing number of car owners time is being saved. There is less traffic. Andrew Selsky studied car-free day in Bogota, and he stated ""rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic(28)"", this means time is being saved and people are getting to their destinations faster. Another idea was said by Carlos Arturo Plaza ""it's a good opprotunity to take away stress...(Selsky 24)"". Congestion stresses everyone out, whether running on time, running late or just taking a leisurely drive. It makes everyone stress. Congestion actually decreased 60 percent in Paris (Duffer 14). Heidrun Walter also said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

Limiting car usage helps a number of problems throughout the globe, such as to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, improve safety, and even improve your health (Rosenthal 43). You may wonder what other ways are there for you transport to the places you need to go. You could walk, jog, hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation. There are so many options and you have the opprotunity to meet new people and exercise if you're having a busy day. America should try it out just for a day and see what it leads to.

2DD096474F33,"Something big is beginning. Cars are starting to be a questionable need. Of course we need them in some situations. But the sales of cars are declining. People are becoming more united as one. The way it should be. If we worked together, we could accomplish many things. But besides that, cars give off emission that gets trapped in our atmosphere. We need to conserve the ozone layer. Without it, skin cancer is sure to hit hard with the UV rays beating down on us. I believe that cars are becoming outdated. We still need them, but do we really need so many? So many giving off harmful gases and destroying our home? The smog must be clouding our perception of things because we aren't thinking straight. We're destroying our planet because of money. I get off topic because the truth is here and this essay is a way to spread the truth. United as one. We can do anything. We're all equal. Nobody is better than anyone else. No country is better than any other. Anyone's beliefs do not overpower anyone else's. So yeah, cars aren't so bad, but they're not all that good either. We drive past others every day not wondering where they're going. Don't you want to know what you're doing? Yes. You! We're all the same person.

Great minds think alike huh? Well...shouldn't we address the real problem then? Money is a piece of paper. Material. Why do we need it. We PAY for food and water. The things we need to survive. I can understand why we do. But what if we worked manually for a good cause then got payed in food and supplies for that? It could work. We don't aknowledge eachother. It's like we're scared of eachother. I don't why. We're all animals trying to achieve happiness. We can do it. If people stop boxing in their beliefs and limit themselves. The mind once stretched to new ideas, will never return to its original dimensions. Expand your mind. I'm not saying do drugs. Just be more open-minded as we all go home at the end of the day and wonder what everybody else is doing. How do they live? The same as you. Our body is an extension to our soul and our mind is what puts energy out there. Imagine this, your mind is a garden. Your thoughts are seeds. Decide what you want to grow and let it be put out into the physical world.

I don't care what I make on this writing test because, maybe, just maybe my thoughts will be heard by someone who thinks the same. Studies show, there is an increasing talk about something you'd hear in a prophecy type of movie. Indigo children are being born every day into this life the government has set up for us.

It is typical to think of a car as just a way to get from one place to another faster, but what about the effects of driving. Cars are one of many things that cause pollution, releasing gases that harms our Earth we live on, the very planet that keeps us alive. Limiting car usage could benifit the earth and give you advantages.

""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by  Robert Duffer, the title it self says all, paris has a pollution issue due to the cars that they drive and stated in the article because of  ""near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partical driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Because of the actions Paris had to make it reduce the congestion  in the captial of France by 60 percent, those who didn't follow to what was told ""suffer a 22-euro fine,"" about ""4,000 drivers were fined"" according to Reuters. We shouldn't only resort to cars as transportation, inventions such as the bicycle are still around to this day and the percentage rate of bicycles causing pollution is, zero.

Author Andrew Selsky states in his article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during the car-free day."" This day was done so it can encourage people of altervative transportation and reducetion of smog, and according to the article some may say it works. ""It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" Stated by bussiness man, Carlos Arturo Plaza.

The advantages and possiblitys people could have if they limited the usage of vehicles, in Duffers article it is proclaim  that ""parks and sport centers also bloomed through out the city."" The once beated up side walk, is now restored with ""broad, smooth sidewalks,"" and coming back to the congestion, ""rush- hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic."" There possiblities bloom with the upscale of shopping districts and new restraunts increasing.

It is understandable for one to not like the idea of reducing the usage of ones car, but if you sit back and realize it, cars are ""responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emission"" and thats just in Europe. In the United State, there percentage increases to 50 percent. All according to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, In ""German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.""  Beijing, Chine is guilty of being the ""most poplluted cities in the whole world."" Everyone is a culpret when it comes to poplution and that is why everyone should take time to look at the facts and change, help the earth that helps you. Instead of driving your car to work thats just down the street, take a bike, If not take a shuttle. Don't relie on one source of transportation.

The opportunitys that could accore if one just limit the usage of his or hers motor vechile are endless, but it all starts with a choice. Rethink the way you see cars, think about the effect and possiblities that could offend mothernature. The advantages such as building cardio and decreasing of stress and pollution. The time to change the amount of times we use our car is now because limiting the usage of cars is right, and when you give to the planet the planet gives back.                    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
9938EA5EE964,"Everyone assumes that the best way of transportation is by a car. Teenagers dream of getting their license on their sixteenth birthday and maybe even getting a car. Most adults use cars to get to and from work, drive their kids around and do fun activites. But what people don't understand is that there are so many other alternatives that ultimately result in a happier and healthier planet. There are so many downfalls with driving and owning a car that many are now believeing that it is much more reasonable to just not own a car.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal, line 6). Having cars stress people out and people don't even realize this. There are so many responsiblities that come with driving. No one enjoys sitting in long traffic jams. It is annoying and quite bothersome. Everyone gets so frustrated, nevermind the amounts of accidents that lead to injury and death from it all.

In Colombia there is a day once a year in which cars can not go on the road or they are served with a fine. This effort is to try to bring stress levels down and stop air pollution. ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the street of this capital city eerily and devoid of traffic jams"" (Selsky, line 23). This idea promoted excersize and got people out and doing things in the community. The citizens clearly were not against this day or else they wouldn't have been acticve. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city"" (Selsky, line 28). This just goes to show what driving does. It isolates people. Without all the cars, one is more willing to spend time outside and interacting with other people and since people were out and about more and enjoying the community, the area has gotten more presentable and pleasureable to be in. ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Selsky, line 29). Officals and shop owners are making more of an effort because everyone is more active and caring.

In Paris, the officals made an effort to try and clean up the cities pollution rates. They assigned a day where even number licensed plates could not be on the road and a day for odd numbered plate cannot be on the road or else they will be fined. ""Congestion was down 60 percent"" (Duffer, 14). If anything, it goes to show that the amount of cars on the road is absurb. 60 percent is more than half, that's a lot of traffic. Paris primarily uses diesel, causeing a lot more pollution in this busy city. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"" (Duffer, line 17). Paris is a very touristy area and people go in hopes to see a beautiful city. This project went so well that officals planned to continue it. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" (Duffer, line 19). If officals planned to continue this idea, than it must be benifical in some way. If citizens just made an effort to not drive everywhere, than restrictions would not have to be mad. It's because of the amount of driving that is going on that officals have to get involved.

""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."" (Rosenthal, line 37) Motor vehicals cause so much danger to Earth. The amount of pollution is so high and dengerous. It is much easier to prevent than everyone believes. One could simply take the bus, ride a bike, only drive to work and needed places, walk, and even car pool. There are an abundant amount of ways to prevent so much pollution and stress. It's all over the world that this is an issue; Paris, Colombia, the United States, and many other places. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. "" (Rosenthal, line 11). That is a lot. It isn't difficult to help prevent this.

In the long run, not driving would result in happier people anyways. Cars are so expensive that is would cause less aggravation and economic stress as well as the basic stress of just driving and being in traffic. Society could make the world so much cleaner and safer for the next generations. It starts now. Get a bike or a pair of walking shoes and start getting active in the community. Start making the changes now so it isn't forced by officals later. make the effort and show the next generations how life should be. This could lead to a much happier and healthier life style.

C100920147E5,"Limiting car usuage will give us many benefits. A projects such as Vauban and BOGOTA were completed to  show us the multitude of advantages recieved from it.

Reducing car usuage would be excellent for our enviorment. Research shows us that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenshouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States""(Rosenthal). Our world is very materialistic and sometimes we forget that to even have life, we must have the enviorment. ""Cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities""(Rosenthal). Therefore, limiting the amount of cars would allow us to have more efficent green houses, and more land area for plants.

Money is also a huge factor here. The government spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in the transportation department. By lowering the number of cars on the road, the less wear and tear is done to them. This would be beneficial in many departements because then we would have more money for the things we need but cannot afford in our area and or country. Infact, ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transportation""(Rosenthal).

Driving also causes stress. Traffic jams, new or confusing road signs, attitudes of passengers, are all distributions of stress, especially when you get lost! If the amount of driving we did by ourselves was cut back, we could also cut back stress. BOGOTA helps to prove this, and even says that violaters of no car day were ""fined $25(Selsky).

Lastly, if we do not put a stop to so much driving, our personal health may be in risk. According to souce 4, ""the car industry is the second largest in the world."" This means that the air is constantly being pulluted with exhuast. Which also means that what's in your lungs at this very moment, could be a lot more than just oxygen. It's very scary to think that the same chemicals it takes to run your car, might just be what's floating around in your body. This could lead to multiple health problems and future diseases. Therefore, this issue needs to be taken control of immediately.

In conclusion, reducing car usuage would be an amazing thing to do for oursleves and the people around us. We would save our air and bodies from being polluted, we would save money, and save time not stressing out. Who doesn't want these things? Limiting car usuage would be a fantastic idea.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

But why drive a car and sit there for up to thirty minutes in traffic when you can walk there in under ten or ride a bike in just under five, now if that sounds like great logic to you then great; if you are like the majority of people in this current day and age then you would not need to feel the erdge to drive, you would rather ride a bike and feel the breeze of the fresh crisp air in your hair.

The new trend of living is here, more and more communities are popping up that are car free. As the first source has stated ""...70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" more and more people are deciding to not own a car or even to just sell their cars so that way it is not a burden on their shoulders to maintain the cars. Most of the people who decide to give up their cars say it's a much happier way to live.

Some countries are even putting a ban on driving on certain days like paris did in source two. It stated that ""...motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine."" This ban went on for roughly five days for the smog cleared enough for all to resume preferd ways of transportation.

In colombia the government made a car-free day so that way more people would get comforatable with finding alternate ways or commuting said in the third source ""car-free day is spinning into a big hit Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky.

AABD8099A27D,"In many places all across the world, the amount of car usage is decreasing more and more as the years pass by. In places such as Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; and Bogota, Colombia; there are times when you are fined if you operate a vehicle. Why would a city ban one of the most useful personal transportations invented? These cities all had goals for transportation to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and costs, improve safety, relieve stress, and to promote public transportation. All of these goals, by which were accomplished when the use of motor vehicles were limited.

According to source 1 'In German Suburb, Life goes on without cars', the residents of Vauban, Germany disagree with the usage of cars. The entire suburb is designed to be ""car-free"", besides the main thoroughfare. Understand that car ownership is allowed, but there is an exteremely scarce amount of parking spots, and that the price of a garage, that is located at the edge of this suburb, costs $40,000 when you buy your home. As a result of this, 70% of residents do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their car to live in Vauban. The goal was to start a movement called 'smart planning', which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes.

According to source 2 'Paris bans driving due to smog', the city of Paris, France enforced a partial ban to clear the air of the global city. Almost 4,000 drivers were given a 22-euro fine, which is equivalent to $31, because they were driving their cars. Diesel fuel was at fault for the excessive amount of smog in the city. Diesels make up 67% of the vehicles in France. The goal was to decrease the amount of smog throughout the city.

According to source 3 'Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota', the residents of Bogota, Colombia are familiar with a 3 year running 'Day without Cars'. There is a large turnout where one day out of the year the use of motor vehicles is banned, which would face violators with a $25 fine. The goal of this city was to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation.

In conclusion, the result in limiting the usage of cars would be very effective and beneficial. The residents, as a whole, would save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and costs, improve safety, relieve stress, and promote public transportaion.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

They give an individual the capablity to live far away from work and still be able to arrive at their job on time. Car also permit one to travel with multiple people as once. However, cars come with the huge problem of pollution, and many counrties have banned the use of cars to combat this issue.

Once Paris, France had seen recored amounts of pullution, in the form of smog, the government enforced a partial driving ban. This ban allowed car oweners with even numbered licese plates to drive one day and car owners with odd numbered to drive the following day. As a result of the ban the somg covering paris had decreased. On the other hand, businesses such as Delivery companies had lost revenue seening as they weren't able to drive.

Other cities ,such as Bogota, Colombia have followed Paris's example and started a car-free day once a year. For three years now this car-free day has promoted alternative transportation, such as walking, biking, or riding a bus. Since, the car-free day has been stared 118 miles of biking paths, broad side walks, and sport centers have been created along with the decrease of polluted air.

Although some cities may put restrictins on cars in the city Vauban, Germany an expermental suburb has been created in which cars are banned completely. As a result 70 percent of the citizens who live here don't own a car. As a result greenhouse gas have been drastically reduced. To make this possible city planners have created communities that are denser and in walking distance of stores and restraunts.

In conclusion cars come with many benifits such as, having the freedom to live anywhere, travelling miles in the matter of minutes, and traveling whenever you want to. However, Paris has put a restricted ban on cars. Bogota has a car-free day. Vauban has created suburbs with a comlete ban on cars. all these efforts are to decrease the pollution created by cars millions of people drive everyday.                                                                                                                            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

first thing if people don't want drive they could just ride bike to work that help them with exerics. Also they don't know that the gas is ever high and they can't affored it and that why they walk or ride the bike.

Another reason is that 27 people had there can impounded or on side of the road becuase  they ran out of gas. when you drive and you see your gas meter and it on the E and your car just stop and you about 2 miles form the gas stion and you have a gas can in the back but you don't want to walk and you know you need that gas so that you can get home you think,think,think and you said i'm walk and you get out the car get the gas can and go. and people don't like drive they can just ride the train to work or the bus becuase you don't really have to put gas in your can you just ride and get drop off were you work.

Next thing i should think that they should make sidewalk for people that want to walk to school,home,work,or freinds house. Well if they family want to go on a trip to see there grandma then they can take there car and go see her. And what ever car you got please look for the limit becuase some car drink gas and then you have to fill it back up again. If it was just less driveing they approach stores,and other thing that they can walk to. If you need a ride home you can call the tax and they will take you home and you really don't have to drive or put gas in the car.

I think people should stop drive becuase you really don't need to drive every day about 4,000 people don't have there license and the drive. if you drive and it cold you should trun a on the heat to low becuase heat will messup your emission. and that why i should think that people should walk stead of drive all the time.

We all the people should just say that Monday,Tuesday,Wensday we all should drive to school,work or where ever and Thursday,Friday,Saturday they should walk to work or take the bus. And that why the people should drive less. what you think?    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifiying smog. Beijing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

7788EA043A3B,"Limiting car usage can affect our enviroment in so many ways. Although you may have not ever thought about it before, limiting car usage can help not only our enviroment, but ourselves as well. Let's talk about what can happen if we ditch our vehicles.

People in Germany have completely given up their cars for the most part already. Since most of their residents are suburban pioneers, they find almost no point of even owning a car. Here in America we use cars for transportation (for almost everything)! In Germany, many have admitted that owning a car makes them stressd. Heidrun Walter who is a media trainer said, ""I'm much happier this way."" The trend of not owning a car isn't just growing in Europe. Lot's of families from Chicago are abandoning their cars as well.

The city of Paris has banned driving for a good enviromental reason. There has been so much pollution in the city from smog that there was a driving ban to clear the city's air. If anyone is caught driving, they are sent a fine of 22-euro, which is $31 here in the US. Although this may seem like a harsh punishment, it has helped Paris overcome a lot of its smog. The only exceptions when it comes to driving are delivery companies and public transit.

Bogota, Columbia has jumped on the bandwagon along with many other places. This country put a ban on cars to prevent smog as well. There was a huge turnout on their part for doing this. Buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Ever since the day where they banned cars for a short period of time, there has been many other new advancements in their society. Parks and sports centers have spread throughout the city, uneven sidewalks have been replaced, rush-hour restrictions have drastically cut traffic, and new restaurants/upscale shopping districts have opened up.

Last, limiting car usage also has a great effect when it comes to getting rid of greenhouse gas emissions. Research has suggested that Americans are now buying fewer cars, fewer licenses, and overall driving less. It seems as many people are starting to open up their eyes and realize all of the long term effects that come with car overusage. Article 4 clearly states that many sociologist believe that if this pattern persist, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment. It is said that creating cities in which pedestrian, bicyle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to not only save time and conserve resources, but also lower emissions and improve our safety.

All in all, there are many advantages when it comes to limiting car usage. We can help dramatically improve our enviroment and safety. More people should take into consideration about being more conservative when it comes to transportation. We can work around a lot of it by simply walking or riding our bikes short distances rather than wasting a lot of energy with cars.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
8836AD393A34,"Around the world we have been seeing trends of reducing automobile usage. Reducing automile usage would have a number of advantages but it must be approached in the right way. If the US were to attempt to ""limit car usage"" as the prompt states, the movement would undoubtedly recieve a lot of push back and would slow to a stop. Reducing car usage by building public transportation and smart suburbs would be ideal. This would cut down our co2 emissions and be reduce the number of car related injuries and deaths.

First, if there is one thing I know about American politics, its that political parties will oppose just about anything, no matter how advantageous or logical, ""limiting car usage"" is no exception, if the Democratic party were to suggest such a thing, it would create an upoar from the Republican and Libertarian parties. This would become more controversial than gun restrictions, we would have another surge of anti-environmentalism propoganda, Limbaugh would be spitting ""tree-huggers"" again, and more likely than not, our country would drift even further away from any sort of environmental solutions. Trying to limit car usage on a Federal level would be met by utter failure.

However, there is a right way to approach this issue in the US. If we were to ask for grants to build public transportation systems, encourage car-pooling, and build efficient bike paths, car usage could be significantly reduced.

The advantages of reducing our use of automobiles in the US are well worth the cost.  Transportation is the second largest contributor of co2 emissions, just behind power plants. (Rosenthal, paragraph 34) Cutting these emissions, even by a fraction would have great benefits to our environment. David Goldburg, an official of Transportation for America states, ""All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change, how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid."" (7) The US has been moving towards a lower car use trend since the recession, ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (29).

In summary, reducing automoblie use in the US should be a goal, but it cannot be approached through laws or restrictions. We can model our suburbs and cities to be more friendly to alternate transportations, and we can build public transportation systems across America. The reduction of co2 emissions from cars will curb our contribution to Global Climate Change and make a better future for generations to come.                                                        ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
49604EAA151E,"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Decreasing the amount of time citizens use personal motorvehicles positively impacts the environment and the state of mind of people. The lack of driving personal cars is becoming more widely accepted in several countries for different reasons. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, is an experimental district testing the lifestyle that does not use cars. Paris banned driving for environmental reasons, and Bogota decided to try it out too. Also, it is a trend in America for the purpose of saving money and because there are other convenient options.

The decrease in fumes from cars is very beneficial to the environment. People and organizations are making drastic efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. According to paragraph five of ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" twelve percent of greehouse gas in Europe is caused by passenger cars and fifty percent in some areas of the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities because emissions from cars contributes to half of the pollution in America. In the Article by Robert Duffer, ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"" he describes the event that Paris had to declare a ban on half of the drivers because the  large amount of smog that lingered over Paris. Colombia even has a day dedicated to being free of cars to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. All of these events show the severity of environmental problems caused by cars and people making efforts to promote a better environment.

Also, a decrease in personal motor vehicles causes people to have a better state of mind. Heidrun Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" With a car comes a lot of responsibility which leads to a lot of stress on a person. Not having a car is one less bill to pay and thing to take care of which for many people is a better way of living.""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" stated Carlos Arturo Plaza on car-free day in Bogota, Colombia. The car free day has also promoted other things to bloom in the city such as parks, sidewalks, and restaurants that people really enjoy. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article ""The End of Car Culture,"" her children have other priorities than recieving their license because they have other things they would rather focus on that they enjoy more. All of these things promote people living a healthier and happier life.

Overall, limiting car usage is a ""win-win"" situation for everyone. Decreasing fumes and the stress of a car causes the environment and people to be happier. Promoting public trasportation or other ways of getting places is better for everyone. It is a growing trend all over the world, and for a good reason. A lack of fumes from cars will clear the air, and clear the minds of fellow citizens.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

As mentioned in the articles ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"", ""Car Free Day is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogota"", and ""The End of Car Culture"", many citizens of many different cultures see that the lowered usage of vehicle transportation doesn't only decrease how many greenhouse gasses are getting in the atmosphere but also improves our wellbeing by reducing stress levels. Not only does it help us relieve stress and what ails us but it also makes the distance we have to travel to purchase food much shorter, as cited in ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", giving us the opportunity to restock our supply over time instead of buying multiple cart loads at once.

Secondarily, according to the article ""The End of Car Culture"", having access to busses and other public transportation can improve our safety. It is also seen in this article that ""at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford came up with a business plan to create a world where personal vehicle ownership isn't needed or is undesirable.

With this new plan, there would be improved safety by having official drivers providing the bus transportation and private car transportations. Both of these ways are liable to give us extra time in our days by decreasing the probability of traffic and will give us ultimate safety while getting from point a to point b.

Yes it actually would,because according to source 3""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" not using our cars is ""a good opporunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Now if you live in Paris using your car is not the best idea. Paris has banned driving due to smog. Smog can be very fatal if you inhale it almost every day. Source 2 says that ""motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave thier cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine($31)"". Who would really want to pay that fine just because you were using your car? Nobody. So leave your car at home.

Source 4 states that""the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995"". According to an ananlysis by Doug Short Of Advisor Perspectives this is partially because Americans could not afford new cars. Cars are really expensive and spending all that money on it is not worth it. Plus the insurance bill you have to pay every month and the oil changes and then the gas. It is way to much. If we stopped using our cars it would be very much beneficial for carbon emissions and the enviorment. Teens and young adults don't even bother to get a drivers license.

13D42BBC6B56,"Benifits on Limiting Car usage

Cars are one of mans geat creations but they are great because they are eassy not because they are good. In hevy populated areas cars make up about 50% of the greenhouse gas. and in just europe family cars make up 12% of green house gas. Some cars are efficient more than others but those tend to be more coastly.

First, green house gasses are a big part of the reson for global warming. Green houses also affect th ozone which could help to prevent it. Paris band driving because of how many people drive it started creating a smog and if that gets thick enough it could affect your respitory system. people who drive in countries where it was band they will be fine.

caust is a big part of beeing enviornmentaly friendly. I have a truck and it only gets about 18mpg which isnt that bad but my friends mom has a prius that gets like 40mpg and it can switch over to electricity. Cars with good fuel efficiency generaly are more expencive.

If people who have bikes ride them to say dinner once a week insted of driving they will save an amence amount of money just from not buying gas. Gas was just up to about $4.00 a gallon but now its at an all time low but we dont know when it will go back up. There are a tn of people in this world that are over waight and just walking like one a week could help.

To sum it all up, if every body just hepled out when they can the world can be a better place and maybe people can live longer.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
9C77931379FA,"it's mainly talking about how many percent of people do not own cars or people who old there cars. If I had a good car nothing wrong with it. I would make payments on it. It might not be the best car but hey long as i can get somewhere on time. I really don't know much about Vaubans but they are knid of nice. My dream car is V8 Titans Nessian i really love those trucks I hoping my mother will get me one but that all depends on my behavior at home and school plus grades those are more important. When the suburbs came out i thought it came from china but it said ""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class familes from chicago to shanghai tend to make their homes. And that experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes.... Passengers cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" It also saids ""Vauban home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" I love cars well actually theres curtent cars that i like but hey you got to love them right V8 titan i love the most.    ",1,Car-free cities,Text dependent
198F3ADE3E80,"Cars have been helpful to citizens since before the 1800s. They transport us wherever we need to go and allow us to get to our destination faster then walking. Cars are more bad then helpful to human beings and nature in many ways. Limiting car usuage is probably the smartest thing in helping everyone in the world and keeping our planet clean. Instead of driving a car everyday which makes a big difference can also effect us to start walking once in while and effect our exercising. There are many advantages in limiting car usuage such as stopping air pollution, lowering gas prices, and worrying about our health. Citizens will never stop driving cars even if the cars are flying in the sky, but it would be an amazing way to start 50% of people to start using cars for only needs.

An advantage in limiting car usage is stopping air pollution. Air pollution has been a big deal since all transportions such as cars,train, and airplanes were created. If us as citizens stop air pollution, it can drop a high number of people that have conjestion problems and stop smog from appearing. Also, the change in temperature of cold nights and warm days will cause our cars to trap the emissions which is making it even worse. Limiting car usuage to eliminate pollution we see everyday can cause a cleaner air that we breath and preventing alot of heart problems. Also,pollution does not just affect us but animals too. By driving our cars daily,polluting the air can cause an animal to be extinct.

Gas prices are an important thing to a car. Citizens pay weekly to add more gasoline to there car which is expensive. Decreasing the amount of time we drive a car can give us twenty dollars back into our bank a week. Gas is what causes air pollution to enter the air and cause us humans to have health problems. Having a car really makes alot of things complicated and stressful with money,health, and our planet. Also, taxes on gas causes us to be upset because we get our money taken away to keep our veihcles on the road to get where we need to go. Limiting car usuage will help everyone have less problems.

Limiting ourselves to driving a car everyday will help everyone. If we started to walk more or have hybrids , that helps the planet and us rather then polluting and suffering under gas. Biking is a healthy way of transportation because we are exercising and not wasting money on gas. We do not need to stop driving because it is necessary that we need veihcles to go places and take us to see other people as well but limiting ourselves to driving less then 7 days a week, 24 hours will help everyone. Even completely not have having a car is a brilliant decision for people who do not depend on driving or spending money on gas. We would be alot more caring towards nature and having more advantages towards car usage.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

47DAF3375BF3,"Air pollution has been a major issue in the U.S for quite some time now. The number one cause of air polution is car exauhst emisions. Engine exauhst from a cars tailpipe shoots into the air we breathe ever so often. Limiting the use of cars would exponentially help reduce the amount of air poluition we have within the U.S today. Knowing this, our main concern as humans right now should be trying to limting car usage in order to reduce harmful greenhouse emissions that cause air pollution and smog.

In Vauban, Germany, citizens have give up their cars and have moved into an experimental upscale community where cars are not highly used. Even though car ownership is allowed, there are only two locations to park the vehichle and would cost $40,000 to buy the parking space. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars in order to move into the experimental community. Media trainer and mother of two, Heidren Walter says:""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Germany has already taken a first step in order to help reduce car emissions in the air. David Goldberg, an official of transportation for America states:""All of our development since world was II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions while the United States is responsible for up to 50 percent greenhouse gas emissions in some car-intensive areas.

On Monday in Paris, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same ban applied to odd-numbered license plates the following day. Sadly almost 4,000 drivers were fined and twent-seven people had their cars impounded. In the capital of France, congestion of smog was down 60 percent after five-days. Diesel fuel is the leading blame, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. Not only is Germany taking small steps in order to reduce air pollution by limiting cars but Paris is also doing the same thing to help reduce smog.

Not only is Germnay and Paris trying to limit car usage but so is Colombia. In Bogota, Colombia; there is a program they have in which millions of Colombians either skate, bike, hike or took public transportation in order to get to work for one day out of the entire year. The goal is to promote alternative transportatin and reduce smog. Violators would face a fine of $25. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza commented:""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Two other Colomian cities, Cali and Valledupar, have decided to join the event in order to help reduce car usage.

Now we finally reach the United States after hearing about Germany, Paris, and Paris in terms of trying to limit the use of cars. Michael Sivak, who studies the trend of car usgae in America and is a reasearch professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, reports:""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down to two to three years before the downturn, I think that means something more fundamental is going on."" Mr. Sivak's research has found demogaphic shifts in the driving populations that suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16-39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their license at they age. A study last year has also found that driving by young people decresaed 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

Limitng the use of cars is starting to slowy take its place within the United States, Germany, Paris, and even Colombia. Hopefully more and more people around the world will do their part in order to help reduce greenhouse emissions such as smog and air pollution.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B0A5401CA9FA,"Cars are a basic need for people today we use them to go from point A to point B in the fastest way posible. But one must ask themselves ""do i really need the car?"", ""would i be better off without one?"", how do you tell people that what they have depended on for movement could be hurting them. I believe that cars should have a limited usage in cities because cars affect our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas, they cause smog to form around cities, and cause us to move through life at the fastest pase posible. A limited car usage would change the way we see the world its beauty, its adventersm, and we would be able to save the world from our distruction.

There is a community in Germany called Vauban where people have given up their cars. 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, 57% sold their cars just to move to Vauban, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much hapier this way,"" media trainer and mother of two Heidrun Walter says in the artical ""In German Subuerb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"". Also the artical states that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and responsible for up to 50% in the United States. Vauban houses up to 5,500 resident within a rectangular square mile, which makes it posibly the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life, stores are placed just a short walk away so that no car is needed.

Smog; a thick layer of black fog that hurts your lungs and can even kill you. Paris had to ban driving due to smog , cars with even numbered license plates would not be allowed to drive one day and the following day cars with odd numbered license plates would not be allowed to drive. 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters and 27 people had their cars impounded due to their reaction to the fine. This statement from the artical ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" show that cars are responsible for a gas that can kill people, and that people dont respond well to being told what to do. In one week the ban was lifted because the smog had cleared enough but not all the way, just a week of limited car usage cleared the skys imagin what a year of it would do.

Cars have us going the fastest we can and people have started to live that way through life. In Bogota they have a day free of cars every years like its a holiday. People left their keys on the counter and insted hiked, biked, skated and took the bus. Even in the rain people didnt use their cars, "" The rain hasnt stopped people from participating,"" says Bogata Mayor Antanas Mockus. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says "" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"". The quotes from the artical "" Car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" show that with out cars people feel realeved of stress and are able to have a good time.

In conclusion limited car usage would help us presurve the world and create a enviroment that could help people aswell. Cars are one of the most used products in the world people might not want to give up their cars but eventually might have to. Smog and greenhouse gas are caused by car overuseage and hurt the enviroment and people. Limited car usage is posably the only answer to helping the world live longer aside from buying a hybrid car.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
0A5DD6EDAC68,"In years past, the number of people interested in, and using cars around the world has dropped noticibly. A marked shift in the ""car culture of the world has occured, leaving many wondering what is tocome.  Limiting car usage has many positive aspects, such as saving money, that people tend to be less stressed when they do not drive as much, and reducing pollution and greenhouse emissions.

One of the many positive aspects of reducing car usage is that one will save money if ones car usage is reduced. In an article by Robert Duffer  called ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,"" he says: ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were orderedto leave cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)."" In Paris, car-owners were charged money for using cars on certain days. This was done in an effort to reduce traffic in the city. Another article that addresses this is ""The End of Car Culture""

by Elizabeth Rosenthal. She says: ""Part of teh explanation certainly lies in the recession,  because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars..."" Cars are a costly thing, and many people cannot afford to put the money in to having and maintaining an automobile. Car cost so much,so reducing,or even eliminating usage will save anyone a great deal of money. This is one of the many advantages to limiting car usage.

Antoher reason to limit car usage is that people tend to be less stressed,and more happy when they do not have a car to worry about. In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal, she talks about Heidrun Walter, who say thatshe is actually much happier no w that she does not own a car,and that owning a car was very stressful. No one wants to be stressed,so why would people want to put themselves through the trouble of owning a car? Lowering car usage has been shown to reduce stress, which is a good thing for people, mentally and physically. Andrew Selsky also addressesthis in ""Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota,"" where he says ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress.'"" As is outlined here, rducing car usage lowers stressin many people, which is definitely an advantage.

Reducing polution and greenhouse gas emissions is another advantage of limiting car usage. carscreated emissions dangerous to the environment, so reducing usage will have a positive effect on the environment. In ""Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota,"" Andrew Selsky discusses the mayor of Bogota, Colombia's descicion to have a day free of cars in the city. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" In Bogota, as in most cities, smog from car pollution is wide-spread. Lowering car usage lowers the levels of polution and dangerous emissions in cities. A similar situation is outlined in Robert Duffer's ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,"" he says ""After days of near-record polution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This gives further evidence that reducing car usage will lower pollution and smog in cities around the world. Concurrently, Elizabeth Rosenthal, in her artilce ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" she says ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emisssions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" This provides further evidence that cars release an enormous amount of pollution, and usage must be lowered.

Limtiting ones car usage has many positive consequences, some of these include saving money, reducing stress, and lowering polution levels. These are all great reasons to limit car usage, and many people are beginning to take hold of these advantages around the world.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
740C597E4A3D,"Imagine getting off work on a Friday at five o'clock, there's no bumper to bumper traffic, no horns honking at each other, and no stressful commutes home. This is unimaginable for people who reside in the U.S., but people in parts of Europe live like that every day. There are many advantages to cutting down on car usage.

One advantage to this cut would be that you would be saving money. Many people who drive tend to get in accidents or get pulled over by police for speeding. These incidents are very costly and come with repercussions if you don't pay them. Another way you would be saving money is not having to pay for gas. Gas may be only $2.00 for now, but when those prices go on that incline again it becomes very costly to fill up the tank. If you can't afford to fill up your tank then you will be putting wear and tear on the car which leads to more more money being spent to maintnance it. Alternate transportation that's more cost efficient is taking the city bus. It costs about $1 to get from point A to point B where it would cost you about $6 in gas to get you to the same place. You could also purchase a bicycle to take you where you need to go. Maintnancing a bike is a lot cheaper than a car.

A second advantage that limiting car usage has is that it eliminates pollution. A car gives off sound, light, and air pollution which all effect our ecosystem whether you notice it or not. The U.S may not have as much air pollution as other countries but with the increase in car purchases it could get worse. I'm not saying youn have to completely get rid of your vehicles, but maybe the license plate bill may work. Every other day only license plates that begin or end with odd numbers could drive, and on the days the odds can't drive we allow the plates with the even numbers to drive. People could car pool with co-workers on the days that whoever has those plates can drive. We just need to start taking percausions on our car usage.

In the car free test cities people are overall happier because they aren't so stressed worrying about being late due to traffic or getting in an accident. Driving can be extremely stressful especially with the many things that can distract people so easily. These distractions can lead to accidents or just more stress. "" 'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way' said Heidrun Walter, mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children driwn out the distant motor.""(Source 1, Paragraph 3, Lines 4-11) This quote puts an image in my mind that is happy and stress free. Imagine how happy you would be if everything was conviently close to youer home and you could enjoy walks or biek rides places with your kids.

People should take a moment and think about ehat life without depending on cars would be like. Would you be healthier, happier, or not? Just take into consideration how you would live and be if we didn't have to rely on cars.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

i think people should be concius and start reducing their car usage becasue is only for theis benefit but for other or even something more importantr their families. car companies are going to be affected by this change. but their going to be more affective in a future when they see what they have done. not only for the human race but for theis loved members. so i think the advantages of limiting tha car usage is good in many ways but their still one factor is going to bother people like going to some places really far away to see some of theirs family members.

Some countries are starting to take cars away from some people due to their laws. In Suburb,German David Goldberg an official of Transportation for American is trying to promot new communties that is  less dependent on cars. In Paris, they banned driving due to smog. Let's not forget about Colombia who has banned cars days after days and has force people to use buses and taxis.

In German,Suburb life goes on without cars. Street parking , driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district. Vauban's streets are completely car free , but some car ownership is allowed , but there are only two places to park- large garages , car-owner can buy a space for $40,000 or at their home. some people enjoy they moment with having cars. To them it feels like less stress , and also is saving money. Vauban , home to 5,500 residents may be the most advanced experiment in low0car suburban life. For the past two decades they have been trying to make the city more denser , and better for walking. Though it's causing less stress on some people, the other half are missing their cars.

It was seven  straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. This was a good cause in Colombia. It was only to protect the people.

For all my fellow citizens new changes are coming to your countries weather you like it or not. It only for the better or in some cases the worse as well. Vauban's streets in German are now being car frees unless you somewhere to park or a home with a driveway. Paris bans driving due to smog , for safty season.

And in Colombia it was the same thing with the smog , and now with the rain. Colombia also had to protect their people as well with Paris. These advantages of limiting cars usage is now being taken serioulsy.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
693D3EA42D7D,"From the small town of Cocoa, Florida, to the busy streets of Beijing, China, driving cars is a global phenomenon. It could be said that reducing the use of cars is beneficiary to the human population. Although, some believe that the negative effects of limiting automobile usage will surely outweigh the positive outcomes. The superior argument, however, is overall, less vehicle use.

Limiting car use would be an improvement to society on a global scale. According to source 1, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This shows that the the excessive use of transportation harms the ozone layer. Even at 12 percent, the percentage will gradually increase and later will become an even more significant threat to Earth's atmoshere. According to source 4, transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants. If the numbers were reduced, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This would cause less pollution and more breathable air in the long run. The world we share will become uninhabitable if we continue in these environmental patterns.

Furthermore, there is more justification for the advantages of limiting car usage. According the source 2, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. This was due to the fact that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air five days before. The amount of time it took to air out smog that rivaled Beijing,China is an impressive factor of being fuel efficient. According the source 3, Bogota Columbia has a program where, for a day, you go around town car-free. It is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. This has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Not only does the environment become more habitable, but your physical health is improved as well.

However, some would argue that limiting vehicle use is not the route to go. According to source 2, when the Paris driving ban was enforced, delivery companies complained of lost profit. This is not completeley true since plug-in cars, hybrids, and other earth-friendly cars were unaffected by the Parisian ban. Car companies will still be in business because of the use of green cars instead of foosil fuel-powered automobiles. According to source 4, demographic research has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. This may harm the next generation as they become more dependent on alternative methods of traveling. It does not mean, however, that they won't have similar efficiency of speed and reliability with different transportations as they would now. The goverenment will have more money from public transportation to improve upon the community, and greener way. of traveling, like walking or bike riding, will create stronger immune systems and keep the majority of the population in healthy physical shape. The argument of the disadvantages of limiting car usage is somewhat counterproductive, as shown in this paragraph.

Cars, one of the less significant necessities of a well functioning society, will continue to be used. Children, teens, and adults alike will all be affected by the results of driving. We do require a method of convienient transportation for daily occurences, however, there is an extent over how much driving is sufficient to continue our everyday lives. Whatever an individual's decision may be, the amount of car usage will determine the living conditions on Earth for generations to come.    ",6,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D698ED5E6B70,"A new trend is starting to spread rapidly across America and all over Europe. This new trend is the baning of automobiles. There are many problems that come with the luxury of owning a car. Although it get you from point A to point B in your every day life, it can also be harmful. Some advantages of limiting car use is less pollution, reduced traffic jams, and lastly to come out of a recession.

To begin, pollution is a major factor that harms the earth. One of the main cause of pollution is car use. For example, China is known for the most polluted cities in the world. However, another exampe would be in France, diesel fuel was blamed becasue France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western Europe. Becasue of this, they banned the use of automoblies for the day to air out the smog. Limting polluton will allows us citzens to breathe easier and go on with our daily hetic lives. Also limting the use will, ""have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviorment, since transpotation is the second largest source of Americas emissions.""(source 4). This quote shows how beneifical limiting car use would be.

Futhermore, another main aggravating problem is traffic jams. For example in Bogota, Colombia its program was set to spread to other countries and instead of using automoblies they hiked, biked, skated , or took buses to work. Becasue of this it limits traffic jams and also cleans the air up a bit. It also allows people to walk moe freely on the sidewalks. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The violators were faced with 25 dollar fines if they did not participate in the program. "" public transit was free of charge from friday to monday, acording to the BBC."" (source 2). This was a major factor that pushed citzens to choose an alternative option.

Although, it might be reducing car production, many people are slimply not purschaing cars as they did in the past. One main reason is becasue many citzens are going through a recession. ""As of april 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" (source 4). This explanation certainly lies in the rescession becasue many Americans now-a-days can not afford new cars and the unemployed werent going to wrok anyways. By limiting car use, many citzens can then not have to always worry about gas money and the ""what if"", if they get into an accident.

To conclude, There are many advantages in limiting car use. Deomgraphic shifts in the driving population show that the trend countines to drop and the percentage or 16 to 39 year old drivers are more likey to not get or want their license. Most young people dont really care about what their ride looks like. a car is about getting from point A to point B. At this rate, soon the ""car culture"" will slow down and might clean up our earth a little more.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
236CAC008F44,"Many people believe that driving makes everything easier since it gets you from point A to point B. But so does walking or riding a bike. There are many advantages to limiting car usage all over the world. Limiting car usage not only decreases the problem of smog or greenhouse gas emission it also helps give back to the economy in different ways.

Limiting car usage helps decrease any sort of problem with smog or greenhouse gas emission. As stated in Source 2, ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(10). Since Paris decided to enforce the ban, the smog had cleared enough Monday for the French party to rescind the ban on Tuesday. Thus proving the point that limiting car usage either through a ban or just a vehicle-free zone, as in Germany, it can reduce smog and/or greenhouse gas emission. Greenhouse gas emission can be reduced simply by either switching to a more economy efficient car such as the hybrid or creating a low-car surburban society. As stated in Source 1, ""Passenger cars are resposible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""(5).Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza asserted that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution""(Source 3,24) demonstrating that more than one person agree that lowering the use of cars is good for any society.

Economy may get better but it might just all depend on whether or not society begins to limit their car usage. As car usage is decreasing, people now have time to go out and be care free. As they stop limiting themselves from just driving from one place to another, more opportunities arise. Places such as ""parks and sport centers also have bloomed throughout the city""(Source 3, 28) because people now have the time,instead of being stressed,to go have fun. Now new restaurants and even upscale shopping districts have cropped up, these places are being placed because of the restriction on driving your car. Even though it may have ""negative implications for the car industry""(Source 4,34) our economy will be boosted leaving the negative implications for car industry out of the question when it comes to advantages versus disadvantages. People will have stores within walking distance and since there will be suburbs with car-free zones it makes communication easier and faster, leaving driving places from stressing anyone out.

Everything isnt always dependent on time and if you have to work, with these suburbs containing car-free zones, stores are only a walk away instead of ""along some distant highway""(Source 1,6). As mentioned in Source 3 ""the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog""(21) and with limited car usage it is guaranteed that this will occur. Even though cars may be needed, there are many more efficient ways of achieving something without using your car. America has already joined in reducing their driving percentage by either using environment friendly cars or not receiving a license at all. Places all over the world believe the limiting of vehicles in their society supports their country thus a low-car society is what it takes to ""conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety""(Source 4, 43).

35FF346078FF,"All throughout the world, experiments are taking place that replace the personal automobile with safer and more environment sensetive choices. Life in places, such as Vauban, Germany, is built around the lack of cars. Bogota, Colombia hosts their own Day Without Cars. Although this scale of events hasn't happened America yet, the youth of the United States aren't using cars as much as they used to. In all these cases, quality of life has improved and the environment isn't suffering as much as it previously did.

The residents of Vauban, Germany have made a monumental decision in the aspect of cars. According to the article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , in the new district of Freiburg, the only cars that run in the streets are the trams that run to downtown Freiburg. This is done so that ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" This ""smart planning"" allows people to get to where they need to go without using cars. Placing busy businesses on a main street would normally be a bad idea because of the amount of congestion it would cause. In places like this, congestion isn't a thing that can happen. A walk could get you to central places allowing you to access the more important of places. The same article states that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emitions."" The envirnment is in a state of constant decline with the amount of greenhouse gasses and chemicals we are exposing to it. The lack of cars is a great way to put us in the right direction. The article mentions that cars were responsible for ""up to 50 percent [of greenhouse gasses] in some car-intensive ares in the United States."" Imagine how much clearer the sky would be with smog reduced by half. The implications of removing cars from our lives could mean the difference between severe global warming and living happy and healthy.

Three cities, deep within the Colombian urban areas, host a day where cars are not allowed. Andrew Selsky describes how ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven,pitted sidewalks; rush-hour traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" In Bogota, this singular day where cars were banned gave people a reason to try out public transportation and personal locomotion. Paris took a similar approach when, According to Robert Duffer, they ""enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of he global city."" Cars with even-numbered license plates were enforced to not be driven. The odd-numbered plates were the ones that were taken off the streets the next day. The two day ban allowed the envirnment to recover after extremely high smog levels. The rule that was applied in the Colombian cities was also enforced in the worldwide city of Paris. Both cities benefited greatly from a temporary ban of cars.

Car culture has always been strong within America. Elisabeth Rosunthal implies that for several decades, cars were a must-have object, but now, the youth are not as interested as the previous generations. Rosunthal shows how ""America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miled driven in the United States peaked in 200 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspecive."" If the largest cities stopped relying on cars as much, everybody would benefit. Even the car companies would have something to gain with advances in more personal vehicles such as bicycles. The environment would have an immense amount of weight taken off of its shoulders. In the US, where the 2nd highest source of environmental harm is cars, the impact would be monumental. The article relates that ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume hte habit."" Teens all across America are car-pooling and finding new ways to help the environment while also getting to where they need to go.

Life is getting too busy. There is always something that needs to be done. Cars may help but there will never be enough hours in the day to do everything. Leaving personal transportation behind will be the next big step towards a more relaxed and stressless life. The advantages easily outweigh the disadvantages.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Automobile drivers also have to waiste money every day in fuel, gasoline or diesel. One of the world's economy bosts is the minery and seeking of petroleum wich is destroying our soil and habitats without doubt two examples could be the minery in the Argentinia's Patagonny where many animals habitat is being destroyed by the humans and also the tragic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

Our neighborhood's should of display an augment of the buildings, like Malls or main grocery stores, reducing the parking lots to build new stores or department stores.

The County's Hall should also increase the license plate's fine. And make an encouragement plan to use the Public Transportation which is very important to the ones who can't aford a car.

Despite we would have more money after applying all this changes we could invest it in our Children's public education, the base of our future.

The best way to help our green environment is to reduce the Greenhouse Gas emissions from car's tailpipes. We are getting slowly exposed to a terrible future where everyone can get skin cancer, UV Rays burn our eyes and make us feel more tired, pulmonar cancer because of the air pollution, and other diseases. The toxic gas emited by cars every day is fading our protective Ozone Layer, this is the main cause of the extreme wheather changes that our planet is suffering. China's terrible smog is the quintisscence of the World's future if we don't change our transportation's habits.

Finally if we bost a plan to limit the car usage we can ascertain that everyone would be fitter walking and biking to work and school and we would have the lowest percentage of Car accidents, which is tragically today's main cause of death.

4EEC2BC4E65C,"Attention fellow citizens! Like most things, cars have it's advantages and disadvanteges. Cars have developed more problems from the usage on a regular basis. Limiting car use in cities can reduce the issues related to vehice usage to a minimum.

To begin, many cities have already set limitations on automobile usage such as Vauban, Germany and the outskirts of Freiburg near the Swiss and French boarders. Freiburg has actually banned cars except for the main thouroughfare and a few streets on the edge of the community.

70 percent of people in Vauban do not have a vehicle and 57 percent sold their car to move to Vauban. As we all know cars take a toll an the atmosphere itself by adding greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. 50 percent of greenhouse gasses in the United states are emited through cars, but on the other hand cars are responsible for only 12 percent. It seems to be that the car-less cities tend to be declining the negative effects in the atmosphere.

Next, Paris took the no-car rule to another level by banning all cars, depending on the day, to reduce conditions in the air quality because of the emitiones from the vehicles. A thick smof loomed over the city because of the gases produced form the automobiles. Drivers with licence plates with even numbers would not use their cars for the day and odd cars would be off the next in an attempt to redice the smog. After numerous days of reduced cars the smog began clear from it's usual state.

Also, another city that's cutting down car usage is Bogota Colombia. Bogota has created a ""car-free"" day to reduce the harmful gases created by cars and to encourage alternative forms of transportation. Anyone driving a vehicle would be fined $25. The turnout was big with many people participating showing reat results on the atmospheric conditions above the city. Another great thing that came out of this is the enthusiasm it brought to other countries who wanted some thing like this to encourage other formes of transportation and reduce pollution.

As seen in the article, limiting the time we use cars has a great impact on the environment and people around you. So what do you say? Put down the keys and ride a bike today!    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Smog flooded Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the entire world.

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages from streets being safer than ever, to totally eliminating smog that drapes over the world today.

Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and desil fuel was blamed. we the people want to stop the pollution and eliminate it once and for all so the People proposed "" A day without cars"". It's part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. This campaign has seen the construction of 188 miles of nicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to the citys mayor. Parks and sports centers have beeen packed throughout the city, Sidewalks have been redone, rush-hour restrictions have cut traffic, new and more resturaunts have been built, and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

The end of car culture has hit everywhere and id just getting to the U.S.

President Obama's goal to curb the United states' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient  shift in American behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewwer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. the essential question is "" Has America passed peak driving?""

the United states had been long one of the worlds prime car cultures. But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. when adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily after. As of april 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995.

""different things are converging which suggests that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and policy center. She cites various factors about how the internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet your friends. the renewal of centercities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. The rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexable commuting arrangements, inncluding the evolution of shared va services for getting to work.

a study last year found that driving by young peopple decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 and even car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright. ""pedestrian, bycycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emmissions and improve safety.""                            ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Not only is banning cars good for the enviroment it is also good for the well being of the human race. In the following passages ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", ""Car-free day is a big hit in Bogota"", and ""The End of Car Culture"" mention the finner points about why being ""car-free"" is benificial.

By far, Europe is once again ahead of the United States due to the fact that many countries dont use cars, but they travel to their next destination by train, tram, bus, and walikng. Unlike America, almost every one is using a car to get to their next place, and barely use a bus. According to the passage "" The End of Car Culture"" our own president of the United States is making goals to help improve the ""greenhouse gas emissions"" but just like the title suggest the end of cars are near. "" The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world's prime car cultures"" researchers are noticing a decline in the buying and selling of cars nation wide. ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate.""It has already accelerated in Europes biggest capitals the world has come to know and love.

Paris. The ""city of love"" or the city of smog, has banned driving due to record high reports of smog. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partcial driving ban to clear the air of the globla city"" according to the passage "" Paris bans driving due to smog"" smog in the ""city of love"" is not quite romantic as a city without smog. Paris alone ""... had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter..."". Banning cars and fining people is one way to help clear the air of pollution, so their is more room for love, laughter, and happiness. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals."" well maybe the smog and love can share the air. Lets travel all the way back to the Americas to see how the smog is doing there in the countyr of Colombia.

Bogota, Colombia located in South America has had its own little smog problems just like Paris. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" a whole day of either biking, hiking, skating, walking,or taking a taxi and/or bus, to get to work or school. In the Passage ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" explains to us why we should stop using cars but rather rely on our body than a 3,000 pound peice of machinerery. "" The days without cars is part of an imporvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s."". For almost 25 years Bogota, Colombia once a year celebrates a day to help reduce smog, and produce a happy, healthy, and smog free life style. ""'The rain hasnt stopped people from participating,'"" remarks Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. there may have been a few gray clouds, but that doesnt keep people form not supporting their own enviroment. Good Job to Bogota, and see what tricks Germany has up their sleeve.

Picture this: an upscale suburban community in Vauban, Germany; where soccer moms are taking there children to soccer practice, and big CEO executives are going to work. They're getting to their next destination not by car, because in this town of 5,500 people, nobody has a car because they have give up the life of ""Car Culture"". The passage ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", well truely they do. Who needs cars when you go to work by bike, train, skateboard, roller skates, or the traditional walking. ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called 'smart planning.'"" What amkes this ""smart planning"" truely genius, is that everbody is totally cool with it. For ""the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs..."". Vauban may be just an experimental suburb, but the people who live in it seem to enjoy the life without the hastle of smog producing vehicles .  ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" states Heidrum walter, a resident of the green suburban town Vaubran.

Many countries world wide have gone ""car-free"" due to either smog or maybe even banned them entirely. Countries all over the wolrd are seeing a difference in their community every day when they don't drive a car. not only is going ""car-free"" great for the reduction of smog, but you can live a happier, healthier, and stress-free life style; like most people have noitced from Bogota, Colombia to the small suburban town Vauban, Geramny.

Well in Vauban, Germany it isn't. They walk the streets without that loud roar of an engine, or the smell of fumes. You may ask, why would you not want cars on the road?

To begin with, Vehicles are giant sized moving objects with a lot of fuel spewing out. In article 1 it quotes; ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car sensitive areas in the United States."" That is an astonishing percent vehicles cause to make greenhouse gas! Is all that greenhouse gas worth to just simply move faster to where you need to be? Is your time being faster worth your life being shorter?

Have you ever heard of Smog? It's a funny word yes, but it's sickening clouds that it causes aren't anything to laugh about. Smog causes fuel clouds that can contaminate you with deadly fuels or even make you sick. In source 2 it says; They even had to out law people from driving in Paris, due to the smog clouds it built. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and many had their cars impounded due to their reactions. It's maybe not a bad thing to have your head in the clouds, but it's a terrible thing to have your fuel in the clouds.

Furthermore, Not driving a car or using transportation not only reduces smog, but it can help reduce body fat and obesity. Driving is a fast way to get to places but it's a even faster way to death. So many accidents happen each year, and so many lives have been taken due to driving. Not driving reduces deaths and obesity by a lot! Many of the problems people have today are due to obesity. Making it hard for them to work or even move because it's a hassle to carry all that weight around. Is your life living fast worth your life ending short?

In conclusion, sometimes vehicles aren't the best way to get to places. Sure it's the fastest but it's a double edged sword. You wanna live life fast, your gonna die fast. Live it slow and conservative you'll live longer. Vehicles are a pollution to our earth, and many causes of deaths.

6994BD8A5288,"The automobile is a production commonly used by individuals all over the world. But utilization of this transportation vehicle arouses environmental damage as well as stress. Limiting car usage around the world would be greatly beneficial.

Limiting automobile usage would decrease hazardous rates of air pollution in regions at which cars are commonly driven. The tailpipes of cars release toxins, often produced by the automobile's fuel, that severely pollute the environment once in the air. According to experts, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50%...in the United States""(Source 1). This amplifies the dangerous impact automobiles have on the environment. Paris, a car-using country, reached extreme levels of smog due to automobile emissions. According to Reuters, ""Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic matter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London""(Source 2). Due to this, a ban was made on car usage and the smog eventually cleared. Automobiles' emissions of greenhouse gases are utterly harmful for the environment.

Decreasing the utilization of automobiles would also ease stress levels among the community. In Vauban, Germany, cars are practically forbidden causing the suburb's streets to be free of the persistent humming of a motor. ""When I had a car I was actually tense. I'm much happier this way,""(Source 1) says Heidrun Walter, a citizen of the car-free city. This illustrates how the loss of automobiles can bring tranquility to a region. Bogota, Columbia hosts the Day Without Cars, a day where the driving of an automobile is not permitted. According to Andrew Selsky, due to this occasion, ""pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks"" and ""rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic""(Source 3). Lowering the usage of automobiles would relieve individuals of tensity caused by driving.

Automobiles are an excemplary form of transportation but their impact isn't as beneficial for other purposes. Car emissions of greenhouse gases promote global warming and traffic only tenses drivers. Limiting the utilization of these vehicles would decrease if not diminish their negative impacts on the world.                         ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

78588835BB1B,"Driving can be a huge hassle. Having to spend money on gas, making sure to not go over the speed limit, and being a safe driver at all times to avoid any accident. There are many advantages to limiting car usage. Such as helping out our economy and reducing pollution, having alternative ways to get places, and not spending money on a car. In not driving you would be the one to benefit from it.

Living in a world that constantly looked beautiful and being able to breath in clean air would be a wonderful thing. We could all make this happen by not driving so often or at all. Cars let out gases that ruin our air. Excessive driving with all the fumes coming out damages our air. Not driving can make a remendous difference. In ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" according to Duffer in paragraph 5 he described, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" After banning driving, France managed to make a stunning change.

Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. There are many alternative ways to get places. Such as riding a bus, walking, biking, and so much more. Public transportation is nothing to be afraid of. Doing so helps our community. In the passage ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" according to Rosenthal in paragraph 7 he suggests, ""'All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,' said David Goldberg, and official of transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars.""

Spending money on a car takes big bucks. There are an abundant amount of other alternatives than spending money on a car that damages the ozone. There are other ways to put your money into good use than spending it on a car. The amount of people wanting to do this could lead to negative implications for the car industry. In ""The End of Car Culture"" according to the author in paragraph 6 she implies, ""Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.""

In conclusion, there are many advantages of limiting car usage. Help not just your community, but the world. Every little thing matters, no matter how miniscule your action is. Not driving helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, saves a big part of your money, and you have alternative options for transportation. Think of the ways you will be helping our world.

E0777C202794,"Many people rely on their cars that they do not think about limiting car usage. However liming car usage can have a positive effect. Less car usage can mean less pollution, more humjan interaction, and can save people money. Maybe people should look into the idea of car usage limitations.

When you go to a big city like Paris, France or Beijing, China you can look up and see the smog caused by pollution. Pollution can be caused by things other than cars, like factories or paper mills, however car pollution is a big contributer. When car usage is limited for just one weekend the pollution and smog can decrease by incredible numbers. It may seem like pollution is here to stay, but just by half of the population reducing car usage we can make heavy smog a thing of the past.

Limited car usage can also cause more human interactions. People using public transportation or walking on the sidewalk can lead to people talking and making new friends. When waiting for the bus or subway you could start a conversation with someone new. That person could become you new bestfriend or your future husband. Maybe they could just be someone you talk to on the way to work each morning. The samething can happen when walking on the sidewalk to your favorite cafe. You could accedently run into them and start a conversation. Maybe you happen to like the same shows or restaurant. Being in your own car alone can cut you off from the world, which is why car pooling can also be good. The four people in the car are all using one car instead of four different cars, so they talk more. This causes more human interactions with everyone in a car together.

Car pooling can not only cause human interaction, but can also save money. You do not use your car everyday meaning you do not use as much gas. Gas is very expensive and not paying for it as often can save hundrends of dollars. Each person that is carpooling can switch who does it when so that not one person is paying for all of the gas and driving all the time. This makes everyone save money, which can be spent at businesses making the econemy rise.

Limiting car usage may not seem like such a big deal with only little effect, but it can make a huge difference. Limited car usage can cause less polution, more human interaction, and can save people money. This might make you rethink how much you use your car and if you should limit your usage.

DB0FC3D08205,"Limiting car usage is advantage. Many my think its not a advantage because its an easy way to get around. It may be the easiest way to get around but take the time out to think about the bad it cause. You wont be able to live some places because the wont have enough parking spaces. Where are you going to park? The diesel fuel you use to keep the car going pollute the air. Then we would have alot of bad air floatring around. Its also a problem to the traffic. Why not carpool, ride a bus, train, or bike? there are many different transportations in the world why just use one all the time?

You see, cars may be the easiest way to get around but let's study some of the bad. One reason limiting cars is an advantage is because if you don't have a car 9 times out of 10 it would be easier for you to stay anywhere. Some homing areas doesn't have enough land to make an parking lot. So if you see somewhere you would like to live without an parking lot who would probably have to find somewhere esle to live. You can slove that by just getting rid of your car. I understand that getting rid of your car would probably be the hardest thing you have ever done but look at the bright side. You would be living in the place you want to be living in.

Not only would it be easy to find somewhere to stay but also you wont have to worry about polluting the air with diesel fuel. Its crazy how you spend 3 dollars for an gallon of gas just to pollute the air. You would be better off just spending 3 dollars to catch an city bus or train. Yes they also pollute the air but if you ask me not as bad as cars. I say that that because if you think about it you see more cars than any city bus or train. why not just catch an bus or train to help our in en    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
70CAE1192018,"There are pleny of advantages fellow citizens get for having limited car usage. Fewer people are getting there license and using cars each year anyways.

in addition, it is true that people without cars would have to go through the rain or the cold weather every time the weather looks ominous and people would have to worry about getting to school or work on time. But, Limiting or taking away cars would clear the air of smog and less people would have stress.

First, by limiting car usage you can reduce smog. ""After says of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Duffer, ""Paris bans driving due to smog""). If all cars or vehicles were to stop being used the air would clear easily and we can all live in clear air. ""The smog cleard enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday""(Duffer, ""Paris bans driving due to smog""). If they made like a schedule for which days cars will be banned and what days aren't, then the air we breathe will be better than ever and everyone will still be able to use there cars how they feel like.

Last, People will become less stressful when not using a car to get to places. ""It's a good opportuntiy to take away stress and lower air pollution, ""said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle wiht his wife""(Selsky, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota""). Without cars theres people walking along the side walks talking, people not having to worry about saftey on the road as much, people riding bicycles and skateboarding, and just a great way to excerise just by walking outside. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,' said bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus""(Selsky, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota""). The fact that people dont care about the rain makes me think that people are enjoying this car-free day and there's no reason to stop it.

In conclusion, A few days or even weeks without cars is a great idea for reducing stress and air pollution. There are even more reasons why we should have a car-free day like time conservation, emission lowerage, safety improvement, and resource conservation.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F4F8050544C6,"Cars have made an impression in human history. They have been used to get from point A to B for decades. They may help us but they also can hurt us. Gas emissions are hurting the environment and smog continues to grow. Some governments have already implimented ways to reduce these emissions. These have helped the problem and it may even be to our advantage. Many cities have already sought out ways to benefit the people that have chosen npt to use their cars. This limiting of car usage has benefited many countries and the trend seems to be catching on. In the first source, Elisabeth Rosenthal writes that it has made peope even happier than if they had had a car. It has also helped reduce traffic in normally busy streets. The most obvious benefit and advantage to having limited car usage is the fact that the reduced car use has reduced gas emissions. These many advantages may make, not using your car, worth your while.

Limiting car usage can be beneficial to the environment and it can also be beneficial to you. It can make for less stressed people. In Source 1, it describes how in a small town in Germany, many people are getting along fine without motor vehicles. As a matter of fact, some even said that they were happier without a car. Heidrun Walter states that ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" It may be less stressful because the goverment there had designed that town so that everything they could need was within walking distance or could be reched with public transportation. Many cities have already adopted this idea including New York. Source 3 has also asked people of their opinion and businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It's a great opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Carlos had said this while riding a two-seated bicycle with his wife. Walking, Hiking, and even bicycling have been generally seen as a way to destress and relax your tensions. Stepping away from the car and just walking may just be the stress reliever you needed.

A usual sight to see in busy cities and on main streets is the amount of cars that jam the street alway the way up during certain hours of the day. This can become increasingly annoying to some people that can be on their way to school or job. A car-free day has had a very succesul turn out in Bogota, Colombia. Source number 3 described the streets of the capital of Colombia to be ""Eerily devoid of traffic jams."" on that day. So many people might have participated because violators would be fined $25. This car-free day was intentionally placed to promote alternative transportations such as biking or public buses and to also reduce smog. Another example of a type of car limiting was seen in Paris, France. Paris was near a record amount of smog in the air with ""147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London."" - Source 2. Paris took action to try and reduce smog with this simple method: Leave cars with even-numbered license plates at home or face a $31 fine. They proceeded on to the next day with the same concept but this time instead of even-numbered plates, it was odd-numbered plates. This reduced congestion by 60 percent in the capital of France.

One of the more obvious advantages of limiting car usage is the amount of emission that can be prevented from not using your car. In Source 2 it is stated that after 5 days of limiting car usage ""the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescing the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" After just five days of the imposed fines, gas emissions into the atmosphere was reduced significantly enough to lift the ban. If five days made such an impact it can also make a huge impact if many more people were to start limiting their car usage. Car usage has already been falling in the United States. In source 4 it states that ""New York's new bike sharing program and its skyrocketing brdge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorites, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation."" This is talking about how all these factors have come to reduce car sales and car usage in general. Less cars equals less gas which would then equal less air pollution.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting your car usages. You may not only be helping the environment but you may also be helping yourself. Using your car less may even make you a less stressed individual. It has been shown to reduce congestions in busy streets. It has also helped reduce gas emission. Limited car usage has started a trend in many countries and may even be a trend here. It can give us these advantages and many more.                            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
27E91D36D421,"The automobile has been a staple in human history ever since it was first  created, they have been used by people wether it was grocery shopping or during war. These days limiting car use has more advantages than ever. Such advantages are that it helps reduce the amount of pollution to the enviorment, helps people save money, aswell as it helps people become more sociable and less stressed.

The limiting of car usage has many advantages one would be that it helps to reduce pollution cuased by fuel emissions. Using vehicles creates green house emissions which cause the Earth to become hotter and then global warming becomes a big problem. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."" by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive area in the United States. So limiting car usage reduces the amount of emissions produced greatly. Smog is also a great threat to the enviorment, smog is created just like fog except polluted air gets into the mix of warm days and cold nights. Then instead of getting fog there is smog a more dense unhealthy version of fog. Paris has had a rough time when  it came to smog which according to ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer resulted from the fact that ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France.

Saving money is a big plus to the resriction on car use. With more buildings and shopping centers being built closer to suburban area makes walking a good way to save money. Andrew Selsky author of the article ""car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" made a comment on the situation in Bogota saying ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city- new resturaunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"". With more shopping centers for people to be able to reach by foot, bike, car-pool, or bus can greatly reduce the amount people spend on gas and car repairs.

Limiting the usage of cars also in a strange way helps people become more connected with each other. Limiting car use will alow people to hang out more in things such as carpooling, bike rides, walking, public transportation. Allowing for people to meet more people. Also it wil allow people to use things such as social media to stil feel connected to thier freinds without having to drive out to meet them. In another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""The End of Car Culture"" Rosenthal interviewed professor Mimi Sheller Who stated ""the rise iin cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arranments,includiong the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. The restriction on car usage allows for people to meet new people through the carpool service and such things.

A limitaion on car usage would have so many advntages to people and the enviorment. It helps reduce the amount of pollution from fuel and carbon emissions, helps people save money and not need a car to get to a store or park, and have people become more connected to each other.

30CA7D9DB52B,"There are many differant reasons to limit car usage, the most well-known reason being that it will greatly reduce air pollution. Several places incuding Vauban Germany, Paris, Bogota Colombia, and the United States have proven this, especially Paris. Paris at one point in 2014, had to enforce a partial driving ban purely because of the hazzardous smog caused by air pollution. In doing so Paris relatively quickly cleared the majority of the smog, and realized how this can also help to reduce road congestion. The United States are another, larger example of how much limiting car use can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Another good reason for limiting car usage would be that it will generally reduce stress in people. Limiting or lowering the usage of automobiles anywhere can help reduce stress mainly because people won't have to worry as much about traffic, maintanence & repair costs, air polution, or even the general dangers of driving a vehicle. Almost everyone knows that less stress is a good thing because of how it helps your health, therfore, limiting how much you drive is will not only improve your health by reduceing how stressed you are, but it will also help you to be healthier because it reduces the overall polution in the air.

So in the end limiting automobile/car usage will be advantagous for the earth, and every country or nation on it because of how it reduces stress, promotes health, and reduces greenhouse emmisions around the world.              ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

There is a city in Germany, Vauban. This city is almost completely devoid of cars. How do they do it? Well most of them ride bikes, or simply walk. If there is a distance to far for biking or walking, there is also a tram that runs through the city. The people who live in this city seem to be incredibly happy ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now""

The beneifit of going car-free, goes beyond making people happier, it might even save the human race. Global warming is a major problem. Though an even bigger problem, is that most people in the US do not believe that global warming even exists. One way that scientists know that global warming is happening, is by looking in the ice of the artic. By drilling deep holes in the artic, scientists can extract tubes of ice millions of years old. Just how you can tell how old a tree is by counting its rings, you can tell how old ice is by doing the same thing. When scientists tested the amount of Co2 in a sample of ice that was formed 50 years after the industrial revolution, then compared it to the level of  Co2 in a tube of ice 50 years before the industrial revolution. They saw a remarkable increase in Co2 levels after the industrial revolution. Many people do not know, but mercury looked a lot like earth a billion or so years ago. Now mercury is a desolated wasteland, thanks to the amount of volcanos spewing Co2 into the atmosphere. A similar phenomena is happening all over the world in places like Paris and China. Paris' pollution was so bad, that they had to ban driving for a couple days ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine""

In Bagota, Columbia, people take part in a car-free day in order to reduce smog. ""Millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday""

This is another example of people taking the initiative to give up cars, even if its only for one day.

People are finally staring to realize that cars cause pollution to the Earth. Even the president is backing the cause, which honestly might be why more people have not accepted global warming as a fact. The level of driving has decreased over the years ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995""

(Source 4)

It is fantastic to know that people are finally embracing science as something to learn from, and not something to fear.

Why drive someplace that's down the street, when you could save the gas and money and walk, or maybe even ride a bike? All around the world people use cars to their advantage and even though it seems like just a little ride around the block, it's really making more pollution spread out into the air. Vauban,Germany has made the decision to ban all cars. There are two ways to keep your car: by buying a parking lot space down town, $40,000, along with a home; or large car garages at the edge of the development.

Taking away stress is another advantage for giving up your car. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walking doesn't add pollution to the air. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases emissions in Europe; and up to 50  percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Bikes and scooters have the same effect as a car, just with less pollution. Just by riding a bike you are not only not sending out pollution, you are getting a free workout. Just by even car pooling you are saving your country from being overthrown by polluted air.

""All of our development since the World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Golberg, an official of Transportation for America, ""How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.""

In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

The car is one way to get around town, to travel, to car pool. However, with one less car we could change the way we live in the future.

From there, it steadily dropped to, as of April 2013, nine percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. This decrease has had positive effcts, though. Limiting car usage saves time, improves safety, conserves resources, and causes more social interactions with people.

Recent studies suggest the Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Still, in places like paris, cars are still causing polution. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Because of this ban, congestion went dow 60 percent in the capital of France. By haveing fewer cars out on the streets, it lowers rates of traffic and the time it takes people to get to work. Also, in result of a decrease in traffic, there would be less accidents and less lives lost to motorvehicle collisions.

France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel over gasoline results in higher percent of people using diesel vehicles. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engins in the rest of Western Europe. By cutting back on car usage, the world would save an astronomical amount of resources. If people stopped bying cars, there would be less production of them. Thus conserving the metal, as well as other materials, used to make the cars.

""When I had a car I was always tense.

By walking, or even taking public transportation, you get the chance to run into people you know or meet new people.

Time saving, improvement on safety, conservation of resources, and more social face-to-face interactions can be accomplished by limting car usage. The decrease in the percentage of miles driven in the United States from 2005 to 2013 proves that people are starting to understand this.

Filling your tank up will cost you around $60 or more. In my eyes, it's cheaper to take public transportation than to drive. While taking the bus or the train , all you really have to do is wait , pay to get in, find your stop, if your destination is a little farther, there can be another bus and you'll be at your stop. On the other hand, Driving, your worrying more. Your worried about if you have gas, is there a traffic jam, why is this driver driving so slow. You're getting fustrated rather than taking the public transportaion. In Colombia there is this program where you dont drive for a day. ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams""(Source 3). Not only did it cause a less stressful day, it allowed them to get some exercise.

Furthermore, I have a question. How many people like smoggy days? No one. Reason I asked this specific question is mainly because if you enjoy driving, you must enjoy the smog. ""After days of near-record polution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Source 2). Although Paris has more smog than other European capitals, it isnt good for our very own health, but it isnt good for our planet either. When Paris did this ""No Driving"" campigan, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after 5 days of intensifying smog""(Source 2).

On the other hand, driving isn't really important as it used to be. We have all these technological advances, that honestly make driving not necessary. We all have a cell phone, we can all video chat. Some work together, some go to school together. We all can car-pool. There was this quote that I read, and after doing some thinking, it made me realize that driving isn't really important as it seemed to be. ""How much you drive is as important as whether you have an hybrid""(Source 1). Hybrids save alot of wrong doings that we already do to this Earth. Along with eletronic cars. Driving a hybrid, yes it's saving the world but your still causing traffic, and wasting money. Some people have already quit driving. ""With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit."" (Source 4). America has went so far into the stopping of driving that on highways there's more tolls. Tolls that we can't pay to another person, tolls where they take a picture of your license, find out you information, and send you the amount you owe through the mail. Each toll is different some can be 75 cents or a $1.50. From your home to the mall, depending where you live, you'll pass by more a less 5 tolls. In total thats around I'll say $3.75 or $7.50. Public transportation saves you more money. Mall's have buses where it picks you up from a specfic location to the mall and back. That's saving you time and your money.

In conclusion, limiting car usuage can be an advantage to both young, old and even to our very own planet Earth. It can help our economy, save our pollution rate, but also help us lose the weight. Now its your turn, Are you willing to make the change ?    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
52F4E96E8282,"Using cars creates admissions that damages our ozone layer. Communities around the world know this and are doing something to relax the damage being done. They are doing temporary bans on cars along side with other cities, and trying to make cars with much lower emissions.

Using cars in major cities makes it so noisy but also makes it very bad for the environment, and ourselfs. When you live in a major city like for example New York City, people choose to walk rather than drive cars. Not only is this healthier for us but it is much more healthy for the rest of the environment.

In suburban Germany there is a town that has banned cars from the street completely and has most people riding bikes and walking. Most of these people dont really car so much about having to walk or ride a bike. In Colombia they had one day where they banned cars and in their city of 7 million people, most people walked or rode bikes. Germany and Paraguay arent the only nationd that are taking a part of this, other nations like France, and other eurpoean countries are joining in. President Obama has also pushed for cars with lower emissions and higher gas mileage. This will help save people money if they dont really have it, and help save the amount of gas used and emissions caused.

With all this in mind it would be useful to lower gas emissions or even to stop using cars in general. It will be healthy for us and the environent. We dont even have to get rid over cars completly either, we can just switch over to electric. Theses are easy solutions to our problem, and also giving us and advantage in the world we live in.

In source one the German Suburbs are car free, where street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbiden generally. Car ownership is allowed, however where a car-owner buys space for their car has to pay near $40,000, along with a home. As a result according to source one 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars , and 57 percent sold a car to move here. Many citizens complain when the gas prices go up, but if we limit our car ussage we wont have to complain anymore. We will save money, because when we decrease the usage of cars we wont use as much gas or deisel. Heidrun Walter told Elisabeth Rosenthal that he now lives happier this way. Not only do we save money but we also relieve tension through out our bodies.

However we may not enjoy this new idea of limiting car usage some of us actually enjoy driving but, there are days where after a long day of working the last thing you want to be in is in traffic jams.""It's a good opporunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman named, Carlos Arturo Plaza who rides a two seat bicycle with his wife.

In other ways that limiting car usage could help us is by eliminating pollution, of course everyone enjoys breathing in fresh air. By limiting car usage we can help lower polution. According to source two,"" After days ofe near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,"" the usage of car produced so much smog that they had to ban driving. Many of use drive to so many places that are near by that in reality we dont really have to use our car not only will we reduce pollution, but we will also maintain ourselves fit by using different alternatives like, walking, running, ridding our bikes. Although some may say, "" what if its an emergency,"" its fine we're only limitting car usage, we aren't goining to ban it forever.

If we limit car usage we can not only save money, but we can also reduce polution, and have a better lifestyle. Although these aren't the only ways limiting car usage can benefit us.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
2F4472762011,"When one thinks of transportation, the first idea that springs into a persons mind would be a car. A car is used almost daily for many people. It helps us get to point A to point B rain or shine. However, complications arise from the use (or overuse) of cars. The advantages of limiting car usage includes reduction in pollution, promote public transport, and cut off traffic.

Pollution has become a growing problem as the world continues to industrialize. The greenhouse gases emitted by machines, such as cars, have been proven detrimental to the enviornment. In car-dense citites, smog, a mixture of smoke and fog, has become a nuisance as it covers cities. In extreme cases,it makes the air citizens breathe toxic! According to Source 1, "" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."". To establish limits to car usage would then, therefore, reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and clear up conditions not only for the world, but make the over-all city more enjoyable to live in. In order to reduce pollution and clear the air, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the international city. Source 2 states that "" The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescing the ban..."" proving that limiting car usage benefitted the city and the enviornment as well.

Reduction of car usage would lead to the promotion of public transportation. Public transport was free of charge during the ban in Paris which stated was a success in reducing pollution. Limiting car usage would then correlate in the promotion of public transport which, according to Source 4, ""...public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions [of greenhouse gases] and improve safety""  This not only benefits one's safety and environment but allows time-efficient traveling as buses and other public transport run along a contiuous schedule. Public transport also produces carpooling, which allows the reduction of cars on the road. This also eliminates a distributor in the production of greenhouse gases within the atmosphere which benefits the world.

Limiting car usage will take one annoying factor from our daily lives-- traffic. As a suburban citizen living in Florida, traffic has become a daily nuisance of mine, one that not only is frusterating but stressful. It wastes time that I need to invest in being somewhere of importance. Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up their cars in their experimental new district near the French and Swiss borders. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" In Paris, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" during their ban in response to reduce pollution. This would make the lives of many citizens much more happier and time efficient as there are no worries about arrving late to an area of importance!

Limiting car usage in many large cities accross the globe is not impossible, it has been done successfully in globally impactful cities such as Paris. This reduction of cars will not only benefit a community or a city, but the whole world! It will reduce pollution, promote the usage of public transport and carpooling and cut down on the rush-hour traffic leaving condtions in cities much more enjoyable to live in.

BA3FE730FAD4,"Driving a car around can be very a affective aspect in people's lives; it can also be a very stressful and dangerous life-risking task to do each and every day. All across America, citizens are constantly driving their cars. A car can be used to go to work, to the grocery store, or to drop a loved one off to school and even other places. It is to the point were a simple car has become an important necessity to manage everyday life. It is also to a point at which every year cars are responsible for thousands of deaths and accidents. If people around the world limited their car usuage everyday it could significantly better our lives.

Clear the air. Pollution from cars has serverely polluted the air we breathe and our enviornment. Beijing, China is know as one of the most polluted cities in the world and has been effected my the smog. Many places around the world are trying to make a difference in their envoirnment by trying to get citizens in that area to limit their driving. According to an excerpt from ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, Paris has enforced a parital driving ban to help clean the air of the global city. As stated in the excerpt, ""On Monday motorist with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" Just because of that one action congestion in the capital of France was down 60 percent and as time goes by the air will start to clear up faster.

If one had the opportunity to take away stress while lower the air pollution, would the do it? In Bogota, Colombia once a year millions of Columbians take part in a day without cars know as car-free day. As stated the the article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky the goal of the car-free day is to promote alternative transportaion and reduce smog. Many citizens of Colombia take advantage of the day by hiking, biking, skating or taking buses to work, which benefits one's health and is a great source of excersize. Because of this day many parks and sports centers have opened, sidewalks have been replaced, and rush-hour restrictions have created a better flow in traffic.

Putting away something you constantly use everyday can be a difficult thing to do but it is worth it in the end. Minimizing the use of cars can greatly reduce the amount of polluion of the air. If we all comply with is task year by year our air will get cleaner and the enviornment will be better.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Bogota, Colombia had a huge turnout on free-car day. The goal is to reduce smog violators and promote alternative transportation. Even in America, recent studies show fewer cars are being bought and less driving each year goes by. MIcheal Sivak said ""I think that means something more fundamental is going on.""

In Germany residnets in the suburban area are buying fewer cars. In this one community they are completely car free. The community is near the french and swiss borders. The surburban life is being adopted by public transportation with less space for parking and more space for stores and walk ways on main streets.

Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Motorists with odd or even license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home and if they did not listen they would be fined 22-euro ($31 dollars). Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Even though Paris has more smog than any other European capitals. The smog cleared on monday and for the ruling the French party banned odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took the buses to work on free-car day. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce their smog aswell. The turnout was large despite the gray clouds and rain. The day still went on has free-car day. Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution and they have done just that.

In America recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This is good and bad. Only because the pollution rate is dropping and that is a good thing but the bad thing is the American car ownerships  are losing money. In New York the new bike-sharing program is skyrocketing because of the fewer cars being sold. The end of car culture is coming to an end and the time to change for the better is coming.

25DFB3398EE3,"In today's society, most people believe that having a car is essential to everyday tasks. In their definition, everyday task can range from going food shopping to going to work in the morning. Some, on the other hand, consider everyday tasks to be checking in on friends just to showcase their new car. Although that may or may not be the mindset of many, people fail to realize there are other ways of reaching from point A to point B, without harming the environment and it's people. Limiting car usage not only benefits the person who is using the car, but their community and environment.

The use of a car isn't, at all, important in everyday use. Instead of using a car, which helps build up the problem of air pollution, one can simply walk, take a bike or even use public transportation. Just like Bogota, several countries should participate in a ""Car-free day"". Spreading awareness, that a car isn't always needed to move around an area, can help to benefit the people and the environment. As said in source 3, ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"", bringing awareness of more easy and effective public transportation,which can help to rid that particular country of the usage of cars. Once participants of this car-free day understand the effects they are having upon the air pollution, they would be much more willing to help with this process just like businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza, ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". Overall the usage of cars doesn't benefit the environment. Sooner, rather than later, it is important that we realize this problem and fix it before it's too late for our community.

Not only is the usage of a car terrible for our environment, it is also not needed as how it was. ""The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005"", during this time, many vehicles were purchased with a high demand and were considered to be popular, although that isn't the case anymore. As years went past, the number of miles began to drop steadily. ""Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars"", that may be the case for some, but for others they didnt feel it was necessary to own one. In German Suburbs, ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"", providing this area with no need for a car. Since everything was so near, a car was a waste of thought. If they did own cars, they would have to pay for both the car and a means of where to park the car. Those expensies were usually ""40,000, along with a home"", much more money than a free walk to any of your local stores. With the hopes of limiting the usage of cars, comes the need for expanding Vauban-like suburbs. With that being said, according to the article, these suburbs need to be expanded ""not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are chocking cities"".

To sum it up, the limiting of cars is becoming important in the development of the new world and the fixation of the old. As of now, cars consist of having no benefit for the environment and of certain communities. As days go on and more people become aware of the means of public transportation, hopefully there won't need to be any cars. To take action in this plan, more Vauban-like suburbs need to be put in place to give off the same react. Although some people understand the full effect of a car on the environment, it is critial that nearly every person understands.

3A5B045A529B,"The Beginning Of A Car-Free World

Cars are an integral part of society today, from the hustling bustling cities to far out in the countryside, these machines can be found everywhere, but lately there has been a new trend spreading across the modern world: The limitations on cars.

The use of cars is steadily decreasing throughout the Americas and Western Europe. Germany home to the most advanced car-free suburban community VAUBAN. VAUBAN is the pinnacle of modern car-free suburban living, the new area lies just outside of Freiburg, providing a near complete self sufficient way of living, without relying on the use of cars. As the case with most suburban residences, getting to and from the urban cities is nessessary due to the need to restock food and get to work. In the case of this city it has significantly reduced the emitions from vehicles via public transport and the erection of several shops, just walking distance from the community.

Due to the smog caused by the rise of pollution by the emitions of vehicles, Paris made an attempt to ban cars from its streets, alternating between even numbered and odd numbered liscense plates. The ban sparked outrage among the citizens over the strictness of the ban, but the effects were worthwhile as the smog had cleared up enough for the ban to be lifted.

The limitations on carsare not just restricted to Europe, the Americas have also taken an intrest in reducing the pollution caused by cars. In 2002 BOGOTA, Colombia, for the third year in a row had a day completely devoid of cars. The participants, all of Bogota's 7 million citzens, used seperate means of transportation to cut the emitions released by cars, only permitting the use of buses and taxis as vehicular transportation.

In the U.S. the use of cars is on the decline, with the number of miles driven per person dropping 9% as of April 2013 to record lows scince January 1995. This decrease is caused in part by the recovering economy and the arrival of new methods of keeping in touch. The executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, Bill Ford, has proposed a plan to create a world where the personal ownership of a vehicle would be in his words ""impractical and undesirable.""

In this new age of awareness to the effects of pollution and the means to fight against them, these limitations may be the first steps on a long journey to the restoration of our planet.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

As it was said on these sources it is helping with environment, families etc. Families have said that they really like the new ""trend"" of not using your car or motorcycle on a specific day. This specific days have been established by a few groups around each of the places that it has been happening.

Cars in this time period have become a problem but at the same time it has good qualities. Teens are being allowed to drive without a license causing major accidents to others and themselves. But cars transport us where we need to be in a faster and easier way. Cars are a useful tool but only if it is used in the right way.

The government has provided states to have different options for transportation like: the bus and the train. This useful ways to transport have helped the ""Car-free"" event. This transportation methods may take longer but they take a larger amount of people to their destinations and not as much pollution is caused.

Evidence from this article says that mom's liked the idea of taking walks to go grocery shopping or any other place. The buildings have been built closer so the time the person has to walk is not a long one. If the day of the event you violated the rules which are to not drive your car you would get a fine. In other states they arranged it by saying that only even license numbers could go out and use their car on a specific day assigned if you were to get caught violating the fine was going to be 22-euro fine ($31).

In Germany, there were some different rules when you were to buy your house, in the overall price, you had to pay for your parking $40,000. Home garages are forbidden so are street parkings and driveways. THe only place that is not car-free is ""downtown where Freigburg runs"". Cars are allowed to be owned by someone but there are only two places where you could park which is the parking you pay for when buying your house. This has caused Vauban's families to not own cars at all.

In the United States, President Obama has asked: "" has america passed peak driving?"" this is due to the results from the age of 16- to 39-years-old, the percentage of people getting their license dropped. Now they are not even bothered or in an urge to get it.

So I'll tell you about the advantages of not using a car and how these places in the world are handiling a problem such as is.

To begin with, in place like Vauben, Germany where the streets are completly ""car-free"" generally don't allow street parking, driveways, and home garages. 70% of the Vauben people do not own car. People who live here tend to be generally happy without having to ride a car everyday and constantly needing one where ever they go. There has been attempts in the past two decades to make cities dencer and better for walking and whatnot. A place like Vauben may have been like the most ""advanced"" eperiment in the usuage of cars in life.

In addition to Vauben being a ""car-free"" place. Paris a completly different place where there's a lot of car usuage from what I know. After a near record breaking record. Paris had created a small driving ban. So they can clear the air and freshing it. Motorists with even numbered licence plates were made to leave their vehicles at home and if not they would suffer a 22 euro fine. I'd imagine that there would be a lot of people fined that day and there was... Almost 4,000 dummys were fined. Thankfully at the end, the smog had cleared enough on Monday. Even in United States they are trying to make ""car reduced"" communities. Which is a very good idea to me.

835DF70D576F,"Car emissions are very deadly and dangerous. They can be lethal to humans, and also dangerous to the enviroment. It can lead to big enviromental issues like global warming, holes in the ozone, and air pollution. Many ignore the fact or are oblivious to it, but driving hurts our enviroment just for a little bit of convienence. Are cars doing more harm than good?

Cars have a convienent way of getting us to our destination faster but at the cost of our precious enviroment. We use our cars sometimes without thinking twice of what the actual after effect is. Paris is a city that has had almost, if not the worst, smog levels in all of europe. It has 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter due to the majority of cars which have diesel powered engines. Air pollution doen't jsut effect our atmosphere, it slowly kills, if not severly injuers, animals and people. It hurts us by causing major damage to our lungs and respitory system.

Greenhouse gases are another major thing in car emissions. Greenhouse gases are gases that keep or trap heat on earth to keep us from going into another ice age. A decent amount is good and is used to do its job, but when you have too much then the globe starts to increase in temperature. Antarctica, as you know, is made of ice. when ice gets to a certain temperature it starts to turn into a liquid. So when antarctica starts to melt into the sea, the general ocean level will rise, causing sea level cities, states, and countries start to flood with salty ocean water. If we cut down on gas or diesel car travels, the and greenhouse production rate would slow down and so will the rising temperature of the earth decreasing the speed of the melting arctic.

Cars are a very important and convienent way of travel but can be very deadly to us humans and tne earth we live on. Because we use them everyday doesn't mean that we can not cut down or change our ways of transpertation. Cars give off many harmful toxins and gases that we can, but refuse to control. we can cut down on the majority of the waste by limiting our car trips distance wise and based on how many times you leave the driveway. a simple change as in riding a bike or walking or even only going out when needed can slow down the speed of global warming and even drop the levels of air pollution. A little change can maybe just save the earth from another flood that can wipe out humainity.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Even outside of the United States there are efforts being made; in Germany, France, and Colombia. In Gernamy, some people have ended up selling their cars, and started living a whole new lifestyle. Moved into car-less communities with others, and now live supposedly happier lives. A city in Columbia, officially has a car free day, to try and cut down on emissions and help reduce the stress of driving, also those who do not go along with it are fined. So, maybe life with less cars can actually be beneficial to many of us.

In the city of Vauban, Germany there is a suburb that was finished around 2006. Its goal was to limit the use of cars. So far it seems successful in its purpose; where 70% of the families living there do not have cars, and at least 57% sold a car to live in that suburb. For the most part, there is no driveways, garages, or street parking so it is mainly car-free except for the ""main thoroughfare"" being the tram to downtown. Proof that not only the idea was beneficial, but it was also ""inspirational"" is that places like Vauban, are growing more and more in Europe, and the U.S. has the EPA (Evironmental Protection Agency) promoting these car reduced communities, and legislators are now starting to act upon it. It is also becoming a part of a movement called ""smart planning"". The idea also is to make cities denser so more people can live, and easier for walking. To make things closer, so getting there is not such a hassle; epecially if you don't have a car.

After near-record polution in Paris, the city enforced a partial ban on car use to help clear the city's air. On Monday, morotorists with an even numbered plate were told to leave their car come, or be fined. and on that Tuesday, people with odd numbered plates would have to do the same. Because of that, nearly 4,000 people were fined. And 27 people had their cars impounded due to the way they acted upon being fined. Though it left some unhappy people, it did help; the congestion was down by 30% in the city.

The City of Bogota, Colombia has started a car-free day. And apparently it's a big hit. Its goal is to promote alternate transportation, and reduce smog, with the exception of buses and taxis. That day, millions of Colombians either walked, hiked, biked, or skated. And even though there was some gray clouds with a bit of rain, it didn't stop many people. It is also seen as an opportunity to help lower stress and air pollution. And to show its popularity, two other cities in the county; Cali and Velledupar have joined in on the event. Even the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay came to the county to say how great of an idea it was. More parks, sports centers have been buit, and 118 miles of bike paths have been created. On top of that, new side-walks have been built to help people in general.

With all of the effort that so many countries have put out towards making a better environment for themselves, I hope you would be able to see why they did it, because I do. When it comes to making communities with car restrictions, or a day or two when use in limited it all helps. So Maybe I could convince you to reduce your car use, and improve your life.

Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in places in the U.S.

Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s, and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more like the German town of Vauban, not only in developed contries, but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars, owned by the burgeoning middle class, are choking cities.

In the U.S, EPA (the Environmental Protection Agency) is promoting car reduced communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect that the public transport serving suburbs, will play a much lager role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, In previous bills, eighty percent of appropriations have by law, gone to highways, and only twenty percent to other transport.

After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

On Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home, or suffer a 22-euro fine (31 dollars). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the next day.

Almost 4000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters (an international news agency), 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. That's easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees (a famous street in Paris).

Congestion (car traffic), was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five-days of intensifying smog. the smog riveled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities it the world.

Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals. Last week, Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter, compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday-Monday, according to the BBC.

The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.    ",1,Car-free cities,Text dependent
8656B92829A6,"Should we give up our cars in order to live a better life?

That's the question on everyones mind right now , but it's a no brainer! Places all over the world have done this as an experiment and it seems as if they like the results. Here are a few key points from passages that will help persuade you into joining the idea of getting rid of cars.

Vauban, Germany has given up their cars for a better and healther life. So many families in Vauban have given up their cars that 70 percent of them don't even own a car! The reason why Vauban did this is because they realized that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and more than triple that amount in car-intensive areas in the United States. Looking on the bright side of this since there is less space for parking stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. If you want to drive a car you can always buy a small area for $40,000 that also comes with a house where you can park the car which would have to be a hybrid.

Paris did the same thing that Vauban did but in a different way. On Monday mototrist with even- numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Of course there were people who didn't obey the new law and where fined and some even had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine; however, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. The only exceptions were plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers since they didn't really affect the pollution as much as cars that use up a lot more gas. Doing this cleared the smog for some time in Paris, in fact, so much of the smog cleared that the French party was actually able to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

Instead of making a law

BOGOTA, Colombia , created a program called car-free day where millions of Colobians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work or to do whatever they had to do. The goal of this program was obvious, to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog (Violators faced $25 fines). For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event of having no cars except for taxis and busses. By Bogota doing this the parks and sports centers have seen and highly approved of this idea and have turned uneven, pitted sidewalks into broad, smooth sidewalks. Along with the new improvements, new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have appeared.

In conclusion, getting rid of cars permitly or even just for a day or a week seems like a good idea. Lots of the people mentioned above highly approve of this and say that it actually makes them a lot happier and stress free. Of course the people who don't approve of this idea are the ones who were fined for driving on a no drive zone. All in all i still recommend this idea if things in Florida start to get out of hand and we must resort to something.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
61892074B644,"In cities such as Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, people are getting serious about cutting down on the vast usage of cars. The ""car free"" trend is beginning to spread throughout the world, and even to places in America. By limiting car usage, the state of the environment improves, a more healthy lifestyle is promoted, and opportunities for other innovations are brought into the light.

In Paris, a driving ban was enforced to help clear the air of polluants. This ban lowered the congestion by 60 percent, and according to reporter Robert Duffer, ""The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gasses in Europe, and up to 50 percent in areas where cars are used more often, such as the United States. The Environmental Protecion Agency is promoting car reduced communities in America, where even legislators are beginning to act. By elimitating cars from the everyday equation, one also eliminates the greenhouse gasses and other pollutants, which makes the planet a healthier place to live.

With less and less cars being utilized, there are more opportunites for people to get active by biking, walking, and participating in other active means of getting from point A to point B. According to news reportes Andrew Selsky and Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occassional distant moter"", and ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks."" Without cars, citizens are encouraged to get active. Condensed cities allow people to walk to their destination, which drastically improves an individual's heart health, along with aerobic activity such as biking.

An official from Transportation for America says, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Sociologists believe that America has passed peak driving, and cars are no longer the focus of improvement. The Internet makes telecommuting possible, which is much more convenient than using automobiles because people can feel connected without the drive. This and the rise in cellphones implies that while innovations used to be focused on transportation, telecommuting is the new big thing.

With many areas participating in the eventual elimination of automobiles, many are following suit. Sociologists believe that cars will eventually disappear. By cutting down on our usage of cars, we help the enviromnent, promote health, and focus innovations elsewhere.                                                    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F5351F4B44FD,"Reducing the usage of cars in today's world could be extremely beneficial. Sure, it is also a hastle having to re-route your commute and also making the time to get there, but the myriad advantages to the reduction of car usage is astonishing. Reducing our usage of cars will reduce the smog in cities, such as Los Angeles, Beijing, and Paris, reduce the stress of many drivers, and also save people money. Now who doesn't love money?

Smog/pollution is growing daily in dense, polluted areas. Looking outside of LA, you can see the dirty, polluted air surrounding the city, as well as the toxic blanket the covers Beijing. One of the main sources contributing to this is cars. Greenhouse gases are emitted from tailpipes and go straight into the atmosphere. In Europe, exhaust makes up fifteen percent of greenhouse gas emission, and accounts for fifty percent in the United States, FIFTY PERCENT. That's half of the pollution in our country, and an easy solution is to limit car usage. If your car usage is not limitable, perhaps switching to a hybrid car such as a Toyota Prius will make you feel good about contributing to the cause. Some areas, like Bogota, Colombia, participate in a Car-free Day. This day is widely celebrated in the area and is infectiously spreading to nearby areas and potentially the world soon enough. This day allows for smog reduction. Cities such as Paris, however, have to ban car usage sometimes because their smog is so bad. During this ban, hybrid cars and carpooling is allowed. This shows the extreme measures necessary to reduce the smog in populated areas.

As most people know, driving is stressful and is perhaps a top contributer of stress in America. In populated areas, rush-hour traffic is annoying and causes many people to change their schedules. When driving during rush-hour, you are in constant fear of potentially being cut-off and your risk of being in an accident heightens dramtically. With that being said, what if I told you there was a way to completely cut out this fear? Communities such as Vauban, Germany are helping alleviate stress by making car-free communities. Within these communities, cars are allowed to be owned, but you must park it in a parking garage at the end of the community and also buy a spot... for $40,000. Cars are used rarely, as restaurants, shops, and others are within walking distance of these communities. Cars are only used for long-distance travel and are permitted on highways and on the outer edges of the area. The stress is alleviated because you can walk outside, grab your mail, and listen to the birds if want, all without the worry of cars. You don't need to constant check your rear-view mirrors if you're walking to your favorite restaurant. With the introduction of smartphones and the constantly growing usage rate of the internet, people don't need cars to communicate anymore. They can simply go on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. to communicate.

Finally, the reduction of car usage allows for people to save money, and a significant amount too. If you live in a neighborhood such as Vauban, there may be no need for a car at all. In today's world, a good car costs somewhere are 30-40 thousand dollars. Imagine what you could do with that much money. You could get a nice house, or travel to your favorite destination, or anything really. You could send your kid to a nice college! And the drawbacks are small, because everything is within a twenty minute walk. That sounds pretty nice to me.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
18E303B05F39,"there are many advantages of limiting car use the most important is for our health. by limiting car use we decrease the gas emissions ,also make the stores closer to you than across a huge highway,another reason is that it reducies smog build up many places are doing this for the health or maybe they just cant afford it .

many places in the world are starting to ban cars places like paris,colombia, and germany. in some places its be couse of the cost in vauban, germany it cost up to 40,000 for a car space and a house so many people just have a house not a carman y peolpe like it like this they say it takes stress away. this also helps with gas  emissons in europe. in europe up to 12 percent of gas emissions  are resposeable by cars and up to 50 in gas emissons.

many peole also like this becuase it makes the stores closer to the poeple since not many people have cars they cant travle far so stores start setting up close and nearby. this also makes more space fore sidewalks and houses insted of stores. this aslo helps with your health beause it incuages iyou to wal kmor insted of taking a car every where.

in places like paris car have really effected the population there are so many peolple that it creates smog so what the peole did was they gave fines out to people that were driving on days they couldnt this brought 4,000 drivers to get fines 31$ and 27 to get ther car impounded. by stoping and lowering the amount of drivers they brouht congestion down by 60 percent and made the smog subside in bogota colombia they have got three straight years without cars there goal was to promote other means of transpotation. by doing this peole have made up to 118 miles of bike pathe and many parks for the public.

these are some but not all the ways that puttin limitations on cars could benifit us by redising smog and the green house gases bing released in to the air and by making stores more accesibale to peole with out cars and making a impact on our health.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
DCDE7152B94E,"I think that fellow citizens should have the advantages to car usage, because not everyone would feel comfortable ridding around in a bus or a train with lots of other people . But then again you have some conflicts with the environment getting all ugly and nasty . Some people are different from others not everyone will want to go the same way meaning . They rather have their own privacy and not be on a bus or a train full of random people that might be sick with a flu or smell really nasty. Thats why 80 percent of transportation has been thruogh highways an only 20 percent to other transportation . Most of the people who intend to use train or buses don't have the right amount of money to purchase a brand new car or even a used one . The cause of that is Taxes or IRS are taking to much from the people who work to hard an theres nothing that can be done too that.

This is what I don't get about how things are being done to try an save our planet called earth . If you want to try an save some thing an make it better. Don't make a expensive invention an expect people to by it like for examlpe the hybrids or plug-in cars. People can't afford many things in life because money comes an goes without out you evening knowing it . So why try to start something new when its only making more of a mess that inventers are cuasing.

The way Bogota is going is the best idea that I've ever heard of they couldn't of nailed it any better . They stopped a capital city of 7 millon people from using their cars . An look at the good effects it did, new restaurants where opened an upscale shopping district haved cropped up .  The pitted an uneven sidewalks have been fixed an replaced by new smooth sidwalks. Even parks and sports centers haved also bloomed throughout the city, which is good because parents have more time an money to get their kids more actived in to sports an going out to play.

The last passage explanes what I've been saying less people are buying cars why invent new things . People are going unemployedment an things aren't going to get any better for our country . The governments are asking for to much plus you have taxes an the IRS right behind them waiting to grab your money that you worked hard for . Another thing that I don't get is why the President of the untied states can help other countries but yet can't even of seem to help his own country who is lossing more money as days go by . Whats going on up their in the white house we the people slecet you the president to run our country not others an help benfit us.                                                                                                                                       ",1,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A56A8D2836AD,"global warming has been said to be a problem for years now. it has been said that we are slowly but surely destroying our o-zone layers. and air pollution is for sure one of the main causes. Smog levels have risen substancially and it shows, but there are more and more solutions that are begining to show.

germany definitely has the right approach here. they live in what is pretty much a car free society. in a one square mile city of 5500 people, 70% of them do not have cars. everything in that city is within walking or biking distance so there is no need for one. having a society like this is also very stress relieving in a sense. you no longer have the every day stress of being on a highway or constantly alert for cars, a society like this is for the most part more laid back then a regular one. the amount of exercise is also increased here because you are walking or biking everywhere, you are constantly moving. it is something that every country should take into consideration. the long term effects of pollution will be detremental to our world and we know that. now is our time to fix that.

tail pipe emission accounts for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50% in dense cities in the United States. and after near record breaking pollution in just a matter of days, paris decided to put a partial ban on driving. by doing this congestion in the city was down 60%, and by doing this the smog cleared relatively quickly. in this short amount of time that driving was partially banned we were able to see a large decrease in not only pollution but the amount of congestion in a city. not only does this make everyday life safer for every day citizens but improves the living quality of all people by making the air and world cleaner. projects like this are showing multiple benefits and great long term affects, not only for car drivers but for pedestrians that are walking the streets to, if congestion in a busy city is down by that much it makes getting around a lot easier for someone who walks/bikes/or runs eveerywhere. i think its crucial for people to understand the upsides to having societies like this. grnated it will be hard to adjust to but the upsides to it will outwiegh the cons in the long run.

a big thing to look at here in one of the benefits of having a car free society like this is not just the pollution but the exercise rate. as americans we are without a doubt an overweight country and thats obvious. what having something like this would do for us is incredible. even if it was a one day thing to try like Bogota, Colombia. once a year everyday they have what is called a ""car free day"" where everyone in the city is restricted from using cars unless it is a taxi or transit. this now enforces or allows if you will, everyone to ride a bike, skate, run, or walk to their destination. the streets are left practically empty. when you also do this you can bring improvements to your community. Bogota went from a cracked unevenly paved sidewalk to the replacement of smooth broad and even sidewalks. parks and sport centers have increased and blossomed all throughout the city, and you see the community just start to come together as a whole.

Now with all this being said there obviously are still downsides to cutting out gas producing cars. weather being a main one. suppose it rains one day, how do you get to work? not only that but in warmer climates if you have to go a longer distance to get to your job it gets hot and if you are in your suit and tie you're going to be sweating. if you are a blue collar worker, you have equipment that you have to keep on you at all times not having a vehicle will restrict that. not being able to drive will also slow down many buisnesses that travel to someones home such as a lawn service or a plumber. if you work out of town how do you get to your job? people would have to leave their families and move closer to their workplace if they worked out of town or quit their job. there is a lot to take into consideration when you think about all the possibilities of creating a society like this. and the only way this could work is if it was incorporated the same way that it was for Vauban germany. if you had a one square mile society where everything was walking distance and your job was in the area then i believe it would be extremely beneficial, but areas like that are few and far between and making areas like that would change the geography of the entire country.

by no means are we as a country (America) ready to change to this kind of society any time soon, but i do think that in due time we can benefit from this in a huge way. but there is a lot that has to change and our nation as a whole has to be willing to conform to this. there would be a substancial amount of change in this nation if this were to happen and we as a country are not one that necessarily likes change. we like our two car white pickett fence houses and cutting that out of everyones lives would no go over well with the majority of Americans. this is something that the future of America needs to seriously take into consideration. its appearant that we are destroying our world every single day and we are one of the main contributors. this is our chance to help ourselves and the generation to come, but are we willing to conform and put our luxiories aside for the greater good of mankind?

By limiting car usage, the amount of greenhouse gasses- gasses produced by exaust, carbon dioxide, etc.- would be reduced. Greenhouse gasses effect the ozone layer of the earths atmosphere and that in turn effects the health of everyone breathing in the earths oxygen. Greenhouse gasses, albiet the healthy sounding name, is not good for people or the enviornment. By limiting car usage, people can put a dent in the amount of greenhouse gasses being produced.

Changing the way one lives can change the way they look at life. Some people in the community of Vauban have found happiness just by reducing their car usage. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two"" (3) In this community people get to experience walking down the street, hearing people instead of the constant sound of a running car.

AD3FFB7CA387,"Cars are one of the most common things in most countries today. Not a day goes by where a person will not see a car drive by, it has become the main use of transportation and, for the most part, can be the easiest use of transportation. But, so many people have been getting cars lately, that some problems have been arising. For example, the gas that cars release can be harmful to the environment, cars overall have been making people much less active, and we can easily use electric cars instead of cars that run on gasoline.

To begin with, cars release chemicals from the gasoline that can pollute the air. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" (Duffer 10). This states that the air has been getting so polluted that some cities have been temporarily banning the use of cars because of this issue. Earth has been getting too polluted and destroyed lately, to the point that some people have been trying to predict an ""end is nigh"" date due to all of these issues with earth. Scientists have been talking about global warming for years now, and the problems we have been having with the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (Elisabeth Rosenthal 29). So it seems that the lower use of cars by Americans has been helping the atmosphere and postponing the date of the complete destruction of the ozone layer. That was why cars have such a big impact on the environment as a whole.

Next, cars have also been making people less active. One of the largest issues for parents in today's world is trying to get their children away from the computer, television, and cell phone. Technology has lessened the need for toys and books, since children entertain themselves with games on their tablets or books they download also on the tablet. But cars play a big part in this. When a person first gets a car, he/she feels free. You feel like the world is yours because you can go anywhere. But the problem is that people become less social with cars. Instead of going to play a sport with some friends, most people would rather drive somewhere else. It is also the reason the United States is ranked second in country with the most overweight people, vehicles are so unexpensive here that anyone is able to purchase a car and drive to their destination instead of riding a bicycle or skateboard and getting some real exercise. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks"" (Selsky 28). This also shows the improvement on the cities' sidewalks and the increase of people attending parks. Without cars, the streets look better and people recieve more exercise.

Finally, the use of cars is quite a problem but there is another solution: Electric cars. Electric cars are a new invention, and for the past decade they have been atempting at perfecting an electric car. The brand,

Tesla , has already released a few electric cars that seem to work quite well. The vehicles make no noise when driving, and they even have a new ""sportsy"" look to them, for th young adults that want a nice looking car. But the only problem is the battery. Electric cars are being banned in some states due to the lack of reliability with these batteries. They have not yet been perfected, and can cause accidents. But even with the risk one would be taking while driving one of these cars on the streets, it is still a fantastic replacement for normal cars, since it does not release anything that can harm the environment. So the best solution would be to wait a few years until the batteries get better and the prices drop, then purchase an electric car, but still know when to stop using it and ride the bicycle instead. Combining the use of a battery rather than gasoline, and not overusing the car, you will have the perfect combination, which is what everybody should strive to accomplish. Help the environment, and get the right amount of exercise.

In the end, cars are still one of the most common and one of the greatest things on Earth today. Getting a first car is a dream come true, but too much of it can be harmful. So get some use out of the bicycle, avoid poisoning the atmosphere, and cars will be a vehicle with no reprocautions at all, and it will be the perfect source for transportation, while keeping your morals where they should be.

6ADFF6668896,"It's not a secret that we as humans use cars to get places. The mall, the grocery store, school, work. All these places may be too far to walk to, or just too much of a hassle to not use a car to get to. This is why vehicles have long been a main export and very commonly seen sight in the world. But what are they costing us? To name a few, vehicles are costing us clean air, time, and money that we are not going to get back easily, unless we change our bad habits. That's why limiting car usage is so beneficial to us as a population, not only for ourselves but for future generations as well. Putting a cap on driving will help us with the large amount of emmissions that is put out every day, it will reduce jams and increase safety, and it will be less expensive. Cars are a dirty form of transportation that need to be controlled better.

Along the lines of dirty, cars give off a gross amount of emmissions into the atmosphere. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. . .and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" Cars, because they are used so much and so densely in the world, give off the highest amount of carbon emissions, second only to power plants. This is detrimental to our atomosphere and puts a serious weight on the air around us. Smog has started to get to escalate the extremes. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" as stated by Robert Duffer in an article detailing the heavy smog that rivaled even Beijing, China, often known as one of the most polluted cities globally. The five-day restriction on driving was implemented to, basically, give the air a rest after the intenseness of the trapped smog in the city reached 147 micrograms pf particulate matter per cubic meter, comparered with Brussels' 114 and London's 79.7. If we were to enforce this rule of reduced drivinhg everywhere, the amount of deducted pollution would be astronomical. It would be healthier for both the environment and for us humans.

Also being safer for humans would be the lower amount and intensity of traffic jams that would come with a restrictive hold on cars. With only exceptions for plug-in cars, hybrids, cars carrying three or more people, and public transportation, traffic jams would be nearly nonexistent. Examples have already been seen in places where restrictions have been implemented. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France,"" stated by Duffer of the ban on cars for the five-day pollutuion scare. Another big example is written my Andrew Selsky, and he states, ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or too buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of [Bogota, Colombia] eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Densely populated cities and highways are extremey dangerous, both for cars that may get into accidents and for the pedestrians that may be present. With a reduction of cars, the danger of being hit is lowered greatly. It also saves time, due to jams and high volumes of traffic bogging of streets gone. Walking and biking would be safer, and for the few who drive smartly, such as with a hybrid, the traffic would be all but gone as well. Health expenses and potential hospital bills would be avoided, and ease of getting where you need to go would be stress-free and simple.

On the important topic of less expenses, this leads into the final claim. Along with the restrictions of cars use comes less expenses, something we all want. Elisabeth Rosenthal writes, "". . .the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explaination certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and apprears to be persisting now that the recovery is underway."" This shows that the lessened use of cars has lead to an increase in money, and people are continuing to go through with this idea. Money is important to us, it is our lifeline in this cash-oriented world. Without it, we live poorly, in all senses of the word.

To end off, driving is not something absolutely needed in our world. It strips us of smog-free environments, time, safety, and money. Putting a cap on driving will help us with the large amount of emmissions that is put out every day, it will reduce jams and increase safety, and it will be less expensive in our daily lives. To reduce driving is to increse our standard of living.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
7EC6A6C5BF49,"Many people use cars to get around every day.  It's become a common form of transportation and a way of life.  But with this, there are also negative effects of having the widespread use of cars.  It pollutes the earth with substances like smog and uses up more resources from the earth that it needs to, taking from the resources later generations may need.  There are several benefits to reducing the use of cars, such as a cleaner and less polluted earth, and we as people will start to become smarter about our resources.

There are several countries where smog is a serious issue, making it warmer than it should be and dimming the area. not only this, it destroys the Earth's atmosphere.  There are cities where they hold days where nothing but public transportation is allowed, and people who violate will be fined.  Days like these decrease pollution and create a better environment for ours and other generations to come.  If cities all around the world took stands such as this and began to have multiple days of no cars or even ban them, the world may become a cleaner and less polluted place, and the atmosphere may not be destoyed as easily.  What it seems, is that all it really takes is just some effort from us to make the world a better place.

With the banning of car use comes the knowledge of how much of our resources we have wasted on them.  We may start to realize what we have done to the earth, and in turn, ourselves.  It is an extreme pollution to the earth, destroying the atmosphere and depleting the metals and materials used to make and drive these cars.  With the reduction of the use of cars comes the fact that we will no longer destroy the earth with gasoline and diesel fuel, but instead try to keeo if clean and preserve what we still have left.

So, if we try to reduce the usage of cars worldwide, we will stop the massive polution we have created and will gain the knowledge of what we have done, instead of living in blissful ignorance.  There is something we can learn with this. Without cars, smog would almost not be caused by us, and we as a race will no longer destroy our home.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Limiting car ussage will help reduces greenhouse gases and also reducing smog. Limiting car usage improve safety because  there won't be any cars on the roads.

To begin with limitng car ussage will lower smog levels. ""In Paris on cold and warm days hve caused a warm layer of air that trapped car emssions."" In France diesel is favored over gasoline. in france sixty-seven percent of the vehicles are diesel so diesel fuel was to blame. After five days of intensifying smog congestion was down sixty percent.

In addition to lowering smog levels. limiting car usage is a good way to lower stress. Buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""it was a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution.""as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

Then limiting car usage will help improve safety because there won be cars on roads so you cant get hit. a study last year found that young people driving decreased by twenty-three percent between 2001 and 2009. people have said they are interested in getting their drivers license but it's not a priority.

Air pollution is caused by fossil fuels. So people around the world are cutting car usage to prevent anything bad from happening. The advantages of limiting car usage are less air pollution, more exercies, and little burning of fossil fuels.

In the article ""In german suburb, life goes on without cars,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it says that in Vauban, Germany the residents have given up their cars. In Vauban they are forbidden to use cars. They made everything close together so tha the residents can be at walking distance. ""When I had a car I was always tense.

395A9CBBDB18,"As the world begins to grow and expand, many people have found that living without cars can be more beneficial. Cities and suburbs around the world, have found that reducing car usage has a grest number of advantages. This is reducing pollution, and is reducing stress. The world is shifting into a new way of life, not involving cars.

Cars release a large amout of greenhouse gases into the atmospere every single day, and this is harming the environment. Experts explain that, ""efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes"" (Rosenthal), have been taking place in suburban communities in Germany. This has resulted with a, ""12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Rosenthal). Also, Paris has seen near-record amounts of pollution and smog in the city, so the global city has limited motorists' driving on two days of the week, Monday and Tuesday. The climate in Paris, ""[causes] the warm layer of air to trap car emissions"" (Duffer), thoughout the atmospere in the city, but the limitation on motorists at the beginning of the week has allowed the smog to clear up.

Helping the environment is not the only benefit of reducing car usage, yet it can also relieve stress in your eveeryday life. There is no need to stress out over traffic, finding somewhere to park, or even paying the expences that come with owning a car. In Germany, most residents don't own cars, and Heidrun Walter explained that she is, ""much happier this way"" (Rosenthal), because she doesnt have to worry about traffic. She has enjoyed a healthier life style that is stress free, by walking or biking to the places she needs to be. In Colombia, there is a day that citizens will not use cars, once a year. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees that, ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress"" (Selsky). There is no need to worry about rush hour, or other traffic.

Others don't see the advantages of reducing car usage. Delivery companies complain about the loss in revenue, yet they aren't thinking about the benefits. They can save their employees from stressing out, or even help the environment. Reducing car usage would be a huge cultural shift, that has many advantages.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

"". Life just goes on without cars.

There is no doubt paris that has the most cars are actually not allowing people to drive their cars. like it said in the report Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear off the global city, therefore if they use their car during they are banned they have pay the fine of 22-euro (

$31

).It is better to lieve ur cars at home than get a fine,i tell you that. Since the air is poluted, therefore using cars brings more polution. Just banning cars forever should bet for the best.

Now adays people are using other transportation to get around without using cars. In the country bogota they banned the cars to only have buses and taxis for the people to get around. Bogota have a goal to promote alternative transportation. They want the people to participate in giving money to their country. The mayor of Bogota Antansas Mockus excitedly says ""the rain hasn't stopped people from participating"". It is great that people don't have to depend on cars anymore. they have another way to get around, especially the healthy way like riding a bike, or skating.

Who wants to ride a car anymore. Its just too expensice. lieves people broke, without even a penny in their pocket. People have other things to pay like their bills. Cars are just a distraction. Gas prices are just shooting up like a rocket,in the other hand still have to pay the car's insurance, and all that. People can afford a car anymore.

In conclusion, not people are living their lives without cars. Cars are banned due to the polution in the air.

In paris, driving has been suspended due to growing amounts of fog. after days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Cold nights and war days caused the warmwer layer of air to trap car emissions. If the driving roads are not safe, then they should create a driving ban on people for safety.

My first reason is the way driving affects the atmosphere.  In Paris the government enforced rules stating that ""motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine.""  This is because the cars were emitting smog which is a gas that lingers in the air polluting it.  The smog was getting worse than Bejing, China ""one of the most polluted cities in the world.""

The second reason we need to cut back on driving motor vehicles is it is limiting our phisical activity.  In Bogota, Colombia they started a movement ""a day without cars.""  the were fining everybody with the exceptions of buses and taxis.  On this day a lot of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work on this day.  ""Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic.""  Some effects of this movement were straight paved sidewalks and sports centers for people to enjoy.

84425797BC28,"Limiting car usage would have many advantages to the community around it. But the main two advantages to limithing cars is the reduction of polution,and also the reduction of congestion in many suburbs. Many cities including Bogota,Paris,and cities surrounding those have already started to limit the usage of cars.

One big problem many scientist are beginning to find out about our world is that our ozone layer is being desroyed by polution we put in the air. A big contributer to polution is the exhaust being produced by the million of cars used everyday. Another big problem countrys all over the world have to worry about is smog,or a thick layer of fog that is really hard to see through. having this very dangerous factor in the road many car crash ratings have sky rocketed. One way this can be stop is to do what these few country have been doing, that is to have days through out the year where people cant use their cars at all. To help in force this day police have been giving people fines roughly around thirty dollars. In Bogota,Colombia it was the third straight year cars have been banned. after all these years of banning cars the turnout was large. despite gray clouds that poured rain all over Bogota. When the smog went away from Bogota many other cities from Colombia have joined the event of banning cars. a qoute from

Car-Free Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota says that "" Parks and sprots centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven,pitted sidewalks ahve been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts ahve cropped up"". To have these results to such a simple idea is incredible.

Another big problem in pretty much all countrys is congestion of their inner streets. When streets have major traffic alot of things change including the mood of people,and there is a higher percentage of car crashes. To fix this problem many cities did pretty much the same as before to retrict cars on certain days. A brilliant idea was presented and used in Paris. The idea was that ""on Mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave= their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31), The same would apply to odd-numbered plates that following day"". After this brilliant event finished congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, and after five days the smog was gone.

2C633C845066,"The modern automobile has been the axle to the wheel of the smog ridden contemporary age. Within a century, a car could be found within virtually every home across every developed nation. Though in recent years, the societal infatuation with private automobiles has begun to diminish. Mulitple European and South American countries began instituting beneficial ""car-free"" municipal policies and statistics show a decline in licencse registration and car purchases across the U.S. The progression of the ""car-free"" policies and trend will have beneficial ecological, economical, and social implications on the modern world.

The concern of greenhouse gas emissions from cars has been of much concern within the scientific world. With cities such as densely populated Bejing often covered in sheets of poisonous smog, the high emissions has proven deadly to both human and enviromental life. According to source 2, Paris recently was plagued by statuated amounts of smog rivaling that of Bejing. The French solution to this problem was municipal action and a week long ban on certain vehicles. The smog contained nearly 147 micrograms of particulate matter and the country's high use of disel as a gasoline alternative was a contributing factor. The policy was immediately effective as the smog lifted after only one day of the ban. Though the smog that plagued Paris is not only a problem of the French. As stated by Source 1, passenger cars alone are responsible for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions within car-intensive areas of the U.S. such as Chicago and Detriot.

The focus on automobiles with the development of car-intensive cities, such as the aforementioned Chicago and Detriot, has carried an economical burden in tandem with it's ecological consequences. According to Source 1, 80 percent of monetary appropriations have gone to highways with 20 percent going to other forms of public transit. As exmplified within the same article, Vauban, Germany has pioneered the car-free suburban model. Maximizing ergonomics to improve public foot transit, it has financially benefited from the prohibition of cars and the nuturing of its enviorment.

We live in aworld where cars are now becoming a major trend, and we're driving them more and more. If we keep drawing that pattern, we won't have a stable world to live in.

I'm not saying to completely stop using your vehicles, although we might see a larger change than expected, what I'm saying is to manage your car usage wisely. Every time we pick up the keys, start our engine and take off to the nearest grocery store, we add a larger threat to the environment. In 'Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog' by Robert Duffer, it informs of the enforcement France is taking to clean up it's polluted cities. Duffer shows us how ""the smog"" that invades the city became a rival to Beijing, China, which is known as the most polluted cities in the world. Imagine going outside to see the beautiful sun, and instead open the door to cars delivering blinding ""smog."" We can't allow ourselves to become the most polluted cities, and the first step is to manage ourselves with our cars.

There's some of us who suffer from stress and anxiety. There's some of us who look at our community and are probably never wanting to go outside again. That is not a community to live in. We deserve to feel relieved, relaxed, and renewed from time to time. In 'Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota' by Andrew Selsky, it demonstrates a perfect example. Selsky writes about a ""Car-Free"" day in Bogota, Columbia, and a man shares his side of this event. Carlos Arturo Plaza tells us, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polluton."" Selsky writes in paragraph 28 the benefits of this event. He writes, ""Parks and sport centers bloomed... Dramatically cut traffic... New restaurants and shopping districts developed."" Look what we can accomplish from not using our cars as much.

We're in a time where money is the top priority in our lives. All those gas prices, and the car insurance car owners must pay is ridiculous. Sometimes people can't even sleep at night due to all the thinking of ""how will I pay this?"", or ""how will I pay that?"" It later becomes a constant battle. This is when technology comes in handy. Now with the common ""Facebook"" and other social media, we're able to connect more and more. It's sad to see people waste their money going to a friends house for probably an hour or so, when they can just talk virtually. Elisabeth Rosenthal, writer of 'The End of Car Culture,' most likely will agree with me. Rosenthal inputs Mimi Sheller's say in all this. Sheller is a sociology professor at Drexel University, and she cites important factors on paragraph 35. ""Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Why drive and pay for gas when you can get on the web? You'll be glad you did.

Now, many will be able to disagree with me saying that, ""we need cars to drive long distances,"" or, ""I rather pay and have my own privacy then be with twenty people I don't know on a bus."" That's fine. I'm not saying to wipe out the fact that you have a car, all I'm saying is to use it wisely. Drive long distances, not short ones that can take you ten minutes to walk. ""What about the people who work in car companies?"" Well, if we all followed what Bogota is doing and develop shopping districts and renewal companies, I'm sure there will be many jobs available. No matter the pay, you'll still have no worry about your automobile bills, which will help you save a huge amount of money. We need to save ourselves from driving and polluting the earth, or else we won't have a great life to live. Blinding smog will cover the sky, and many won't be able to enjoy the rich outside there once was. All we will see are streets instead of parks. We need to stop ourselves from driving too much in order to live to the fullest.    ",6,Car-free cities,Text dependent

C4379D733479,"Limiting car usage has many advantages. The most important advantage is reducing pollution. Vehicles emit greenhouse gasses from their tailpipe. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse has emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"", as said in source one,

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

One of the main reasons the pullution is so bad in Europe is because of the diesel fuels. According to Reuters, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average in the rest of Western Europe. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114, and London had 79.7. The numbers show that there is a direct correlation between the percent of diesel used, and the amount of pollution in an area.

Limiting car usage also helps cities grow. In Bogota, 118 miles of bicycle paths were constructed. Along with parks and sports centers blooming up, side walks have been replaced. Even new restraunts and shopping districts have been built. And on top of all this, traffic has been majorly reduced. As said in the exerpt,

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , ""These people are generating a revolutionary change.""

Not only does reducing the amount of cars help the enviornment, it's better for your health. Pollution doesn't only affect the environment, it also damages the body. As the air gets polluted by greenhouse gas emissions, you breath in that air. And that contaminated air is the same contaminated air that is being cycled throughout our body. On top of that, reducing the usage of vehicles would force you to find a new way to get to your destination. You might resort to walking, jogging, bike riding, skating, or anything else you could think of. Limiting car usage would force you to excercise, which is obviously very beneficial to one's health.

Another advantage of limiting vehicle usage is the money that would be saved. Limiting vehicle usage would result in not buying gas as often. And as expensive as gas can get, that would would be a lot of money saved. If you went as far as selling your vehicle, there's even more money that you would benefit from.

So there are many advantages that result from limiting vehicle usage. For one, it reduces pollution, which is bad for the enviornment, as well as our health. Secondly, it would force us to excercise more. And lastly it would save us a lot of money.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
