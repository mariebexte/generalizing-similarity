D93992A086FE,"Cars have been around for awhile and they have had a major impact on society. Many people believe that there is no problem with the frequency of cars being driven. But, there are many advantages to less car use such as improving our cities and suburbs, improving safety, and decreasing pollution.

Many have tried to make cities a little more dense and better for walking but nothing has seemed to work; therefore, they have moved on to suburbs. Now, people are trying to make suburbs better for getting around while walking instead of driving. By doing so, places such as shops will be made closer and more convienent which allows people to be able to consider walking as a better option. By having these suburbs, and soon hopefully cities, reduce the amount of cars used, the people living in these areas will be able to accomplish more in a healthier and safer way.

Safety has been an issue in almost all areas due to a variety of reasons; one being cars. People pass by ""Drive Safely"" signs or memorials on the side of the road too often. Many accidents occur because of all the cars and traffic and careless driving. By reducing the amount of cars being driven, the moment of deaths in car accidents can be reduced as well. In ""The End of Car Culture"", author Elisabeth Rosenthal states, ""Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends."" Recently, teenagers who are able to get their license haven't really made it a priority. This could be caused by factors such as fear of driving or just because they've figured out a way around driving. Not everyone needs a car to get around; there are plenty of other ways to safely get from point A to point B.

Another large issue cars contribute to is pollution. Pollution is in every city, every state, every country, every continent. Cars are ""a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes..."" (Rosenthal, Elisabeth, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars""). Cars don't help with environmental issues what-so-ever. They add to the smog issues and they increase the about of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In the capital of France, for example, congestion was down sixty percent due to smog causing delivery companies to lose money since they couldn't delieve what was needed. Cars are extremely harmful to the environment and they make the issues we already have even larger. By limiting car usage, people could hopefully work on repairing the damage we have already done to the environment instead of worsening it.

Cars have impacted society ever since they were made. By reducing the amount of cars driven, cities and suburbs can be improved, better safety can be implimented, and pollution will reduce. Until then, the issues cars create will continue to get worse and by the time people see it, the problems will be too late to fix.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A0A1B3E16EE5,"World war II was the start of development centering cars but; in the recent years the popularity as well as the traffice has gone down because of limiting car usage which have lots of advantages. Limiting the use of cars advantages are less air pollution and new communities

Initially, less car usage means less carbon emissions which leads to less air pollution. For example, Elisabeth Rosenthal author of "" The End of Car Culture"" wrote ""If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emmisions and the enviorment since transportation is the second largets source of America's emmisions..."". Limiting the use of cars will have a really big benefit on the enviorment by stopping more emmisions from damaging the O-zone layer. For example in Bogota, Colombia they have a day called ""Day Without Cars"" and Carlos Arturo Plaza a businessman who lives ther says ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" from ""Car-free day is spinning into big hit in Bogota"" written by Andrew Selsky. People living there have seen the benefits of the limits on cars and thinks it's a really good thing for their cityand not even rain can stop people from participating says Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus.

Additionally, these limititations have created new communities by building places that are very easy to get to. For example, Elisabeth Rosenthal author of ""In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" wrote ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away on a main street, Rather than in malls along some distant highway."" With the new approach of limithing car usage things are built closer making many things accessible to everyone. For example, Andrew Selsky the author of ""Car-free day is spinning into big hit in Bogota"" wrote ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions dramatically cut traffic; and new restraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."". With the changes of accessibility buissness owners have to come where the money is making everything more accessible and creating new things in the area. Building things closer attracts more people which means more homes being built and more families enoying the community.

Clearly, the advantages of limiting car usage is amazing because it means less air pollution and new communities. Limitations on car usage will benefit us and the world.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
7FCBE68F5923,"Is there a possibillty that we can live a better life without the use of cars? Yes there is many counties have stoped the use of cars because it's cheaper. For example in VAUBAN,Germany they have given up theif cars street parking,driveways,and home garages are generally forbidden. Vauban's streets are car free except the main thorougfare of course. 70% of Vaubans's familis do not own cars, and 57% sold there cars to move there. Many people say that when they had a car there were more tense they say there much happier this way without a car.

Cars come with a responasabillaty thers so much dangrous things that can happen to you while in a car. For example all the accedentd people get in each day hundres ot thousands of people die each year for car crashes. Also people who cause the accedents like drunk driving, or texting while driving ect.. Any little thing can happen in a car that can take your life forever just with a blink of an eye. In other cases like getting pulled over and the incerance you have to pay and all the money we spent daily on gas.

While in BOGOTA,Colombia they have a no car day! It all started in  the 1990's where there was traffic jams it was 3 straight years cars been  banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this city of 7 million people. But a man named Carlos Arturo he rode a two seated bicycle with is wife other two colombians saw hin and decided to do the same. tjis becaqme big everyone stared doing this and they even smoothen out the side walks for the bikes. The streats where busy with bike traffic.

I think we  should start walking places like for example if you need to go to the store and you have one right neer your home dont get in your car walk. By doing this it will help us save gas money and get excerce. Many american are over weight because they dont get any excerce. So by not using our cars once and a while it will help us and our invierment it will stop so much palustion caused  by cars. we should take some time off our car and enjoy nature.                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
FDAD27942E2C,"Many cities around the world have already learned the benifits to limiting or getting rid of car usage. A few of these cities are Vauban, Paris, Bogota. These cities experience less smog and pollution.

People in the places that have limited car uses do not seem to mind. A quote from

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal explans how giving up their car has improved their live, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"". Cars do cause alot of tension and stress from being in trafic and having to deal it bad drivers on the road. Many people are already too stressed and anything that can limit stress is good for you.

In Bogota, Colombia the city has ond day that is car-free. This day people hike, skate, or used public transportation to get where they needed to be. Violaters are fined $25. The over all goal of this day is to promote diffrent forms of transportation. Even though weather can be a factor it didnt seem to affect people.

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky states how this is true ""The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota."" This quote also shows that people are fine surviving with out cars.

Paris baned driving for diffrent cars on diffrent days because of the near-record pollution. Moday cars with even-numbered license would be fined 22-euros if they drove and the next day the rule would apply to odd-numbered licences. There were exceptions for cars that are plug-in, car pools with three or more people, and hybids. Robert duffer, the author of

Paris bans driving due to smog showes how well the ban worked in this quote 'The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to riscind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"". This is a great example of how much polution would be cut out if we stopped or limmited useing cars. Just one day with out everyone using cars and there was a diffrence in the smog amount.

Limiting car usage also will cut carbon emitions and help the enviroment. In

The End of Car Culture the author, Elisabeth Rosenthal states ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."" With a limit on cars, trucks, and other moter veicals greenhouse gas emissions will lower. America is already lowering it's car usage by it's self. People are buying fewer cars, getting fewer licenses, and driving less all together.

Over all the affect with giving up moter veicals and finding other forms of transpertation are very positive. People would have less stress, reduce in greenhouse gasses, and lower pollution.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
61346BD417B0,"Cars have long been viewed as a common method of transportation from point A to point B. However, in the world that we live in cars have become a burden and limited use would be best. Efforts to reduce car usage have shown to reduce the rate of carbon dioxide produced and smog. The elimination of car use would lead way to further development for other methods of transportation. Countries have taken the first step in banning car usage and its citizens have admitted to living nice and happier lives than they had before.

Common issues faced by car use is the production of carbon dioxide and the risk of smog. Smog is a health hazard to those with asthma, young children, and the elderly. By limiting the use of a car, carbon dioxide and smog rates would plummet dramatically. When Paris was faced with smog at near-record levels driving was banned and after a day of the driving ban smog levels were dropping already. Cars, a major contributor to carbon dioxide production, can decrease the rate of the greenhouse effect by limiting their use. Nearly 50 percent of the United State's greenhouse emissions come from the use of cars alone. By not driving your car the rate of greenhouse emissions would drastically decrease.

Besides the nice look to a car, cars are often used because there appears to be no other way to travel long distances. Other methods of transportation such as riding a bicycle, public transportation, and even walking are viable and beneficial methods of transportation. On bike you travel further than you would walking at a faster rate, Bogota has begun the develpment of 118 miles of bicycle paths in hopes of reducing traffic and carbon dioxide emmisions. A near 80 percent of appropraitions are used on highways, the rest of the 20 percent are used on other methods of transportation. By finding other methods of transportation (ie. walking, biking, public transportation) the 80 percent used on highways could be used to greatly improve other methods of transportation, like public transport.

The thought of parting from our cars is a terrifying idea, however countries around the world have taken the initiative and made these ideas law, laws that are benefiting their copuntries. In Germany an ecperimental community, Vauban, has little to no car activity. 70 percent of its families do not own a car and 57 percent sold their car to move to the community. Startingly, not only is this small community a success but many residents claim to be happier than they were when they owned a car. Columbia, like Germany banned the use of cars for one day in Bogota. Not only is everyone enthusiatic of the event but this day has led to the reduction of smog in Bogota.

The question to drive a car is a simple one. Why drive a car when you can walk, ride a bicycle, or can take the bus? By limiting our car use we'll reduce the rate of carbon dioxide emissions and smog. Other countries have tested and proven that life without a car is not only realistic but very beneficial to how one feels. With the options of other forms of transportation we should limit our use of the car. In doing so we'd be improving our lives and the rate of the greenhouse effect.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E0C57C8B7FFA,"Smog, backed up traffic ways, and stress seem to be the main factor contributing to the decrease in car usage. Although these seem to be very negative factors, there are many advantages to limiting car use including helping our Planet Earth and less costly factors.

To begin, when we look at studies we find that when people use their cars immensely, there is a harmful effect in our atmosphere, also reffered to as The Greenhouse Effect. France has been a major component to this harmful gas, as explained by Robert Duffer in the passage

Paris bans driving due to smog

""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals..."" In addition, Duffer continues to provide evidence to this claim by further emphasizing and comparing ""[Last] week Paris had 147 miocrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,"" By including this simple sentence, we are fully aware of just how much harm pollution has done to the environment due to car uage in Paris. Moreover, the smog in Paris was so intense that ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Although almost 4,000 drivers were fined, the smog had cleared enough by Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. This movement is also spreading to places such as Bogota, Colombia where they have a day free of cars with the exception of taxis and buses; for example, in the article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza explains ""It's a good opputunity to take away stress and lower air polution,"" Many ideas are being formed to show that people care about what their harmful ways have done and are looking to find solutions to minimize the pollution and undo what wrong has been done.

Buying cars over the years has become quite an expense to everyone and has become somewhat burden-like. By limiting and even canceling out the use of cars people have cut down expenses greatly. Public transportation is getting on board with this idea and trying to accomodate those who have made this decision by making public transit ""free of charge from Friday to Monday,"" according to the BBC in the article

Paris bans driving due to smog . As also mentioned the importance of car is no longer such an immediate thought to people more recently.  Elisabeth Rosenthal solidifies this in the article

The End of Car Culture when she includes ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This clear and simple states that people are not considering their cars as such an extreme item and more considering it as a means of transportation only when absolutely necessary such as when ""Bay Area Rapid Transit doesn't work."" As well costs not only personally so much as federally are being affected dramatically. Elisabeth Rosenthal author of In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars explains ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" By intorducing this idea, people are aware that the advantage is personal and is in the everyday common person's favor.

Not only are the advantages of limiting car usage subtle however they are also direct and can have immediate positive effects on people. By making sure people do not overdo the amount they utilize their cars, they become less stressed, have a healthier environment, and save money. This issue is worldwide however, the solution is becoming worldwide as well creating exceptional results and care from car drivers and people are really thinking outside of the box to make magic happen.

22AC599CAE0C,"I was very excited about my first trip to the West Coast (California) that I took last summer. It was a place Ive always fantazized over because of its variety of beauty from the surfing beaches to the skiing mountains to the north. When I first landed in LA, I expected some hustle and bustle of the city like Miami, but it was overwhelming to see the smog and traffic that polluted many peoples views of California, along with the air. Unfortunately, this is the case in many car intensive cities across the globe where limiting car usage would go a great deal farther than people actually know. The advantages of limiting car usage would allow for cleaner cities with less air pollution, and provide safety for pedestrians and even other car-users.

According to source 1 on car-free cities, Elizabeth Rosenthal states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas of the United States"" (Rosenthal, paragraph 5). This stat only presents part of the problem as the commercial and delivery industry add to that figure as well. Limiting car usage across the world is becoming more and more porular, as people finally come to realize the devastating effects of the greenhouse gas emissions on the atmosphere. Projects in places like France, Colombia, the United States, and other countries across the globe are making a huge effort at reducing car usage, and according to source 4 by Rosenthal, they seem to be working. "" Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by""(paragraph 29). Obviously, car usage altogether will not end, but limiting it can do a great deal in protecting the only planet sustainable for human life.

Furthermore, limiting the use of cars in areas of large pedestarian population, such as New York City, would ultimately lead to less tragic car accidents. Approximately 500 car accidents occur daily in the United States and probably upwards of 5000 across the globe. Car accidents are the leading cause of death in many societies which is unfortunate because almost all are preventable. Its when the driver is given too much power behind the wheel that their guard is let down. The rise of cellphones and texting have not helped the situation at all either. The good news is that the programs used worldwide solely for the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, are also reducing car accidents. "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" (Duffer, paragraph 14). Also in source 3 describing Bogota's Car free day is spreading to other countries of Latin-America with the intention of reducing traffic and allowing safer passage for pedestrians.

Ultimately, the importance of limiting car-usage across the world is being seen as crucial and is starting to take off. Limiting car usage reduces air pollution which is a serious threat to humanity these days, and also diminishes car related accidents. At the end of my trip to California, I was able to see the real beauty of the nature outside the city, when I got off the highway.                    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
5CC4975A833D,"Nowadays, pedestrians mostly travel by automobiles. It could be a car, a bus, or even a plane. But there is always a way to get from one place to another. What if this way of traveling wasn't right for this planet? After all, vehicles can cause global warming. Which isn't a good thing, It can make alot of things go wrong. But if we know this, why do we still carry on with our daily lives to drive vehicles that is a danger to our world.

Vauban, A city in Germany, Is a place for people who dont appreciate this cause. Vauban is a ""car-free"" city which houses five thousand fivehundred and fifity-five residents. The city itself was finish being built in 2006. Basically, its a city to separate suburban life from auto use. This movement is called ""smart planning"". The stores are closer to the towns where people live in, but more like being walking distance.

Paris once had suffered for a few days because of the cause of pollution. The troops stationed there had enforced a partial law to ban driving, to clear the air of the global city. On a Monday, each motorists with even-numbered license plates were given two options. To leave their cars at home or suffer a twenty-two euro fine. This rule was also appointed to the odd-numbered plates the following day. Arond four thousand drivers were fined, and their vehicles were impounded. They say that Diesel fuel was to blame. The colder nights and warmer days had caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. France has a policy that favors diesel over gasoline.

In Bogota, Columbia, There is a program that has been set up to spread out to other countries. The program is where citizens of their own country ( Or where they currently live), decide to find other means of travel instead driving their own vehicle to work. They could hike, ride a bike, or skate to work during this ""Day Without Cars"". This is the third year in a row that they have perfomed this task, with the acception for taking buses or taxi's if needed be. The goal of this program is to promote an alternative transportation and to reduce smog. People who violate this program are fined with twenty-five dollars.

Hence, Not everyone says or thinks that taking a walk instead of driving is a bad idea. A few countries accept it and so do small towns in bigger continents, who would rather drive than ride. Overall, this is helping us out in many ways. Global warming has been getting worse in the past few days. But if everyone could quit driving their vehicles every now and then. It would lower the pollution in the air that we have caused.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
ED96E3AB5161,"The effects of greenhouse gas emission began to take their toll on the earth's atmosphere simply by its own natural output. As time has gone on though, and humans and their ways of transportation have evolved, greenhouse gas emission is becoming more of a problem. Automobiles, mainly cars, play a huge role in the production of nasty fumes and gases that become trapped in the atmosphere. For example, in Europe passenger cars make up twelve percent of total greenhouse gas emission, and in heavily congested areas such as the United States-it can skyrocket up to fifty percent!

Some nations/countries are beginning to take a new approach to battle the ""War of Greenhouse Gases"". As studies have shown that national driving levels and the amount of people purchasing cars and earning their licenses are dropping after their peak in 2005, people are more and more willing to put down the car keys and put on their running shoes. One of these places in particular is the city of Vauban and is located in Germany. It is a middle-class to upper class community and its citizens can be considered pioneers of suburbia. Vauban does not permit driving in it's limits, besides the main thoroughfare, and a few side streets. Car owners buy a space for their car for $40,000 alongside a home.

While some might argue about the practicality of not driving your car if you have one, it's shown to be extremely beneficial not only for the environment, but for people as well. When you go outside, whether you're headed somewhere or just on a casual stroll, you may reach Nirvana as you enjoy the true sounds of nature. In places where cars are permitted to drive, you might hear the sound of birds chirping outside your window, or the calm rustle of leaves rustling in the wind, but the rumbles, roars, and honks of a car are not far behind. In areas such as Vauban, the beautiful sounds of the world won't be drowned out by a greasy hunk of steel.

Besides feeling at peace, a life without a car is a healthier life! Now, when you want to go somewhere, you must rely on your own two feet. Those two feet, bicycle, skateboard, etc. will be all you need to get where you're going! Unlike many places though, everything is within walking distance for convenience and to encourage you to take these steps. Notice the physical and emotional changes in yourself once in a place with no cars-you'll feel more relaxed, less rushed, and your body will thank you.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Like how residents from Germany upscale community are suburban pioneers and they have given up their car's. Street parkng, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in there district. Why is this forbidden? i just don't get it. Car owners buy there own space, for $40,000 along with there home. In Europe passenger cars are reponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new federal. So fellow citizens should help them out with there limiting car usage. they sure have a lot going on. Like in the end of car culture.

What about if it was raining how are we suppsoed to get to work or get food. we need a car to get to places. They say the rain hasn't stopped people from participating.

B8748AECBD72,"Limiting car usage has many advantages, from saving money, from helping save the planet. We spend tons and tons of dollars on a simple fossil fuel just so we can get around. Although, having a car may be nice, but also you may need to think about the long term consequences that are yet to come. For example, driving around while fun, is dangerous, you are facing the threats of drunk drivers, people not paying attention or something in general going wonky with your car, or how incredibly expensive cars are, you must buy the gas fill it up almost every two days, you will have to pay for any damages and also for the tune ups. Cars arent just expensive but they also do loads of damage to the environment. Cars, create fumes that are let out into the atmosphere that contributes to global warming. Sure, it may be nice to fdrive a big bubba truck with huge tires, some smoke stacks and to be able to ""roll coal"" but also think about what that does to the earth, it helps melt glaciers causing polar bears to be hot and hungry.

Driving a car may be convenient, but when something is convenient something else has to suffer. This something else would be the environent, there is less and less clean air for us to breathe, everything is getting hotter and everyone is suffering. Smog is one of the most relavent and visible issues, especially in bigger cities. Smog is a mixture of smoke, and fog, this smoke coming from vehicles and mostly factories. Going into a major city like New York City may be fun but while your there look around and notice the thick layer of smog. You are breathing all of that through out your body. While New York City may not be the smoggiest city around such as Beijing (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, Line 14) but it is still an on going issue everywhere.

All in all, leaving your car at home and taking a bike to work instead can have many health benefits but also many environmental benifits, so next time you think about bringing your car to work, think of the polar bears and the future of the environment.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
18DCD0C5C34F,"All around the world, people are using gas-gusling vehicles of mass destruction. Recently, Germany came up with the revolutionary idea to limit the use cars by forbidding street parking, driveways, and home garages in the new, experimental district of Vauban. Others have joined the bandwagon as well, instituting new laws, such as the ""Car-Free Day"" in Bogota, Colombia, and the partial-driving ban in Paris, France. France, Germany, and Colombia are the predeccessing countries to the innovational car usage limitations. These limitations have many advantages, such as a decrease in pollution, traffic, and a long-term positive culture shift.

Pollution and the emission of green-house gases is one of the common issues troubling countries world-wide. A limit of the use of cars and other various vehicles that run of fossil fuels has been proven to help counter the depleation of Earth's Ozone layer. According to

Source 2: Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,

""[The Smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world... Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" The city of Paris had legislated, ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home... The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day"" (

Source 2

). Resulting from their legislation, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"" (

Source 2

). Paris, originally one of the worlds' most-polluted cities, decreased their pollution so much in one day that it was deemed unnecessary to continue the ban for the odd-numbered license plates the next day. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (

Article 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

). A decrease in these emissions could have significant effects, as witnessed in Paris. Also, a Local Colombian businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza claimed that the Car-Free Day was ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (

Source 3: Car-Free Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota

). The government and their factions are in agreement that the ban on cars is only positive. Whether it is Colombia, Germany, or Paris, the restriction on drving was a major success. Imagine if more countries around the world opted to institute this ban; there would be no energy-crisis nor would there be as much of a pollution issue.

Along with the decrease in pollution, there would be a massive decrease in traffic. The vehicular limitations in the beta-countries (France, Colombia, and Germany) have shown that the restrictions imposed decrease the amount of traffic significantly. Based on

Source 3 , in Bogota, ""... a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Rather than having a holier-than-thou complex, these Colombians supported the greater good of their country and ceased use of all cars on the car-free day. A positive domino affect occured in Colombia as well. According to

Source 3 , ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" These beta countries have improved the standard of living by meerely putting some restrictions on driving for brief periods of time. The United States has seen various changes as well. While there are no current driving restrictions, new priorities are being discovered, such as the bike-sharing program in one of America's most heavily trafficed cities, New York. According to

Source 4: The End of Car Culture , ""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a poliferation of car-sharinf programs across the nation."" Nations are beginning to catch on to the contagious cold of revolutionary alternatives to driving and traffic crises.

France, Germany, Colombia, and the United States are already seeing positive changes. The long-term culture shift is proving to be an aspiration for many countries. According to

Source 4 , ""The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of city centers has made the suburbs less appealing and has crawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" People are becoming more connected through digital devices as societies become more technologically advanced, therefore the need for a large amount of privately owned cars has become moot. In Vauban, Germany, Heidran Walter, a media trainer and mother, claims, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (

Source 1

). Commoners, such as Mrs. Walter, are respoding positively to the laws of the experimental district of Vauban, which has very few areas and opportunities for cars. In fact, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"" (

Source 1

). This modern-day industrial revolution is drawing vast numbers of people into the areas inwhich cars have become a rarity.

), it should not be considered a failed experiment. Of the millions of people who live in France, they only saw a small fraction of driving infractions on the day they limited driving. The long-term culture shift that the world is beginning to see is certainly moving in a positive direction.

Between ISIS and the iPhone, the world has come across a variety of both positive and negative circumstances. Considering all of the positive effects of limitations of cars, including but not limited to less traffic, a decrease in pollution, and long-term culture shifts, there have been many advantages to the switch to a car-free enviornment. Even though transportation may take longer, it will be safer and better for the enviornment. Not everyone country can guarantee that all of their citizens will abide by the new laws, as shown in France, but a small fraction of the trouble is better than the mass population of millions, and in some places billions, wrecking havoc on the planet.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
6ED603E059F7,"limiting car usage would be great for all of us around the world. It would be good for us to function regurlaly without a car. It would show us how people a long time ago got to different places by waliking or public transportation. I think by all of us not using cars will make us see how grateful we are for having cars. By us not having a cars it would help with our air pollution,help us get daily excercise,and help us spend less money on technology.

Although cars are a great benefit to our lives it can harm us as well. For example in Paris they had a near record breaking smog problem due to all the cars. The people of paris thought that diesel was the problem. Paris has more air pollution than any other European capitals. In recent recorded data paris had ""147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in brussels and 79.9 in london"" (paragraph 17 line 2-4). This shows that cars have a big advantage in our society today and a big part of our health as well.

Not having a car is good for us because it gives us daily excercise. By walking or riding a bike to work or school is good for our bodies. It allows us to take a breath of fresh air and enjoy nature and clear our minds. By walking to work it allows to take away stress and focus on what you are going to do that day. Not having a vehicle is good for us and makes us take advantage of life.

Lastly not having a car saves money. Being carless saves us money on gas and oil changes. If your car breaks down;thats extra money you have to spend on for car parts. If you got into a car accident you would have to pay for not only your car ,but the other persons car as well. You could save tons of money for yourself and your family by not having a vehicle. Not having a car quickly improves your health and your pockets.

This lifestyle will be healthy for all of us and shows us all we maybe missing out on. We as people rely to much on technology and put our everything into these devices. By us doing this it will improve our way of living.                                 ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Whether it a family going on vacation, going to  work or going to school.  With all of these possible benfits and more is what we gain from cars. We don't realize how cars really have an effect in our everyday changing world. That the moment we put the car key in to turn on the car we are creating are more hazordous world for the present time and  the furture to come. By,limiting car usage in the world we can do many postive and beneficial things like in our atmosphere,  becoming a independent person without the need of a car, and to be relive as oneself.

To begin with, pollution can be reduced like never ever before in are world named history. Pollution now in days is just terrible to have. It not just make it difficult  for us to breathe but, as well it destroy the atmoshere that we need protect us from the harmful rays of the sun. The greenhouse effect can be lowered if we limit the use of cars. This can be actually proven with the following exert of the passage,"" And that experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Source #1) The point that I'm really trying to convey, is that we can do this all together if we limit the car usage. There should be a well and profounded effort to do so. Another example would be that if we dont limit the usage of cars we can not have a fresh and clear atmoshere. Can you imagine a day that you wake up to find, that all that was around you be nothing but a smog and prevent you to see and do anything? The car we have produce dangerous toxic that can up in are air and can be very hard for us later on. But if limit car usage, we can prevent this from happening. Not, just us but to other place in the world. This was what happen in France ,to prevent the usage for cars producin that smog they created an renforce day to prevent the use of car. Which lead to a shocking over turn of news. Like so in the following,""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" (Source #2) What I'm trying to inform once again is that we limit we can create a better fit living world to be in. This is one advantages that we can do as fellow citizens in our country

Which lead to me to my othe point, there is more that we have in advantage of limiting the usage of cars. It is a way of ""smart planing"" ourself as a community. We can live a more free caring world without the need of a car. Technology can play a part in the limit of of car usage. As stated in the folllowing ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" (Source #4)See this occur and happen this a will fitted advantage to us all. Another, advantage that we have in hand is the ability to relieve our stress level to a much stable level. which lead to me to my other insight of information, ""When I had a car I was alwaystense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter"" (Source #1) Being in the car makes it complicated and diifficult. This is another way for us take advantage to limit the use of cars.

In conclusion, there are many advantegous for that we can benifit from that if we limit the use of care by lower pollution in are atmospher, creating a more benficial way for ouself without the need of a car, the relive of oneself.

But now i see we need to have a change and just start walking and finding another way other then our cars because they are talking about fining and impounding our cars the ones (Cars) we paid full cash for.

To start off with, accroding to the article in ''Life Goes On Without Cars'', u could park at a garage but its gotta be ownship and u would have to buy space that cost $40,000, along with a home. For example, u would have to buy a house pay for that rent and also pay for the parking fee that u brought with the house. So with that being said u should just buy a house, and not own a car and just walk, ride a bike ,or take a bus to where every u got to go.

Secondly, now there saying in article ''Driving due to smog'' On Monday motorists with-numbered licence plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31).The same would apply to odd-numbered plated the following the day. That's not right because you brought your  car, but you could only drive it a certain day (would ever the law says). The understanding that I'm getting is you got to follow the law rules when ever that applies to the goverment people, which is understandable. But my point is I brought my car and i should be able to drive my car when ever I feel like it.

Futher more, Now they  want to have a ''Car Free Day'' In the article Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, they say millions of Colombins hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. For example, If the people did drive on a car-free day they would face $25 fine. So if it rained and u needed to get somewhere you could't drive u would have to take a bus, walk, train, or skate. Or you would be fined.

In Closing, from the understanding that I'm getting,  I advise everyone to take the bus,walk,skate,bike,or hike just to get to where you got to be also you could just not own a car. Because either way, if u break the rules you are going to be to be fine or  they could impounded your car and thats would be a lot of mess  becasue you paid for a car but u gotta pay the fine and pay to get your car out the impounded. So EVERYONE just walk,bike,hike,skate,or take a train or bus.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
33AC59C82DE5,"Many people in the United States are becoming more and more aware of the advantages of limiting car usage. Many don't find this important or feel uncomfortable adapting new customs but it is very important to limit car usage. Limiting car usage contributes to many factors in cities and can also help the environment.

First of all, limiting car usage contributes to the way cities, towns, or suburbs are. For example; The first article ""Car-Free Cities"" shows an example of a suburb in Germany where people have given up their cars. This suburb; Vauban, Germany, has been a success and even 57 percent of the people living there have sold their cars in order to live there, while 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. A media trainer, Heidrn Walter, said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I', much happier this way,"" and it's not only her that feels this way, many otheer people in this suburb have experienced and enjoyed the no-car-feeling. Also, this article states that a low-car suburban life makes suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. This makes living there a lot more easier and comfortable.

Second, limiting car usage helps the environment. According to the first article; ""Car-Free-Cities"" says that ""Passenger cars are responcible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" and that ""emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" These two facts show how bad cars are for the environment, and not only that, but also, cars polute the air horribly. For example, in the second article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" said that ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This smog has affected a lot of cities as well and now one of the main goals people have is to promote alternative transportation due to this.

To conclude, there are many advantages of limiting car usage and and not limiting is hurting the world. Everyone should be more conciderate of their environment and limit their car usage.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
0E66C9CE5B7C,"Limiting car usage could have many advantages on our planet. Many cities, such as Vauban in Germany, have given up on using cars to help the world around them. ""Vauban's streets are completely car-free, except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community."" There is a movement going on called, ""smart planning"" and Vauban is just one example of a growing trend in Europe of limiting auto use. The article says that passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. It seems that the people in Europe are realzing that so much car usage is harming their environment, and they are trying to set a trend for other countries like the United States to follow to limit using cars.

How much people use their cars is very important. Polluted air is a very widespread problem in many regions of the world. Paris had days of near-record pollution, and decided to enfore a partial driving ban to try to help clear the air of the city. The article says that almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and twenty-seven had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog."" The driving ban helped clear the smog, because it reduced car emissions. Paris has more smog than many other European capitals, which is why reducing how much citizens drive their cars is a good idea.

Some cities have days that are completely car free. Bogota, Colombia is one of them. They have been having a Day Without Cars for three straight years. Cars are banned for the day and buses and taxis are the only exception. The city holds about 7 milion people, and had a large turnout. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay even said that, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" The Day Without Cars has even helped stores and sports center come up throughout the city. Instead of shopping centers along a highway, those stores are now in the city and easy to get to without having to use a car.

Researchers have been studying America's ways of car usage and driving. America is home to the first cars like the Model T, or ""Mustang Sally."" Vehichles have always been a huge part of culture, but it seems now that that might not be the case anymore. ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" Researchers are actually hoping that the pattern continues because it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions on the environment. Transportation is the second largest source, behind power plants, of emissions. Many changes have now happened in America, which are making using cars not as important. ""With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.."" The article says. If we could slow down the usage of cars and emission, maybe we could help the planet become a better place.

Since the percentage of car usage has gone down in America, so has the percentage of getting a license. There has been a large drop in 16-39 year olds getting a license, Mr. Sivak's research has found. Older people are also likely to retain their licenses as they age. Mr. Sivak and another man both have children of about the same age, 19 and 21, and live in busy cities where a car could be useful. Neither one of them has their licenses, even though they are interested, but they don't really see the need for one when they can use public transportation or car-pool with their friends. The article says that a study last year has also found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Whether or not this changes as these young people grow older, these decreases in driving are proving that cars might just not be as important as they used to be.

Our planet is just continuing to get worse from emissions from cars. Some countries are starting to realize this and are working hard to limit car usage and have citizens rely just on public transportation, walking, or riding a bike. Bill Ford proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety."" Citizens all over the world can work together to reduce car usage and better improve our planet.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
5A3EB7A7A627,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. for example, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Another example is that all around the world there are attempts to make suburbs and communitys more compact and more accessible to public transportation with less parking spaces. This is a new approach in which stores are placed a walk away or on a main street. Not like malls who usually are along some distant highway. In vauban 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here. In the united states the environmental protection acency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities like vauban.

In paris after near-record pollution they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On monday even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave there cars at home of the would have to pay $31. they did the same for the odd-numbered plates the followinf day. Almost 4,000 people were fined. One good thing though is that congestion was down 60 percent in the capital france, after 5 days of intenssifying smog. Paris typically has more smog than other european capitals. In Bogota, Colombia millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car free day. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Carlos Arturo Plaza a businessman said ""it was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" He was riding a two-seat bike with his wife.

In the United States recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. This has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: has america passed peak driving? When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Dough Short of advisor perspectives, an investment company. A sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its mobilities research and policy center, MiMi Sheller said that ""different things are converging which suggests that we are witnessing a long term cultural shift"". She says it allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet people. Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. Mr. Sivak's research has found that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. A study found that driving by a young age decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

As you can tell the advantages of limiting car usage are that it helps clear the air, reduce smog and take stress away. It also lowers air pollution and helps with making the greenhouse gas emissions in europe go down. Another thing is that it is a great way to promote alternative transportation. These are some on the many advantages of limiting car usage.                    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
30B80CDBD018,"A decline in the use of motor vehicles would greatly help the whole world in many unique ways. Most importantly, cars have an awful effect on the enviornment. Eliminating motor vehicles all together would remove many of the polutants effecting the eviornment. Also, removing cars has a great effect on the community as well by helping places to grow and prosper. Finally, the thought of limiting car usage is trending rapidly with the common man as well as higher ups in the government.

Cars produce up to 12% of Europe's greenhouse gases and up too 50% of America's greenhouse gas. High levels of greenhouse gas absorb heat and prevent it from leaving Earth's atmosphere causing a rise in temperature better known as global warming. Second, the carbon monoxide and other noxious chemicals that are released by vehicles can come together to form a thick smog. This somg is very bad for people's health and can contaminate land and water with toxic chemicals. In order to prevent these two things a lack of usage of cars is necesary in today's world.

Just like the enviornment, reduced car usage also can benifit your very own community. Citizens reported being ""much happier this way"" as well as being less tense after restrictions on cars were imposed. Second, a lack of car usage would caue much denser cities. In turn, buisness that were staged on highways would become local and  city centers would allow friends to live close by. Finally, in cities that imposed bans on motor vehicles parks and sports centers were not only revived but began to completely flourish.

Finally, laws about car usage are smiled upon by both pedestrians but by people in legislative positions. Fist off, European places like Switzerland and France first adopted these types of rules. As a result, events like car free day in Bogota became a big sucess with many supporters. Therefore, even president Barack Obama revealved a plan to be imposed that limits the usage of cars in America. Finally, sociological professors like Mimi Sheller have noticed people accepting and embracing the new anti car policies.

In turn, restricting car usage has nothing but good to offer the majority of cities. From helping reduce the global problem of polution. Or, helping to build bigger more tightly knit cities. The new very popular laws will be imposed in many Eurpoean countires and sonn the U.S. As a result, the positive effects will be embraced by communities for generations to come.

Some pros about not having cars are that more people are exercising and losing weight, and reducing the pollution in the air. Some even say you can get where you're going faster when not using a automobile.

Many of the problems that create this are the densely populated areas with high car usage. In Europe in 2006 there government finished construction on a town that had no garages or drive ways, the only place to park was a garage that you had to buy a spot in for $40,000 witch you payed for along with your house.

During their last year millions of people walked on their car-free day even when it rained showing that people want to make a difference and positively help their enviroment.

In some areas like Paris where pollutants are at 147 micrograms per cubic meter drastic actions had to made during its peak on smog. The city of Paris put a partial ban on driving reducing the smog by 60 percent.

Some communities like Vauban, Germany have created car free suburbs and building lifestyle around that. Instead of large suburbs like we have here in the States they have focused on making shopping within walking distance. People of Vauban have been reported to being less stressed and more happy after living in a car free community. However; this is not the most practical here efforts can be made to redesign how we live such as making super markets easier to access on an everyday basis and only buying the groceries that you need for a couple of days instead of a week or two. This trend has brought people from all over Germany to live there and has set a trend changing how other communites live there lifestyle.

Giving up cars has can build a better life for you and the planet by reducing pollution and lowering your stress but it in order for its full benefits it needs to be done as a community.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
AEA5258DB0D5,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage, for exmple, it lowers the amount of emmisons present in the atmosphere which can lead to a better planet. All around the world people have started using cars less and less because of the problems they cause, such as polution and traffic, and have started moving to a better idea of society where everyone lives in a closer area with stores and jobs within walking distance. The life of cars is ending but our life is just getting better.

Since the times of World War 2, people have had the idea of spread-out homes and private garages but with new times come new ideas, new ideas of closer centered, compact cities. These new cities would have most shops and businesses in close quarters with housing to reduce the need for automobiles and have walking as a more reliable mode of transportation as well as a small amount of public transportation to assist with the more lengthy distances between home and work. In this new approach stores are placed closer to home along walkways rather than in malls along highways in the distance. This would reduce the space needed for the shopping centers as well due to the fact that they would no longer need large parking lots for all the vehicles that were once needed to commute to and fro.

Emissions and greenhouse gases have been a problem in modern society due to the fact that almost everyone has an automobile. This has been creating a large amount of stress on the enviroment and can lead to problems in the near future. Because of these problems, many enviomental agencies have started regulating car usage to try to keep the enviroment safe. Some of the ways they are doing this include promoting ""car reduced"" communities, which rely more on public transportation serving the suburbs than personal transportation. This helps to cut down on traffic and in turn the amount of emissions produced by cars on the road. Another way to prevent this is to ban the act of driving all together. Paris has done this in the past to combat the amount of smog accumulating in their city by banning the driving of certain license plate numbers which reduced the amount of traffic and emissions.

Car free cities are also very popular. an example of this is Bogota, Columbia. They have had cars banned for the last three years, minus buses and taxis. The goal of this project was to promote alternate means of transportation and reduce smog. This has created over 118 miles in bicycle paths as well as broad smooth sidewalks. The amount has traffic has also been cut in half during rush-hour thanks to new restrictions. New retaurants and upscale shopping has also come up all around the area. The amount of smag has also been reduced significantly and air quality has made a huge jump.

Overall, the age of the  car is coming to an end, but it is making our life better and easier. Hopefully these new restrictions and ideas will help us to reduce smog, cut down on traffic and produce a better, more stress-free, lifestyle. Then, maybe we can all become ""Urban /k/ommandos"" someday. The term ""Urban /k/ommando"" is trademark of the /k/ Branch of 4Chan. org and is not to be used by any parties who do not assume the responsibilities of carrying this title.             ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

As towns such as Vauban and Paris participate in car free days, they greatly reduce the amount of pollution that would have become that day. their hard work and enthusiasm even encouraged other cities and parts of the country to join. our pollution rate is much to high for the only planet and space we can live on. increasing it daily will only hurt us and be fatal in the long run.

Death rates caused by cars is another reason to have a few days off from them. Fatalaties caused in accidents, hit and runs, and wrecks happen multiple times daily. a few days or even just one of no/reduced car usage could save the lives of many.

money costs are a large complaint in our society today, especially money involving cars. from the cost of the car itself to the dollars to per gallon used every week, nobody likes to spend that much money on their vehicle. well we wouldnt have to as often if we did have dayswhere cars were fined if used.

Three advantages of limiting car usage are less pollution,more time and healty life,and it improves safety.

To begin with cars have givin us both advantages like faster traveling time but they have also given us disadvantages. Most of us can agree that cars have caused some of the pollution that we have now. The cold nights and warm days have caused th car emissions to be traped in our atomsphere. In Paris,one of the biggest capital has a big amount of cars that nearly had a new record of pollution. Acording to

Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the new york times ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.""

Research has also found out that Paris have more smog then any other European capitals. After not using their cars the smog quickly reduce. In the capital of France congestion was 60 percent down after five-days of being unable to use their cars.

Another thing that is also giving us a more healty live and more time.

""Rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"" according to Andrew Selsky, from the seattle times.

A businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""

It's a Good opportuinty to take away stress and low air pollution.""

Parks and sports centers are now starting to get bigger and appear more through the city. More people have also started using the sidewalks or get on a bicycle. Malls are now closer, leaving you able to walk to it. You can now hear the swishs of bicycles and children talking instead of the sounds of cars.

Last of all,it improves safety of many people. Since there are less cars on the street there are less chances of car crashes. Parents can know be less worried about their child being run over. Car crashes caused by drunk drivers are also less liklely to happen. People now take public transportations or car-pool with friends making it more safer.

In conclusion, car have been around for a long time. They have givin us advantages and disadvantages. There are many advantages towards limiting car usage. Three of these reasons are less pollution,more time and healty life,and it improves safety.                                ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E4F9E557F03B,"Every day more and more people are surrounded by a toxic smog. This is caused by burning fossil fuels like gasoline, oil, and natural gasses. One of the main reasons toxic smog comes up is because of the mass amounts of vehicles on the road. Organizations and governments from around the word are trying to find a solution to our pollution problem. But when you think about it a car free world wouldnt be all that bad.

There are many pros for limiting car use. imagine breathing in the fresh air and seeing the beutiful skys above smog free, governments from around the world already see this dream and they want to make it into a reality. ""after days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" said Robert Duffer author of the article Paris bans driving due to smog. Cities around the world are trying to find new ways to reduce pollution from massive cities. Its a wonderful idea especialy since Paris rivaled Beijing China possibly the most polluted place in the world.

But when we get rid of all of the cars then what will be our means of transportation new ideas have scattered across the globe. Many countries are starting to rely on trains to move their citizens from one place to another and with revolutionary technology trains are now faster than ever. How many parking lots are in your city? thats another thing without parking lots cities wil be more open and more stores and super markets will take their place. More and more countries start to relize that reducing vehicle emissions will make the quality of life in their city higher and cleaner and it apears that the ideas are taking action ""a program that's set to spread toother countries, millions of columbians hiked, biked, and skated or took buses to work during a car-free day"". said Andrew Selsky author of Car-free day spinning into a big hit in Bogota. Cities are now taking action and are helping the enviorment by starting days where no cars are allowed. this is one example of how many countries are going green and helping the enviorment.

With plenty of ways of reducing gas emissions the world will soon take a turn for the best being able to reduce pollution and make the overall populatin happy. more and more means of transportation pop up every day so just wait and you will see an impact on your comuntiy as well. in the mean time hop on you bike and go green the change starts with you.                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In the story ""

Paris bans driving due to smog""

talks about how after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It says that on Mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day, I think that this should happen all around the world, so the world can be a better palce to live in. Here is a fact form the stroy, "" Paris typically has more smog then other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had a 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London"". The 3rd stroy was about how in Bogota, Comlombia they do a car-free day, now that should be done here in the U.S.. It says that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during car-free day, that the streets of the captial city eerily devoid of traffic jams, and that the rain has not stopped people from participating.

The last stroy talks about how the car culture is coming to an end, but i really hope not and i think not. It is here ,in the U.S., the birthpalce of the Model T, a classic car that i love and i would hope so that a lot of more people do too; the home of Detroit, what i know is that they make cars up there; tha place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""Mustang Sally"", I do not know what that is but it does sound important.

9F9A56C3517E,"Cars are magnificent machines. They allows to travel in much quicker ways than just walking or taking the bus, but have you ever thought about what these machines are doing to our environment? Although you may not think of it, cars create alot of smog, daily. ""Passenger cars are  responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the Unted States"" (source 1: paragraph 5). While this may not seem like a big deal, smog can actually kill you if too much is inhaled. So what do we do to prevent this?

Vauban, Germany, A place you've probably never heard of before. It's a place for more upscale residents. The great thing about it is that they have given up cars for good. ""70 percent of Vauban's familes do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" (source 1: paragraph 3). Paris has also decided to jump on this bandwagon, but in a way a little different than Germany's. They have accumulated so much smog that they started giving out fines for those driving on certain days in order to let the environment naturally clear out all the smog. ""On monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" (source 2: paragraph 11). Along with Paris and Germany, Columbia has created a day deticated to no driving. It is called the ""Day Without Cars"" and citizens of this area are not aloud to drive on this day(source 3: paragraph 21). This event spread throughout Columbia and is now spreading throughout the world.

So why is all this happening and how are people taking the step to prevent smog? ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...."" (source 4: paragraph 41). What are possible factors of this? ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van serices for getting to work."" (source 4: paragraph 35). As The End of Car Culture tells us, alot more young people are becoming less and less interested in cars due to cellphones. Also it is shown us that the denser the area is with cars, the more people have chosen to take bicycles to work or even just walk because they don't want to deal with the traffic.

Many people have taken the step to encourage a healthier environment without cars. Some banned driving for good, some created a holiday dedicated to no driving for a day, and some just stopped it for a while by handing out fines. There are many alternate ways of transportation such as walking and biking, but are you willing take the step, to give up cars, and to change you lifestyle for the better, or will you continue to hurt the environment by driving and contributing to the smog? Will you join the few that have made the change or continue following everyone else? A world without cars is a better one. One with less smog and less aggrevation. A happier place, more peaceful and relaxing. Your choice, your life, pick a side, and choose wisely.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

'In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'

,

'Paris bans driving dye to smog'

, and

'Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota'

, there are many advantages that can come with the limiting of car usage.

Elisabeth Rosenthal mentions many of these in her article about Vauban, Germany. One woman she quoted in the third paragraph, Heidrun Walter, says ""

When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.

"" Not everyone may feel less tense after getting rid of their car, but it would definitely be a great thing. Another advatage that came with less car usage in Vauban that Rosenthal mentions in her article, is that stores started getting built about a walk away instead of in malls miles away. This is obviously an amazing point because everyone still has needs they must buy or tend to and it's much better if the places they buy the things they need are in walking distance because no one would need to use distance as an excuse to use their car.

In the fifth paragraph of Duffer's article, he makes sure to mention that car traffic was down 60% in Paris after they decided to enforce a partial ban on driving to also clear the air. If we limit car usage, their would be way less traffic, which means less time sitting in our cars aggravated about the fact that we're stuck and need to get to school or work soon or else we'll be late.

In the third article, which is written by Andrew Selsky he reports that in Bogota on their ""

car-free day

"" there was little to no traffic, and the annual event has reduced smog. In the fifth paragraph, he quoted a businessman named Carlos Arturo Plaza. Carlos says that the event is ""

a good oppurtinity to take away stress and lower air pollution.

"" The day without cars inspires you to find alternative transportation methods, which can be as simple as walking or even riding a bike which are both really healthy and great ways to get your excersise in! Selsky also notes that the day without cars has sparked the construction of more bicycle paths, bigger, nicer sidewalks and more parks and sports centers have popped up around the city. Clearly in Bogota they are taking advantage of keeping their air healthy by trying to inspire their residents to be and stay healthy as well.

To begin with, there are thousands of cars in the world and it keeps on increasing, we'll have less traffic is we start to limit car usage. This is clear in source 3, it says ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" This shows that people can use other ways to transport to one play to another, they wont have to use a car and there will be no taffic any where. Therefore, its better to have no traffic involved you'll get to places faster then usaully.

Additionally, people stress alot over things and walking can help you stress less. In source 3, it says ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower pollution."" This says this can benefit for you so yould't have to overthink things. Therefore, walking to your jobs, school, stores and any where you want to good can help you release stress.

Moreover, less teens will be getting license so there will be less car accidents.

This is clear in source 4, ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009."" This means that the less teens will get inyo car accidents which means the growth population will be increasing not decreasing. Therefore, the less teens get license the less accidents occurs.

In conclusin, there are many benefits in limiting car usage. Less pollution, no more traffic, less stress, and less teens will get their license. The more we do this the more we get use to it so we wont complain about anything. I urge you to stop using your car less because it will help you in some way.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

This dramatic change has been a eye opener to many communities in different countries all over the world. It has really helped with the enviroment and brought a postive impact on communities in various ways.

To begin, the limiting of car usage has brought out a positive result in the environment. According to the excerpt from ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Due to the partial driving ban, the smog was able to be cleared sooner than later.

Although that may be reasonable, a testimomony from a businessman in Bogota explains that it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.

To continue on, the limiting of car usage has also brought a positive impact many communties in different countries. This new adjustment has created a domino effect as many countries take on the challenge. In the excerpt from ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", author Andrew Selsky explains that parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.

According to the excerpt, Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"". This advantage could be the change of a lifetime for many communities. And it might be just the thing they need.

One citizen said ""when i had a car i was always so tense  im so much happier this way"". So clearly the the reason why the citizens enjoy not having a car was maybe because, they didnt have to worry about all the expences like gas and car insurance to take care of a car.

Another reason why its good to limit the use of cars is because of the nasty Co2  gas that come out of the of the muffler and polluts the air. Car pollution became so bad that the city of paris put a partial ban on driving to clear the the air of the city. By doing this the air pollution ""was down by 60"" witch the artical states in paragraph 14. This is a good  thing becase france has a higher pollution rate than other european citys.

With America's car culture seemingly coming to an end, there will be more alternative ways to get to work, school, shopping districts, and etc. As the years come and go by quickly, Americans are buying less cars and obtaining fewer licenses for themselves. The advantages we can recieve by limiting our car usage is that it takes away stress, lowers air pollution, and benefits daily businesses.

First, Limiting car usage takes away stress. As businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states:""It's a good opportunity to take away stress...""  People who no longer own a car will not have to worry as much about their car. Such as the price of gas rising, car payments, and insurance payments. These type of payments every month often put a big dent in a person's wallet. If we take up to the oppurtunity of limiting our car usage, we really won't have to worry about car payments anymore. Plus, being outside in the environment will certainly reduce stress levels almost completely, because we are interacting with others that are waliking and enjoying the the environment outside.

In addition to, taking away stress. Limiting car usage will result in lower air pollution. According to Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" If we limit car usage, the levels of air pollution will dramatically decrease resulting in cleaner air and a healthy environment for us to live in. If we continue to use cars, we are further damaging the air that we breathe everyday and causing people to damage their lungs. Pollution often has chemicals that can harm our breathing and sometimes our lungs. As Americans it is our responsibility to take care of the earth and we are not doing so by constently using our cars.

Lastly, limiting car usage benefits daily businesses. Selsky staes: ""Parks and sport centers also have bloomed throughout the city; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. If we rely on walking to stores, etc. that are only a block away, it will surely increase the revunue of restaurants and shopping districts. Since the stores are so close to home, we'll be more willing to enter the store and/or restaurant. Increasing businesses revunue also helps the economy, which we desperately need.

In conclusion, these advantages that we have gone over in the essay will greatly impact the future of America. Such as,  taking away stress from former car owners, lowering the air pollution so we have a cleaner air to breathe, and beneifiting our daily businesses to increase revunue and better our economy. If we all limit car usage and follow the advantages listed, it will result in a better earth for us to live in.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

People don't usually tend to think that driving is hurting the Earth, but that is exactly what it is doing. Smog is a big issue in cities like New York and Paris. Not only is it unsafe for the environment, but it is also unhealthy for humans.

Big cities have recently started doing ""Car-Free"" days where no one is allowed to drive. If a person does drive, they will get fined. City officials are doing this in an attempt to cut back on the air pollution and smog that cars cause. In a sense, they are saving the world that we live in. In the third article, Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Another wonderful thing about limiting car use is this: It saves money. Gasoline is so expensive today. It is stressful to have to pay so much money for it. The prices constantly fluctuate and it's hard to keep up with. Yes, public transportation costs money. But it doesn't cost nearly as much as it would to fill up your whole gas tank.

A big problem in America is obesity. I think that this is partially because nobody ever needs to get up and really walk anywhere. Our car keys are at our fingertips and since we can so easily drive, we see no reason in travelling anywhere close in any other way. I believe that obesity in America would be greatly reduced if car use was limited. People would be out walking more and they would be engaging in more physical activity than ever before. It can do nothing but good for all of us.

I understand that some people label limiting car usage as ""unnatural"", but I don't think those people really consider all of the goodness in it. There are many advantages in not being so reliant on cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is not just the latest fad, but a new way of protecting the Earth and it's people. It is a way to keep the environment clean and functioning properly, as it should be. It is a way to make humans healthier and happier. I honestly believe that being less reliant on cars is a great thing, and I believe that it is the direction in which we need to go.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

limiting on car usage

"" seems to be a very aggravating phrase for an entire population of people who have become so dependent on it. It's a concept that we can't take in. We Americans use our cars for a personal use daily. We are so accustomed to our cars that we just use it to perform simple tasks that we could use our legs that were given to us, for free, to cross the street. When the average person says that they would like to go to the market across the street, probably about 70%, don't even think about the fact that we could just simply walk there. Cars are endarging our environment and our health. Cars create so much pollution and is a health-risk. Our cars seem to be as important as one of our limbs. Something you could not bare to live without. Now here are some of the reasons why.

To begin with, cars are polluting our atmosphere. Have you ever heard of the ""green house effect""? It's endangering our Earth, by polluting it, which is contributing to Global Warming. Cars are something we shouldn't always rely on. We have to get accustomed to the way of the pioneers. We all just need to limit the amount of times we use our cars and think, ""hmm.. do i really need to use my car right now? Can't i just use my two working legs to get to where i want to go, which is right down the block."" In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", paragraph 5; lines 6-9, the article states that, and i quote, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas of the United States."" Which is a whole lot of damage we are enflicting our own envirnment that we need to thrive on and live off. In reality, cars are overrated. We don't always need it, so we shouldn't always use it.

In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", paragraph 12; lines 1-3, it states, ""congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after 5-days of intensifying smog."" Imagine all of that pollution on this earth if we kept using our cars, which are slowly killing us.

Not only do cars endanger our environment, but it also creates a huge health-risk factor.

Cars can make us become lazy. We can use our cars so much to the point where we could  get accustomed to cars and grow tired and weary of using our legs. We may as well just live in a car. Cars could also create lots of stress. In artcile ""Car-free day is spinning a big hit in Bogota."", paragraph 5; lines 1-2, the author interviews someone and that person claims that, "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air-pollution.""

In Conclusion, we together as a whole should limit our car usage to cut back on pollution. We should all learn to be in touch with our environment and to just walk around in our clean, eco-friendly air. If we cut back, we wouldn't have to be worried about Global Warming anymore. We would all be closer, one step at a time.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D2BB8E9332D1,"LIVING CAR-LESSLY

There's a revolution that stands before us in the form of a new lifestyle: Car-free living. Taking the globe by storm this global phenomenon presents us with a more efficient enviornment, a huge drop in car accident tragedies, and a more functionable lifestyle.

First and foremost, the given: a better enviornment. Air pollution is a global issue that has become very previlant in our society today. In places such as Paris, France, extremes as far as fines for those who drive around in cars are enforced as a way to fight it's overly dense smog. Also, the president of the United States, Barrack Obama, has set a goal to curb the greenhouse gas emissions in the country. When government iniative are set to such its obvious that it's becoming an issue. If everyone begins to enforce a car free lifesyle then the world will reach a tremendous turning point and will be able to preserve our planet for the future generations.

Furthermore, it is known that car accidents are a common occuring issue whether it be small or deadly. Intoxicated or sober accidents can be just as bad. There will be no more bikers or pedestrians being hit and need to hitch hike will no longer be an issue as well. If we remove cars form our lives then we get the advantage of putting our society in a more safe way to transport.

Finally, car free lving will make us a more functionable lifestyle. The need of having to go so far for simple things will no longer be an issue due to the fact that everything that would be essential would be easier and closer to assess. People would begin walking more which would very much so decrease the obesity rates in many places. Also the expanison of public transportation will mean that people are more likely to have a more direct stop near the places they go.

In sumation, living car-lessly is a life lived less carelessly. It brings a coupious amount of advantages which means that everyone will have a safer, more funcitonable, and efficient lifestyle.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
1EB2AB9D50B1,"Did you ever wonder if limiting car usage is a good idea?

Limiting car usage can be a good idea in some ways. Some ways limiting car usage could be a good idea is by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, clearing the air of pollution, saving time, conserving rescources, and improving safety.

To start off, limiting car usage can be good in many ways. For example, by limiting car usage we could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. According to Source 1:

In

German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , paragraph 5 says that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. That is alot. With that amount of greenhouse gas gone, the air can be cleaner.

In addition, limiting car usage can also be a good idea for clearing the air from smog and pollution. For example, in Source 2:

Paris bans driving due to smog , a law was enforced to help clear the smog and pollution. On Mondays, people with even numbered licence plates could not drive. If they decided to drive they were given a fine of 31 dollars. This ban helped clear congestion by 60 percent in the capital of France.

Thirdly, the limiting of car usage could conserve rescources. If people do not drive we could save gas and oil to use it for something other than cars. People would also save money by not having to by gas or oil.

To conclude, limiting car usage could be good in many ways. If we want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, clear the air of smog and pollution, or even conserve our rescources, we should limit our car usage.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
84D540E7908D,"Throughout time, pollution has been known to be a huge environmental problem. The excessive amount of individual car owners driving down streets is in no way helping this issue. Efforts to diminish the number of cars we see on our roads have been taking place in order to help the environment and therefore citizens as well.

It is no news that passenger cars are harmful to the environment. They release gases that pollute the air we breathe affecting not only us but the environment as a whole. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States (Source 1). This realization has led to the promotion of ""car-reduced"" communites by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (Source 1). But the problem is more widespread than that. Paris has acknowledged the importance of this issue after witnessing smog that rivaled Beijing, China, known as one of the most polluted cities in the world (Source 2). Paris's solution was to enforce a driving ban in order to help clear its air. Due to this ban, congestion was down 60 percent shortly after the intensifying smog (Source 2). It is a known fact that transportation is America's second largest source of emissions, therefore, limiting passenger car usage can greatly benefit the environment as well as citizens' everyday lives.

Limiting car usage has not only proven to be helpful towards the environment but towards citizens as well. With a decrease in car usage comes new benefits not just to individual citizens but to communities. Less cars means less time in irritating traffic. Usually, car traffic and traffic jams leads to huge amounts of stress. This is because the idea of not getting to work is stressful; not getting to work means losing money. Losing money adds even more stress. But when limiting car usage, losing money is not an issue one has to think about. Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees by stating that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" (Source 3). Rush-hour restrictions and other efforts towards limiting car usage have cut traffic making it easier for citizens to get to their jobs (Source 4). Those who choose other forms of transportation that are less harmful to the environment have even less of a problem and appear to be much happier. Heldrun Walter states that when she had a car she was always tense but now she is much happier (Source 1). The evidence has proven that limiting car usage is benefical to not only the environment but to citizens' daily life as well.

Keeping a clean environment is something of major importance. If one does not take care of the environment there will seize to be a healthy environment in which to live in. Limiting car usage is a big step when it comes to keeping the environment free of pollution. Not only is it beneficial to the environment but it helps citizens live a much happier life lessening the causes of stress. Limiting car usage helps the air needed to breathe, the money coming into your pockets, and one's overall happiness.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
9D46E8F0C62A,"In Vauban Germany, the people in the suburbs have stopped driving. Parking or housing a car predominately prohibited and the only vehicle you'd see is the tram that take citizens from the edge of the community or to downtown Freiburg. You can own a car, but the parking space is incredibly limited, sometimes even expensive.

The residents aren't complaining. 57% of the population even had sold their car to live in Vauban, one woman even stating she felt less tense without a vehicle.

The growing trend of reducing automotive use in suburban lifestyles is a role in a movement known as ""smart planning."" Cars are often heavily populated in the suburbs, which hinders the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas tailpipe emissions, as up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions in the US come from cars.

Many of the world is now slowly following Vauban's steps with actions like reducing the size of suburbs and and giving its residents more access to public transportation. Rather than creating distant malls along highways, stores are being placed on a main street that's a walk away.

In Paris, after dealing with a nearly record-high amount of smog, a driving ban was enforced to reduce and/or clear out the pollution. Public transit was free and the smog managed to clear enough that cars with odd-numbered plates were allowed to be put in use again.

Bogota, California also took part in a day without passenger vehicles, with only buses and taxis in commision. On Day Without Cars, 7 million people rode bikes, skated, hiked, or took a bus to their job. It's believed to help reduce pollution and reduce stress. Thanks to the day, parks and sport centers have appeared, sidewalks made smoother and broadened, rush-hour rules designed to cute traffic, and plenty of new shops and dining places within short distance.

Recents studies also appear reveal a decrease in car purchases as time passes, raising the question of America's interest in automotives and driving. As of 2013, an average person drove 9% below the peak, identical to where is was in 1995. While the price of cars is a factor taken into consideration, the decrease hopefully hints to a more permanent drop in car use.

With this comes a benificial lessen of carbon emmissions, conserve resources and improve safety. Only time will tell where it will go from here.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

63678A1DF932,"Driving at times can be a really big issue to deal with. There are so many thing that can go wrong, a crash, then increase in insurence, you might even get your license taken away after that. When you don't drive, the world is an open book just waiting to be read. Walking or riding bikes can relieve stress and make you more fit and in shape. The gasses that come from cars are just aweful for the environment, and there would be such a largly reduced number in traffic jams if pleople would just get off the road. Once your on the road, anything can happen. It's dangerous, i sometimes even wonder if i really want a license.

When you drive there are so many traffic jams. The idea of never having to worry about traffic again is intriguing. Why worry about having to rush through traffic just to get to work on time, when instead you can simply manage your time correctly and walk at the pace you are comfortable with. Traffic jams cause accidents that put peoples lives at risk. In the article, ''Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Botoga'' by Andrew Selsky, he states, ''...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams''. The car-free day in Colombia is working to perfection to promote alternative transportation, i don't see why we dont have this in the United States.

Drivig causes stress and tension and that's never good. A stressed driver is a dangerous driver, when you're stressed you become more careless and less aware of your surroundings and that is very dangerous as a driver it leads to wreckless driving and accidents. Being without a car relieves this stress for many people. In the article, ''In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'' by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a quote from the article states, ''When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,'' said Heidrun Walter. This shows that cars are a lot to handle and that most people just believe it is too much stress for one person to deal with.

The smog and pollution caused by all the cars that are on the road these days is another reason why it is best to stay off the road. In the article, ''Paris bans driving due to smog'' by Robert Duffer, he says, ''[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world''. The cities ban on cars on the road shows a serious concern in the saftey of the people because of all the smog that driving has caused.

Some people might argue that cars would be faster, but if you take a car you are going to be mor at risk of an accident, you're going to be polluting the air, and you'll only be stressing yourself out in the process. I strongly suggest that America does something to change our ways, because if we don't, we'll end up like Beijing and Paris with an extremly high pollution rate.

7EC34F21069A,"As the years go by,  so does the evolution of automobiles and the effect it carries in our environment. Technology changes the way we move and interact with one another, some for the better and others for the worst. Limiting car usage will help individuals carry themselves in their environment because it will cause less pollution and less accidents.

Earth's atmosphere is slowly starting to change due to the fact that chemicals and gases are being released from your very own car. As Amercia's population increases so do the risk of the the greenhouse gases, resulting in global warmming and the lost of some habbitats. ""If the pattern persists .... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"",(Rosenthal 34). Stopping the usage of cars in our society will help protect not only ourselves but also the lives of those with whom you share with.

Imagine lossing your loved one in a car accident and never hearing from her or him again. As Amercia's population starts to increase so those it's migration stream, resulting in manufactoring and labor cost. If more cars are being released into our living, the lives of those in which we care will soon never be seen again. Limiting the usage of cars with help keep our enviromnet/society accident free and see those familar faces which we saw as we grew up. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city, uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, soomth sidewalks, rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"",(Selsky 28). A day without car will help the lives of many espically those around you.

When technology changes so does our ideas and perspective on our surroundings. Congestion causes stress and reduces the chance of a clear sky. Car usage changes the lives of many as well as impacts in what we care about and what we don't care about. Limiting car usage will help individuals carry themselves in their environment because it will cause less pollution and less accidents.                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Other's are trying to stop car pollution and limet the usage of them. Cars cause alot of smog wich then goes into the air and pollutes it. This is very bad, especially for our health. Were the one that breathe this air in and if its polluted we may become sick. It is also a good stress releiver since you dont have to be stuck in trafic or having to hear the car honk all day.

In source 1 ""German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars"" it talk abou how the people in Vauban, Germany do not use cars. Cars are allowed but people chose too not use them. 70 percent of Vauban's families to not own a car and some have even sold there to move there. Heidrum Walter said that when she had a car she was always tense and is more happier know that she dosen't own one. Vauban may be the most city in low-car suburban other part of the world are taking this as an example and trying it out to. More and more places around the world are making stores more near by or on a main street, rather than having them in a shopping center with a highway distant.

Parin,France is the city that has the most smog out of all cities in Europe. This means that the pollution rate is higher. Thats why acording to source 2 ,Paris enforeced a partial driving ban to help clear the air in the city. Citizens were ordered to leave there vehicles at home or pay a fine of $31. But this did not stop people from using cars almost 4,000 drivers were fined after this ban was enforced. The reason Paris had for doing this is because after five days of intensive smog the congestion was down by 60 percent. By enforcing this ban Paris was able to clear out the smog in 3 days and be back to normal on Tuesday.

I know that people may not want to give up using there cars, yes is an easier way to travel and get places faster. There right, but it would be better for the world and ourself if we could reduce the usage of cars not just in our cities but all over the world. Just how in Bogoa, Columbia they have car free days. People who live there have a car free day wich mean they biked, walked or took buses to all of the destenations they had that day. Bogota had been doing this for three consecutive years and the goal is to promote alternativ etransportation and reduce smog. Some people who live there say that by doing these they relieved stress. By Bogota doing this they have parks and sports centers, uneven sidewalks have been taking away and replaced with smooth sidewalks.

In the United States more and more people are buying less cars and fewer people get there licens as the years go by. Even though americans are know for ther big love on carr ,that seems to be reducing. This is very beneficial for carbon emmissions and the environment. People like Mimi Sheller a sociology professor at Drexel University researched different resources and said that the Internet makes telecommuting possible and we don't have to drive to a friend house to see them or talk to themm we can just use technology to do that. Also the percentage of people getting there license has chaged. People are finding ways to either walk, take public transportatio, or have somone cal-pool them ,rather than diving a car themselfs.

Their should definitley be a limiting of car usage because their would be less car accidents , people would be able to spend less money on cars and we would have less air pollution. Also having a car can cause a lot of stress or tension for people.

Obviously we're having a lot of problems with money in this world , if we limit car usage that would really help is us out a lot. See as it states in source one paragraph two '' A car-owner buys a space, for forty thousand dollars , along with a home.'' With those forty thousand dollars you can do a lot to help the world . It aslo says that fifty seven percent of the people who live in a suburban area sold their cars just move where they live at now. Who needs a car when you can just walk ''stores are placed a walk away, on a main street rather than the malls along some distant highway. ''source one paragraph 6.

Pollution is destroying our world and we need to help stop it, so here's an idea lets ban driving due to smog says Paris. Their was an enforced partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Do you agree with that? well I do and here's why . Paris has more smog than other European capitals so if they don't stop the smog it's going to be horrific for their city. Source three paragraph twenty one '' the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.'''Not having cars for one day is brilliant idea because is an improvement to the city of Bogota.

Their is a lot of disruptions an accidents going on because of cars mainly because of the traffic so if their was less cars it would be more peaceful. Usually when there's traffic you hear a lot honking and there's a lot fines for that. The fines are very expensive to pay so you're wasting a lot of money. Also when people are honking they don't realize that other people are sleeping . Everyone needs sleep , some people can't sleep through everything so all it takes is one honk and bam they're awake. Sleeping is really needed in your life imagine notgetting enough sleep because of traffic well yeah that would suck an a lot of people already go through that .

So in conclusion what I'm saying is car usage should definitly be limited at least in some countries or states. Money is a really big problem we have that needs to be solved and this is a great way. People living in a surburan area have to pay more just for extra parking places. Air pollution is very bad for the world with les cars that will stop as well.

Cars produce smog which goes up in to he air and is bassically what  created the greenhouse affect.

When people use cars they hardly dont ever think about what is actually happening while they use it, mostly whats thought about is how fast they are going or how much time they have left to get where they are going. When driving a car smog is released from the tail pipe and usually donsnt affect any on directly unless they are really close to it, but even then it is a momment of discnomfert nothing perminent. what most peoiple dont realize is that when smog is released from the car it gose directly up into our atmosphere. when there is an abundance of smog it acumulates creating a green house affect. what is needed to stop that is to stop driving ingeneral but scincde that cat be done do as paris has done and have sertain laws that prevent most people to drive on some day ""On monday motorist with even numbered license plates were to suffer a 22 euro fine then the same would apply to the odd numberd plates the next day."" this would make for people to stop driving so much ang just go for a walk to their location if it isnt too far.

Walking isnt as bad as most people would probably think it to be. Some people already do it on a normal basis. Some people could argue that the weather is to gloomy or its raining and they dont want to get wet. As the Mayor of bogota said ""The rain hasn't stopped me from participating."" More states should have a day with out cars like Bogota dose and have ""The day with out cars is part of an improvement"" and just like that as Bogota has done ""parks and sports centers will bloom"", ""New restaurants and upscale shopping districs will be cropped up.""

Americans without even realizing it have stopped driving. We have bought less cars and drivers licenses as each year gose buy. Which shows that there is a little bit of care towards the sitiation happening all around the world. Usually americans were the ones to be mostly using their cars but as the article states. ""Americans love affar with their cars have began cooling down."" Even thought the cars are still being used they are used much less than before.

The main problem for getting rid of private vehicals is that many cities cannot accomplish this kind of transportation. There are many small towns in America that do not have the ability to walk or bike across the long distances from the home to the downtown area. America depends on agriculture exports, so if we all convert to city life America wont have many exports left.

As the people in these countries have learned, there are many advantages to giving up drving cars, if even only for a few days rather than their entire lives.

The main advantage is a cleaner planet. Emissions that cars release play a large role in the world's air pollution. Carbon emissions create smog that makes the sky grey, damages our lungs, and harms the plants that give us clean air. Due to carbon emissions from cars, Paris once had as much smog as ""Beijjing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"" (Source 2). If we start driving less cars it will have really beneficial implications for the environment, especially ""... since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"" (Source 4).

One positive effect would be a lot less stress. Driving is a dangerous activity where you are constantly putting yourself at risk. Many people realize this and tend to be scared of driving or are constantly nervous when they drive. Rushing to drive to work on time also creates negative stress. Says German media trainer and mother, Heidrun Walter, of no longer owning a car, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Daily long commutes are also a large determining factor in someone's mood. Some people have to drive for hours a day just to get to their already stressful job and then again when they go back home. This creates for a very unhappy society. Now there are a couple of good things that come from a society that is no longer obsessed with car culture. One thing is that ""the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends"" (Source 4). This lessens the need have a car to take you to distant places. With the banning or lessening use of personal vehicles cities and towns are being rebuilt. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" (Source 1). This has encouraged healthier and cheaper modes of transportation such as walking, skating, bicycling, and public transportation such as buses.

Fewer cars and this rebuilding of cities saves you money and commute time. Just think about all those rising gas prices. You don't need to pay tolls when you walk, or get fined when you run too fast. Prices for parking spots and passing tolls are going up anyway. It's an easier and cheaper alternative to just walk or bike somewhere. Public transportation like buses and subways cost a lot less too. Studies have found that fewer people are buying cars and getting their licenses; it's for a reason.

Lastly, not only are leaders across the globe joining in on the idea of life without cars, but so are car-selling companies. ""Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themeselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"" (Source 4). Even Bill Ford, executive chariman of the Ford Motor Company proposed a business plan in which ""personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable."" Ford suggested becoming partners with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety"" (Source 4).

So next time you think about buying a new car or driving to work all buy yourself, try to rethink your actions and imagine the effect it will have on not only you, but everyone around you. Maybe you can bike to work if it's not that far, take the bus instead, carpool with some coworkers. The planet and future generations will thank you if you just limit your car usage, even a little bit at a time.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

1232E9091138,"Since the rise of suburbs nationally and globally, car culture has been an important component of our history and of the typical human experience. Every teenager anticipates the excitement and freedom of a driver's license, our country is ""the birthplace of the Model T"" and ""the home of Detroit,"" and mothers across the globe rely on SUVs and station wagons to haul their children to and from school, soccer practice, Sunday mass, and the like (Source 4). In recent years, however, there is a growing trend of limited car usage around the world as countries promote vehicle-free neighborhoods and as in nations like the USA, ""there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year olds getting a license,"" (Source 4). This trend, while seemingly alarming in our technology-dependent universe, offers several advantages, from a better environment to healthier citizens and communities, and encouraging and promoting this pattern may just be as revolutionary for the planet as the introduction of the first car over a century ago.

From France to Colombia, first of all, governments have been encouraging limited car usage as a means to better the environment through the reduction of toxic emissions into our atmosphere - after all, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States,"" (source 1). As debates have run rampant around the world about global warming and air pollution, several nations have taken initiative and experimented with the effects of this idea. In the district of Vauban, Germany, for instance, ""street parking, driveways and home garges are generally forbidden,"" and as a result of expensive parking spots for those who do choose to operate their vehicles - upwards of $40,000 a pop - ""70% of Vauban's families do not own cars,"" (Source 1). Limited car usage and public transportation is alternatively being promoted in Germany and elsewhere as an attempt to live our day-to-day lives in a way that is healthier for ourselves and the planet. France is one such example - in Paris, for instance, ""one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" ""near-record pollution""  led officials to impose a driving ban to help clear the air, and almost 4,000 were ticketed with a $31 fine as a result of not following orders (Source 2). Free public transit was offered, and a result of the actions of the ruling party, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog,"" (Source 2). Likewise, Bogota, Colombia annually hosts a program known as the Day Without Cars that has attracted interest from neighboring countries and cities and provides an opportunity to ""take away stress and lower air pollution,"" according to businessman Carlos Arturo, who spent the day bicycling with his wife (source 3). Globally, limiting car usage has resulted in exciting changes for not only the environment, but, surprisingly, public health as well.

The obesity crisis and lack of healthy social interactions, secondly, both are looming global issues due the rise of supersized fast food and innovations in social media and the Internet, and this trend of limited car usage serves as an unseen, advantageous remedy by promoting healthier people and communities. Without cars, people must find alternative forms of transportation, and in Bogota, for example, during the Day Without Cars, ""millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated...to work,"" and since this campaign began in the mid-1990s, it has seen ""the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" and has resulted in parks, sports centers, and broad sidewalks; considerably less traffic; and the emergence of ""new restaurants and upscale shopping districts,"" (Source 3). A mother of two in Vauban, Germany, Heidrun, Walter, claims that, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (Source 1). Alternative forms of transportation also allow for increased social interaction - walking with your neighbor on the way to work, your kids interacting while en route to school, or striking up a conversation with a stranger on a public bus or tram are all examples of making connections with others that do wonders for our mental and social health.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

So I think i'll help beta test this essay writing test that SCHOOL_NAME was ""randomly selected"" for, but this prompt given with these writing selections, doesn't make any sense unless you wish a dull and dry essay with just regurgitated facts from the writing selections. So, here goes something.

In the state of STATE_NAME students from 3rd grade and up are all familiar with the infamous TEST_NAME, it was what was required for so many years and what we've all gotten used to. Once I personally hit middle school, we had midterms and finals for only one year, the following year they were removed and we were given interm exams for every quater to determine how much we were absorbing in the classroom. We were graded on these fairly, (not very heavily; 3 grades at the max.)

Up until about 8th grade I had never heard of an EOC, it was first introduced to me in my U.S history class. We took a test that our teacher had formulated and we all studied for weeks. I figured this would become apart of my highschool life, and I wasn't wrong; 9th grade Geometry EOC, and a Biology EOC. It was dreadful, (since it was taken on a computer in a freezing computer lab,) but we all survived because thankfully it was only for those two classes. After those two weeks of testing for the entire school it was fun and games and preperation for the challenges that were to come in our next year of schooling; for me this would be my relaxing yet exciting sophmore year.

Sophmore year had been going just fine up until one day in my french class we were informed that this year starting as early as January we would be tested with an EOC FOR EVERY CLASS! Students were confused and a bit outraged at this new information. We asked hundreds of questions. ""What will they be on?"" ""Is the district making them?"" ""Are you serious!?"" Our teacher,(well informed on what had seemed to be everything,) knew of our fate to come; five months of overall testing occuring through our hallowed halls. We were baffled that classes like P.E, Art, Culinary, Fabrics and fibers and even Swimming would have end of course exams. What questions would they even ask on these? How long has the district been planning this? Then she told us, ""We don't know what will be on them, all we know is that this test is created by teachers sending in questions to the district. The district is literally making it up as they go.""

We asked many more questions full of confusion and rage. When she then realized they have only made one test so far, a spanish test with no level. This test would be taken by spanish speakers and spanish learners all the same. This wasn't fair! It wasn't even comprehendable! We would be taking the same test as the French AP students!

This narrative explanitory essay is about the over load of testing that will be put upon the students of LOCATION_NAME. This ""random selection"" even if it was completly random, is just one the many irritating aspects of a SCHOOL_NAME students life at school for the next couple months, but maybe even up until we graduate!

I hope someone is reading this, and I hope I helped with your writing exam.               ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F8B406E59DDD,"Cars,the thing that all teenagers want when they turn sixteen. Driving gives a sense of freedom, but it comes with a price. Diving automotives pollutes the air with greenhouse gases. Cities like Paris, Vauban, and Bogota have some serious problems with pollution. Thats why we should limit vehicle usage.

Vauban, Germany is doing it wrong, by living in a ""car-free"" envirorment. The citizens that live here forbidden to own a car, driveway, and a home garage. There is a glimpse of light to all of you that love driving or need to drive to work. In this city, if somebody wanted to own an automotive they would have to pay an additional 40,000 dollars and live at the edge of the city limit. Pollution might be serious but you should just limit the commute to work so citizens don't have to drive so much. Think about it, if you force people that have cars to live on the city limit, but they might work in the middle of the city. I don't see the solution in that.

Paris, France, the city of love, is also the leading city in Europe of smog. ""passenger cars cause 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe."" (Rosenthal 5).Paris is not so bad in book compare to Vauban. Paris has assigned certain days for the drivers to drive. On one day, even license plates will drive and the odds with drive the following day. There are precausions that they take if a odd driver drives on an even day. The drive will be fined 22 euros (that is 31 american dollars).There is nothing wrong with this plan exept if some one with an odd license plate has an emergency, and needs to take care of it posthaste.

Smog is not a good thing at all, and won't decrease until we do some thing about it. that a 'car-free"" day and bike to where ever you need to go. This our planet and we should take car of it.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
5D934B4BED8F,"In Source One the story talks about the advanges of redusing car usage in the German areas. It states that cars produse about 12% of greenhouse gas in Europe and about 50% in major car usage areas in the United States. Also, street parking is generally forbidden on the outskirts of Freiburg. Even though Vauban's street are completly ""car-free"", except the main thoroughfare. Car ownership is allowed, but there is only two places to park, in a large garage outside their development where a space costs $40,000, or in their own homes. Because of this, about 70% of families in Vauban don't own car(s). Along with 57% of people that sold their car so they could move to Vauban.

In Source Two, in Paris, everyone who drove a car was fined, in two days about 4000 peopole were fined? That isnt actually a alot for a whole city, which is great news. Paris uses diesel fuel instead of gasoline, and now Paris is blaming that on their air pollution. Paris usually has more smog than any other European capital.

In Source Three, Bogota, Colombia has the Day Without Cars, where only public buses and taxis are allowed to drive in the city, anyone driving a car will be fined $25. the Day Qithout Cras started in the mid-1990s, and since then 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built. Parks and sport areas have also been built, along with more restaurants and shops near streets that used to be heavy with traffic, but now leave room for people to stop and visit.

As the majority of people learned in grade school, greenhouse gases aren't such a great thing and are even destroying the planet. Stepping away from your car could decrease the amount of these deadly gases we put into our atmosphere. in the first article Rosenthal says ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmision in Europe, and up to 50 in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" If the output is really that high and we stop using cars as much imagine the impact it could have if this happened world wide. in the second article Duffer was talking about how Paris had to ban cars because the smog, an effect of greenhouse gases, was too thick. towards the end he said that a few days of the car ban reduced the amount enough to where they could lift the ban. the smog was said to rival China's, and you see that on the news constantly so if only a few days made it significantly better then why can't we try it out?

Promoting alternative transportation could help local economies rise, and lower stress levels. ""It's a good oportunity to take away stress and lower air polution"" sais a business man participating in Bogata's car-free day. Participants in these events claim that they relieve stress and most people can see why, it's very hard to avoid stressful situations when you're driving. Whether it's the guy who cut you off or a slow old lady there is always something that will grind your gears. the executive chairman of the Ford company said that ""in cities where vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable they would be able to create a network that would save time, conserve resources, lower emisions, and improve safety."" If there are other sources of transportation available, why not take advantage of them?

Lowering our usage of cars we could keep our planet in good condition by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases and promoting alternative forms of trasportation which has benifits within itself.

00E9AC98B45E,"The invention of the automobile was one of the most important inventions of all time. Everyone uses cars! They're everywhere! But what are the effects of car emissions? Are they even worth using if they cause negative effects on people and our environment? Many people are trying to cut back on driving, or even live without cars. Why are they doing this? Well, let me inform you about some of the advanrtages of limited car usage throughout the world.

In Vauban, Germany, there is a suburb where people have decided to ban cars all together. The neighborhood roads are completely car-free and even having a garage is usually not allowed. About 5500 people live in this suburb and 70% of these people do not own cars. For the other 30%, there is a parking garage that is located on the edge of the community that requires a $40,000 payment to use. This trend is growing immensely in Europe and there could quite possibly be several communites that would mirror Vauban and what it is all about. This effort to ban cars is based on the idea of reducing pollution as well as reducing stress, and many members of the community insist they live happier and less stressful lives since moving into Vauban.

Bogota, Columbia is the home to nearly 7 million people, and in Bogota there is an annual car-free day, with hopes to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. There is also hope that this idea will spread to other cities and to other countries around the world. For the people who decide not to participate in the annual car-free day, a fine of $25 would be handed out. This ""holiday"" if you will, could be revolutionary potentially and if implemented year round, could really put a dent in the ammount of pollution throughout the city. Even the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay revered the program, saying it is ""generating a revolutionary change"".

Officials in Paris, France put a partial driving ban on the city in an effort to reduce smog in the city. The ban worked like this, on Monday, drivers with even-numbered license plates would not be allowed on the road. The next day, it would be the drivers eith odd-numbered license plates that would have to leave their cars at home. Nearly 4000 people were fined due to the enforcement of this ban, for somewhere around $120,000 total. The strictness of the ban was due to the seriousness of the smog and the fact that it was intensifying. The dissapearance of the smog resulted in loosening of the ban and less negative feedback from drivers.

As you can see, these places have been limiting car usage and found at least some sort of benefit from doing so. Maybe if these restrictions or all together bans were implemented in more places, pollution in the world would be hindered.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D2E3A806B00D,"Whether if it's a law in a country, the source of pollution or the cause of deaths, the usage of cars have its disadvantages and have been limited. However, driving cars have its advantages when individuals limit the use of it.

Using cars to reach a destination causes pollution according to experts, who are  correct. According to paragraph 5, ""experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions tailpipies...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" Because of this there has been efforts in the past two decades to make cities safer and easier to breathe in. A city that faces these pollution problems is Paris, which made authorities to prohibit driving. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This is the right thing to do because after this law was implemented there was less congestion. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" Pollution also has more of an impact depending on the tempertaure and day. ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layers of air to trap car emissions."" Also there are cities where using cars are near impossible, because of the laws that the governmental officials had enforced. An example of a city with these laws is Vauban, Germany. ""Street Parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban's streets are completely 'car-free.'''

However, There are advantages when individuals drive less. Owners of the public transportation have taken action. They subilminally convinced drivers to reduce pollution and dangerous accidentals by offering free transportation. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday."" When this was taken into action, smog was cleared in cities. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" When individuals drive less they are exposed to new activities that they have never experienced when driving. People can experience activities in places such as in Bogota, Colombia. ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" The main goal for this was to advocate other transportation in order to reduce pollution. There are also other factors that can substitute the place of driving. A suggestion was made by Mimi Sheller, who is a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of the University's Policy center and Mobilities Research. She said that ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Also that ""the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangments, including the evolution of shared services for getting to work."" Bill Ford, who is the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company has also suggested factors for safety and transportation. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.'""

49D4BB623BE8,"Many people in todays society tend to travel by car, but there is advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can stop pollution, and puts people in general in a more active environment. So, there are many other ways of transportation.

In the article, 'Car-Free Cities' it talks a lot about the advantanges of not driving a car. For example, according to the passage ""Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occaional distant motor."" This being said, you can conclude that more people are being more active. Furthermore, the passage says ""Passenger cars are respondible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" This meaning that some places in the United states gases are half of the areas pollution.

There are many more advantages to limiting car usages, and if other people do it so will the world. For example, according to the passage ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangle square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life."" Moreover, in the passage it also says ""But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking."" Furthermore, ""In this new approach, store are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distance highway."" This meaning the world has a solution to solve the usage of cars. By making suburbs you will be walking distance away from your destination. This also saves so much money, if you were to drive you would have to waste gas. It is also more of a benefit for one who walks, rides their bike, or runs by giving them the benefit of exercise.

By limiting the usage of cars, bike trails, parks, and sports centers have been a big hit. For example, according to the passage, ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s."" Moreover, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicylce paths."" This being said, the need to make such a long bike path means that more people are joining in on the limiting usage of cars, which is a benefit for us humans, and the fresh air that we breathe. People are also becoming more active, for example according to the passage ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;"" Since the parks and sports centers have been blooming people are being more active. New side walks are being replaced so people can actually walk on them, the cut of traffic means less people are driving. In big cities, it just might be faster to get to your destination by riding a bike.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages to limiting car usage. It helps by lowering the percent of pollution, on top of that it also helps save money. By walking or riding your bike to your destination can benefit you in many ways. It also helps by making the world a better place. People seem to be happier when they see other being active, so the next time one thinks to drive a walking distance, rethink your decision.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D3D2660F2D77,"Using a motor vehicle as a source of transportation is part of everyday life and is not rare to the stereotypical American. But cities such as Paris, Bogota, and Vauban are all striving towards reducing the rate of motor vehicle usage in their areas. Advantages of limiting car usage are lower greenhouse gas rates, suburbs can become more compact and more accesible to public transportation, and people are able to live less stressful lives.

Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisions and is responsible for fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States but is slowly making a change towards helping the enviornment and being beneficial towards carbon emissions. In 2005, the number of miles driven in the United States was at it's highest rate. As time went by, the numbers started dropping and getting lower. Many sociologits believe that if the numbers get even lower and stay at that rate, the benefits will come for the enviornment but unfortunetly not for car companys. Paris typically has more smog than any other European capital and is working towards a way to fix that. Paris banned driving due to the intensity and abundance of the smog in their city and had people use public transportation free of charge for about a week. Not using motor vehicles for those days really did help the situation of Paris and gave people an insight as to how life would be without cars.

Vauban, an upscale community in Germany, is home to suburban pioneers who have given up their cars. Seventy percent of Vauban's family do not own cars and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move there. ""Smart planning"" is a component of the movement to seperate suburban life from auto use to create a denser and more compact enviornment and let people be more accesssible to public transportation. This means less space for parking, and more stores compactly placed and at short distances. In Bogota, ""Car-free day"" is part of an improvement campaign which helps residents of the city to see how life is life without the use of cars for a day. People use public transportation and walk to their destinations with no problem. More parks and sport centers have also been added to the area as a result of less car usage, so more space for other important things.

Dropping off your kid at daycare, then driving to work, then having to drive your child to soccer practice can be a constant and stressful cycle for most parents. Residents of suburbs that have low car usage rates claim that they are less stressful. In a suburban community with little to no motor vehicle usage, the suburb will be more compact, having more stores and buildings closer to eachother at very short distances. This makes it easier for residents to get from point A to point B quicker and more efficiently. This also allows for more walking areas with less traffic and dangerous cars to worry about.

the passage ''In German Suburb, life goes on Without Cars'' In Vauban, Germany residents have given up their cars. a souce says ''when i had a car i was always tense, im much happier this way.'' One of the advantages of not owning a car in this community was the feeling of a more compact and accessiable way to public transportation. By not having cars if you were to walk down the street instead of hearing car motars distantly running, sources say they hear the sound of bikes and adults and even childrens chatter filling their ears. With not having cars it can make it so much easier to get social and connect with others in your area instead of being a hermit you can meet new people, make friends and even create plans which is a major benifit.

In ''Paris bands driving due to smog,'' Paris,Frace also had the same idea to get rid of cars to clear the air of their global city. This can help with allergies and getting sick which als can cause some to become less social towards others. This largely well know city's expectations where correct. Congestion went down 60% clearing the air for a better enviroment for residents. With the city having a lower air pollution and smog reduced, a benifit of not having a car is free public trasportation Monday-Friday. This saves tons of money that you could have used to pay for gas,car insurance,and any costly repairs or damage you might need to fund for.

The city Bogota, located in Columbia as well limited the usage of cars .In ''Car free Day is Spinning into a big hit in Bogota,'' Instead people biked,hiked,skated which makes you become more active,and residents took public buses as well; promoting alternitive transportation. This of course helped to reduce the smog and lowered the air pollution. Not having to worry about a car is also a benefit in which it reduces stress .Limiting car usage also cuts traffic making it quicker to get to your designated location safer which is more benificial.

The end of car culture also benifits implications for carbon emissions, again helping our living space. People feel more connceted with out driving to meet up with a group of friends because of the internet. saving time for the long boring drive,concerving resources, lowering emissions and improving safety are all so important to us now and later down the road if we limit our usage of cars.

Which also leads to 57% percent of them sold a car to move into the local area. Most of the women and children use bicycle to travel around the area to get to place to place. The sitiuation got so bad that 12% percent of the passengers cars were responsible for greenhouse gas emission in Europe. And 50% percent of some car intensive areas in the united states. Many people tried to make an effort for the past two decades to make the cities denser.

Developments have started to change since world war II , David goldbreg made efforts for the transportation for america amd fast growing coalition of hundreds of groups. In New york suburbs with out spread out homes and private garages were the dreams town of the 1950's and still exert a strong appeals. Why did paris ban driving ? after days of the pollution recorded nears to high rates to a danger zone. The pollution causes motorists to leave their automobile at home or get fined 22 euro ($31),many reports were saying almost 4,000 drivers have been fine because they chose to drive their cars. The smog congestion was down to 60% percent because beijing,china was one of the biggest cities with most polluted cities in the world.

Diesel fuel was one of the worst ways to travel around with ,because it causes alot more pollution,diesel makes up to 67% percent of vehicles in france compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western europe according to reuters. The smog created a car free day , the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital ofcity of seven million. Many violaters faced a $25 fines, municipal authorities from others countries came to bogota , improvements campaign in the mid 1990's. The smog also created a 118 mile paths for most latin american city according to Mockus,the city mayor. Some sidewalks have been replaced by broad .\, smooth sidewalks, rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.

President Obama ambitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse gas emissions unveiled. America adjusted the population growth, the number of driven miles in the united states peaked in 2005 anmnd dropped steadily. By the many measures the decrease preceded the downturn and appear to be persisting now that will be recovered under way. Over the years driving has been decreasing because of the polluted areas in other countries. But many citizens refused to ride bike or take buses for transportation. So the causes has everyone to end of the car culture.          ",1,Car-free cities,Text dependent
DF0DE9A65987,"As time progresses, more and more young people aren't buying personal cars but instead use public transport or walk to where they need to go. Other than the youth, suburbs have found this as a great way to destress as some cities, like Bogota, Columbia, have dedicated a day to stop the use of personal cars for one day. This decline of using our own cars has a positive effect on our air and the way our youth has begun to travel.

People around the world are starting to make this transition from using their personal cars to using public transport or carpooling with friends. The youth today try to mange their schedules so they can find ways to use more and more of public transit. ""There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 and 39 year-olds getting a license..."" (Rosenthal 38), meaning that most of the youth these days are finding it easier and, though a little more time consuming, less worrisome than buying or driving a personal car. It seems getting a license isn't taking top priority for the youth. ""In a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between  2001 and 2009..."" (Rosenthal 41).Whether the youth is going to start buying cars when they have children or not, it seems the general decline of buying automobiles for yourself isn't a boom like it used to be.

Experiments being hosted all over the world in small areas also show that using no cars is decreasing pollution and allowing us cleaner air overall. In Bogota, Columbia, a program that bans all cars for one day, and despite terrible weather for the third year, and it seems that people are loving it. And despite the threatening rain, the turn out was huge (Selsky 22).  ""...experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes...""(Rosenthal 5). Our personal cars ""are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States where areas are heavily populated with car owners""(Rosenthal 5). Numbers like this would decline over time if we start using less and less cars. Maybe then we'd actually have fresh air to breath rather than the polluted air we breath now. Even in Paris, where they have ""enough smog to compete with Beijing""(Duffer 14) they banned cars for a while. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paries enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Duffer 10). As they enforced the ban, smog started to clear up around the city, meaning that no cars can really help clear up the air we breath in daily.

As the air begins to clear up and our youth taking a stand against owning their own cars, it seems like this could be a steady decline of personal cars and more will start using public transport. It seems time is progressing to an age where young people don't feel the haste of using personal cars and instead resort to public transport.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
852A7F32C8A5,"Its no secret that driving automobiles has alot to do with how much pollution is pumped into the air. The biggest issue with driving a car in crowded areas is the smog build up. Many countrys have taken an interest in limiting cars temporarly to decrease smog, or dedicating individual communitys to a car free area with the exception of buses and taxis.

High pollution levels is a rising epedemic that needs to be stoppped before it is out of hand or un-reversable. Many country's plan to action is limiting car usage for a certain amount of time untill the smoge is under control. It states in source two paragraph ten that ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Within the five days that this rule was enforced the smog in the city had decreased by 60 percent.

Many people tend to rely on cars in their everday life. What people need to realize is that there are other forms of transportation that is just as easy and far less toxic to the planet and to ourselfs. In source 1 paragraph 3 a woman states "" when i had a car i was always tense, im much happier this way."" It is clear that the use and want for owning and using your own car has went down emensly since 1995. People call it a cultural shift excpecially in America where cars are so heavily manufactured and bragged about.

In conclusion, cars are a huge reason why the world is so polluted. This wouldnt be such an issue if so many people didnt use cars in their everday life. Once poeple realize that they can still be perfectly content without having to drive everywhere is when this planet will make a big turn around in the way we try to protect the planet.

00944C693682,"Limiting the usage of cars has personal and professional support all across the globe and yet it has yet to be embraced everywhere. Statistical proof show where it may help and real life examples of some of the effects of reducing, or getting rid of altogether, cars in one's daily life. While ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (Source 4), is that really enough or for the right reason? There are plenty of reasons to stop, or limit, the amount of cars being driven on the roads for every kind of person, from the hippie to the businessman, from the mom to the college student. With so many things in this world that few people agree on, this is a nice change to see in regards the removal of so many cars. Why would they all agree, one might ask. Well, there are plenty of reasons.

For starters, stress. It is no secret that morning traffic jams and 5'o'clock traffic is often enough to send any driver into a fit of unadulterated rage and what better way is there to prevent that than to simply not drive at all? Mother and media trainer, Heidrum Walter attested to this after moving into a mostly car-less community, claiming ""when [she] had a car [she] was always tense. [She's] much happier [that] way"" (Source 1). If that were not enough, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza who participated in the Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia, after just a day was able to say ""it's a good oppurtunity to take away stress"" (Source 3). Just one day was enough to de-stress this man and if that does not speak wonders, one has to wonder what does. The event ""[left] the streets of [Bogota] eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Source 3), which goes to show how stressful it was everyday, with traffic jams a common occurance. No one enjoys them, so why continue to suffer through them?

Additionally, the environment suffers greatly from the many car emissions let out on the roads. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Source 1). This alone should be enough to horrify anyone out of such copious amounts of car usage. If that were not enough, ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"" (Source 4). It is clear that cars are only doing more harm to this earth all humans live on and happen to only have one of, so there is no need to continue on knowing this without changing something about that. Even car-pooling could significantly reduce emissions as there would be less cars out there, which is possible through ""more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" (Source 4).

Of course, adding the last two reasons together makes for another very important factor in all of this: everyone's general health. Both stress and high concentrations of smog can do a toll on one's body and the reduction of cars, once again, helps to reduce this terrible down-sides to the easy transportation option. If it must be described as ""emissions ... are choking cities"" (Source 1), then why not be a bit more concerned. Air pollution can affect those with pre-existing respitory issues and stress can be a deciding factor in how effient and well a person can function. Stress on the road can lead to unsafe driving and a worse performance at work, school, or any other task-oriented location that many go to with the aid of a car.

It is also worth noting that cities that have embraced a no car lifestyle such as Vauban or Bogota have generally improved as a community and have given back anything the newly car-less citizens may have been missing out on through saving them time and money. In Vauban, ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" (Source 1). This is not only much more cost-efficient, but also convienent. This is saving both time and money, just like in Bogota where ""parks and sports centers [] have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Source 3). Not only does this help individual citizens and business owners, it helps the overall economy of the city as well.

Individual car use isn't bad. Millions of individuals using cars, however, is very bad. Note the emphasis. Even just making a concious effort to car pool, bike to work or school, use public transportation, or use some sort of alternative transportation could be enough to clear up the air of some of it's emissions, keep oneself and others happier and less stressed, save time and money, and improve their city all in one little decision. It's just a matter of going ahead and doing it, so what is stopping anyone from going out and making that change now? Be the change you want to see and limit your car usage now.

hese two articles both shows reasons why we should limit car usage. I know people are going to be like, "" How am i going to get to work?"", "" How am i going to do this and that with out my car?"", but if you sit down and really think about it there are some very good reasons why us fellow citizens should limit our car usage.

On paragraph 3 source 1: In German Suburb Life Goes Without Cars, it says "" when i had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way, a media trainer and mother of two as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and he chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor"" in this quote it talks about how a mom is going green and starts walking and bicycling instead of driving every day. If you drive everyday you lose alot of money thru out the year spending on gas, car repairs etc. and you pullute the air, now a days the air that we breath is getting worse and worse by the years passed but we could fix it if we limit our car usage. With going green and limited driving you could start walking and get good excersise, our world to day not doing so good and one main reason is because of pullution and obesity. You could knock both of those out by just simply walking to the store instead od drving and losing gas. Cars are graeat dont get me wrong, they have been the a big impact om our world but it changed over the years as people started buying cars and gas prices and oil prices are going up, we should all just go green for a while.

It will help if you just stop drving one time a week, that will make a impact to our society. I dont think people shouold be fined for driving a car that they payed for and that is theirs, if you could talk well and a good persuader you could change the mind of the citizens. Hopefully the world changes and goes green a little more eery thing helps.      ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
24C584D3D271,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing the usage of cars we can lower the air pollution in our cities. If the number of cars on the road is lower than usual, then the number of traffic jams and car crashes will be decreased. Driving is a huge responsibility and worrying about protecting your life, the passengers in your cars life, and other drivers on the road's life can be very stressful at times.  Lowering the usage of cars can limit that stress.

Polloution is bad and it destroys the Earth. When we drive, our tailpipes give off greenhouse emmissions that ravage the o-zone layer of our atmoshphere. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. The congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. By reducing our car usage, we can make our world a more clean and less polluted place.

Traffic jams are annoying and frustrating. Car crashes are dangers and life altering. You can avoide both of these terrible things by limiting how often you drive your car. Everytime you sit down in that drivers seat and turn the car on, there is a chance of getting stuck in traffic or into a wreck. There is no better way to avoid this than walking, taking a bus, or biking where ever you need to go. In a program that was set to spread to other countries, millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses yesterday, leaving the streets of Bogota, Colombia free of traffic jams.

Driving can put a tremendous amount of stress on a person. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. You don't have to live with all of that stress. Just limit yout car usage and you will live a happier life.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages to limiting car usage. You can lower air pollution. Driving less reduces the chances of you getting in a traffic jam or worse, a car accident. Last but most certainly not least, driving less reduces stress.                     ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
6D417F773D10,"In Columbia, Germany, and Paris they are trying to limit the usage of cars in many ways so that they can improve the air and promote alternate transportation.

By reducing car usage like they did in paris where they made people with even numbered license plates leave there cars at home then the next day did the same thing to people with odd numbered licence plates. People who dident follow this rule were fined twenty-two euro's or thirty-one dollars. About 4,000 people did not folow the rule and got fined and about 27 of them got detained due to the reaction they gave when recieving the fine. By implementing this in Paris it brought down congresion by sixty percent after five days. This is a reason why car usage should be limited.

Germany is trying to. In a city called Vauban, cars are banned. You can own a car which you can park in one of two garages the town has on the outskirts but it cost 40,000 dollars so people tend to sell there car. In the town stores are built down the main road in walking distance due to the fact that there are no cars. This town is an experimental new district, on the outskirts of freiburg, close to the french and swiss borders. The town is totaly ""Car-Free"" if you dont count the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown freiburg runs. If this town spreads around the world and othere towns and cities implement the same idea we could lower pollution and better the enviorment. If we build everything closer there will be o nead for cars so thats another reason why we should limit car usage.

In columbia they implemented a car-free day where every one took buses, road bikes and other neat things to get from place to place. This program is wanted to spread to other countries. In the third straight year of implementing this idea they banned all cars on that day except buses and taxis. The goal is to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. Violaters faced a twenty-five dollar fine. Aside from the occasinal rain storms, this idea is a good way to ""take away stress and lower air pollution."" said ny businessman Carlos Arturo plaze as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. For the first time two othere columbian cities join the event. The cites are Cali and Valledupa. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictios have dramatically ut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" This is all in result of that event. Quoted from sorce 3.

As you can see there are many was to reduce air pollution and promote alternate transporation. By taking away cars alternate transportation is needed to fulfil that tasks that need to be done throghout the day and without the exaust of so many cars going off the air pollution will go down too.

64C858F302EF,"Numerous amount of people would love to experince the opportunities of limiting their time with their car. There are a great amount of advantages of limiting car usage. Advantages include having a more healthy environment, decreasing stress, and reducing traffic.

The advantages of limiting car usage is helping the environment. ""Passanger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" While most of the adult population is driving cars everyday, more gas and smoke go into the air and into our environment. This causes pollution and hurts our environment. Paris has a major smog problem in their environment, up to the point where it was near-recorded. Paris had to then enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. The effect of this ban was that congestion was down 60 percent and the smog cleared after a short week.  If we were able to limit our car usage, then our greenhouse gas emissions would decrease. ""In the United States, the environmental protection agency is promoting car reduced communities, and legislators are starting to act."" There are numerous environmental agencies that are already starting to act to decrease the car usage in the country. We should limit our car usage because it can greatly help our environment.

If were able to limit our car usage, then it will greatly decrease our stress of driving. Many countries are trying to reduce car usage. An example is Columbia. Columbia has created a car-free day. ""Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses during car-free day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Bogota, Colombia have practiced this day for three years and many colombians have been pleased with it. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Plaza. Without driving, you have the time to go out, be active and get exercise. A huge effect of the car free day is that park and sport centers have been built all throughout Bogota, smoother sidewalks, and rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. With car usage reduced, it limit people's stress on driving.

If we were able to lower the number of car usage, then our streets would be much safer and there would be less traffic. Many people use cars today and because of that most of streets are usually blocked up. If there were less cars on the streets then it would be easier and quicker to go to places. Vanban, Germany is an example of an car-free town. ""...basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls alond some distant highway."" With less cars on the streets, it can also reduce car accidents and deaths. If there were less cars on the roads, there would be less traffic and car accidents.

693C3112ED21,"Since the invention of the first automobiles, negative impacts such as greenhouse gases, and other enviromental effects have plauged the world in a very short amount of time. Some people are taking action, like in certain cities such as Vauban Germany, paris and Colombia, by taking efforts to reduce the use of cars for transportation. Ultimatly, as people begin the shift from autombile transport; certain economic, enviromental, and societal advantages will benifit the world we live in today.

In Vauban germany, residents of the town are starting to take efforts in the first of ""car-free"" societies. To most people this idea could seem unpractical, but car free living can be very benefitial, to the enviroment and daily life. For instance, people in Vauban claim that they feel very tense when they own, and have to drive a car to and from places that they have to work. The layout of these cities like vauban, are unique because they are very dense, unlike the urban and suburban towns of america. This makes walking and biking a more easy method of transportation without having the negative effects of green house gases. In Bogota Colombia, residents are also realizing the the benefits that come with no cars, in wich they have a car- free day that spawns a whole new way of life. The new methods of transportation then become centered around bikes, walking, and other methods of non poluting trasnportation. This also leads to a benefit on the economy, by having 118 miles of bicycle paths built, new walking paths, resturaunts, and shopping districts being created.

In Paris, near-records pollution caused by smog, forced city leaders to take action, banning all cars in a 2 day period; and fining all violators of this new ban. This limited congestion in the capital by 60%. Free public transit was also issued for the exception of the ban, even though almost 4000 drivers were fined and some had their cars impound; which certainly helped the number of pollutants on the streets. The smog cleared enough on monday, to where all odd numbered plates were free of the ban on tuesday. These notacable enviromental effects were so substantial in such a short amount of time, that it could spawn a whole new wave of car banning cities to help thier local enviroment. If every city was based around this ideal, it would help their local enviroment, ultimatly helping their economic industries. Globally, this would make a huge change in the world wide market and decrease greenhouse gases.

The United States is also seeing a change in the amount of people that are buying fewer cars and driving less. These kinds of trends will ultimatly benefit the society if continued, by limiting carbon emissions. Although this would hurt the car industry, it would help other parts of the economy like agriculture and ocean based fishing, by helping these ecosystems to produce more effectivly. Places like New York also have bike-sharing programs, which would have a impact on people's health too. Most people do not realize the postitive effects that daily exercise can have upon yourself. For example; if every person in New york walked to where they work every morning; new york would experiance a wave of healthy, happy, individuals. Even large car companies like ford are stating that pedestrain, bicycle, and public trasprotation save time, lower emissions and improve safety.

Overall, benifits of reducing car transportation is too great to be ignored. It is a step in the right direction that people are taking action and rising up for the greater good of their local towns and spreading awareness by these actions. Our future could go either way, we can continue on this path and do whats right for the enviroment, or neglect the earth we live on and face the consequences.                                    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D8D0B46D3265,"Walking, jogging, or even riding a bike. All ways of transportation, right? And also, the car. Of course that'd be the intial thing most people would want rather than actually exercising to get from one point to another. However, limiting car usage would be better for our planet and for us.

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , it has a bystander that says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. She is a mother of two, and she has walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. So, not only is she a mother of two and basically walks everywhere, driving made her tense. And she claims to actually be happier walking rather than using a car to transport her to different areas. Another thing from this article includes this line, ""...Ad that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes.... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.. and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" So, if we were to not necessarily drive too often, we'd be doing the Earth a favor in making the world more dense.

Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog , already off the bat. Driving in Paris is basically banned, because of smog. It states, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" All the gases that are in the air due to cars and such could very well just harm us, and Earth. However, it is a good thing that Paris had banned that, because people who've tried to keep driving, has had to suffer a 22-euro fine. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. Other people care about our world enough to get them to stop what they're doing. Or, at least ban it for a while. But, typically, Paris has more smog than other European capitals. It says, ""[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of the particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" Now, not trying to argue with this, however, not driving for a while is something that'd be better for not just Europe, but everywhere around the world. It's a big deal, and our ozone layer could basically kill us in the end.

Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota , now, by this article, it pretty much states that trying to promoted alternative transportation and reducing smog had violaters face $25 fines. It was the third year straight they've tried to do this, but people still got caught doing it. But, it does mention, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo. He does have a point here, because it helps us in the end. Another thing it adds is, ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that begain in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the contrustion of 118 miles of bicyle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor."" So basicallt not driving is a relatively great thing for us, now, not driving for a while is not any intention, but limiting it is probably what's best.

And last but not least,

The End of Car Culture , it claims that fewer people over the years have not been getting licenses and buying cars. Which, is a good sign for us. As a world all together, we shouldn't be depending on transportation (by car, of course), to get anywhere. It's much better this way for us to do this because it's mainly how we're effecting the Earth that's the problem, well.. and obesity but it's not a huge concern. But, that's just the way it is. It goes on to say that people 19-21 and older in some cases haven't even wanted a car or even attempt to get their license. And that says something. We're changing, and that's a great thing. Of course, we still will use cars, but hopefully not as much as we used to basically.

To conclude this, other transportation other than driving, would be better for the world, and we could use something else to make it better for us. Of course we'd still use cars, but not using it as much would definitely be our goal in today's world.                              ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

""What are some advantages of limiting car usage?"" You want to know some advantages right? Well there are some advanages like losing stress,relaxing,and helping the envoriment. Bet you didnt know that! but im going to explain to you why know because your probely curious why?

Want to know an of advantage of limiting car usage? Well heres one, as said in source number 3 paragraph 24 ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with hus wife."" It says that when not usuing a car you can loose stress just by riding a bike because its less traffic and stuff. So when you dont use a car you can loose stress.

But thats not just the only advantage, theres more! another advantage is that it can make you relax as well because then you would be able to spend more ""family"" time and some ""you"" time because you wont have to worry about  going to places if you cant use your car. Ands thats relaxing because theres nothing better to then to be with your family having fun relaxing.

But that not it! the most advange to this topic is that your helping the envoriment! why you may ask? well like as said in source 3 paragraph 24 "" Its a good opportunity to take away lower air pollution"" thats some evidence i found because has  Carlos Arturo Plaza was riding his bike thats what he said. So he said bascilly that when you use a car your polluting the environment but when you done use a car then not polluting th environment is a advange. So therefore helping your environment is a advange to this topic, and the most important one!

So you wanted to know some advangaes tolimiting car usage? Well you got your answer. i had give 3 reasons to you have some advanages for limiting car usage. As loosing stress,relaxing,and helping the enviroment, these are some great atvanges but theres many more. I just didnt want to list more because i though i would bored you to death!

But it can also be pretty nerve wrecking knowing you have to walk everywhere you want to go. But the more walking you do, the less money your spending. Having no worries about paying for gas, car notes, tickets, etc.

Another good thing about not having a car is staying in shape. Walking around to get to where you need to go would get you more than plenty excerise. Nothing like having a nice healthy body, burning calories, and even pounds. Having nice strong and healthy heart and burning off the fat that you put on by doing nothing and being physically active by walking.

Less accidents, car jams, traffic problems, and even car polution. What parent doesn't want a cleaner air for there children to breathe? Less cars can somehow lead to an safer enviornment. Less car accidents dealing with people texting and driving, which could lead to less possiblities of death maybe.

No one wants to walk everywhere their trying to go, nothing wrong with going for a nice bike ride there. Limiting car usage can maybe differ the world, cause less problems, less worries, and the best of all. . . SAVE MORE MONEY!    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

The benefits of limiting car usage are it will help the environment, it will reduce most citzens stress levels, and it will regulate money in different way.

The benefits of limiting car usage is that the evvironment will be a lot healthier. According to experts ""[Automobiles are] a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes,""(Source #1). The environment is very important to keep healthy. Cars are very polutefull ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,"" (Source #2) towards the environment.

86A39056FB93,"Giving up a car can be difficult. But if you all knew more about cars, perhaps you all would stop using them. Or at least limiting the usage of your car. Lowering the pollution rate in the world would defenetlly be an advantage. There would br more space for other things to be built. And besides, cars are a one of the many ways people die.

Cars are so mediocre for our environment. . ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" The percentage is lower in Europe due to the fact that Europeans drive less that the people in United States do. The Environmental Protection Agency are promoting ""car reduced"" communities in the United States. Beijing, China, is on eof the most polluted cities in the entire world. Many countries and cities are enforcing a partial driving ban to get rid of the air pollution. Places like France, Paris, London and even Bogota, Colombia. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlose Arturo, a businessman. Studies in  America show that as each year goes by, less and less Americansare buying or driving cars. Studies also show fewer licenses are getting distributed each year.

Driving fewer cars means that roads really aren't useful anymore. So, that leaves room for other things to be built. Things like parks, restaurants, shopping centers, and it woould be great for promoting or expanding companies. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hourrestrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

Finally, cars are one of the many ways people die. Statistics show that car crashes are more likely to happen than getting in a plane crash or any other type of collision. Especially for teens who have just got their license. Many peopole die from car crashes, just think about all the losses we could prevent from happening. Just because that person didn't mean anything to you doesn't mean they weren't loved by someone else.

In conclusion, you should see the many things we could avoid with cars. The many advantages we would have without cars. We would have less pollution, more space for other things to be built, and the lives of your loved ones. Even if you choose not to stop driving your car, at least limit the usage of it, or you coud car-pool.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

But, cars arent that great they are actually causeing alot of damage. the pollution that is given off by cars is ridculous. most people dont relize the damage they are doing let alone the affect cars have on your life.

Frist off, cars are responible for 12 percent of greenhouse house emissions in europe. In some car-intensive areas in the  United states the greenhouse emissions are about 50 percent from cars! thats alot people are causeing without really knowing if we were to get the word out maybe we could change it and make the world cleaner.

Secondly, the united states environmental agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. they want to make cities and towns more compact and close together. Because in the suburbs cars play such a huge role. these places arent very compact, so people cant just walk everywhere that would take all day. but on the upside walking everywhere is good excerise so while your getting rid of pollution, your also lossing the obesity rate in the united states.

then, in Paris they have banned cars due to smog. Anyone who drove would be fined 22 euros (31 dollars). congestion in the captial france was down almost 60 percent. after a little bit of time enough smog had cleared so they could rescind the ban.

after, in Bogota, Colombia they started a car free  day were everyone took buses, biked, hiked, walked or any means of transportaion except cars to get to work. this reduces smog in that area. all of this walking and so forth also helps people relive stress.  which wil drop the crime rates.

Lastly, in the untied states gas emissions are quite high. but, are believed to go down beacuase in  a recent study , fewer people each year are buying cars or getting liscence. they say if this pattern contuines and they think it will cars will stop coming around.

Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecissary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehical. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage,

Paris bans driving due to smog , the author states,"" Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters."" Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don't have to spend with car trouble, someone could by a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.

Less car usage could also help the envirnment dramtically. Because of the ussage of cars the envinment has been hugely effected. Since the envirnment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage,

Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,""Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while excepltions were made for plug-in cars."" Not only is pollution affecting the envirnment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increse rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess envinments to worry about.

Besides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. A main point of less car usage would be for health. The world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the envirnment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the envirnment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and grrenhouse gas in the world.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe envirnment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe envirnment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.     ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

I think that if people walked instead of cars they would be happier and healthier.

if people didnt use cars as thier way of tranportation then there would be less pollution in the air that can make people sick, and there would be dangerous gases that cars emit. If americans cut down on driving then every place that cut down would be a better living environment, and every body would be happier because they dont have to worry about drunk drivers or people cutting them off on the intersection, and people all most causing wrecks becuase people would be walkin, jogging, and riding bikes, or anyother way of transport.

overall if everybody started walking or jogging, and riding bikes instead of driving then it would help the air we breathe, it would cut down on car accidents, it would help with people who are overwieght and need excercise, cutting down on driving could help with alot of global problems happening in the world today.

They have done this because there tail pipe emmisions,the smoke is unhealthy to breathe,and most people cant afford a car.

The emmisions from the tail pipe that comes out of the car is cause in most passengers car is the cause for the 12% of the greenhouse gases in Europe and 50% in the U.S.A.most cities have been trying to cut back on the car use or public transportation many will still ride a bus or drive to avoid walking or bycicling.

C11691BE646E,"In America, cars have been an integral part of our culture; from the Model T. Ford to the Mustang cars have cemented themselves into our mindset. But currrently cars are starting to cause a lot of problems to people such as: car accidents, pollution, and just leaving areas to crowdy. One of the main problems that cars globally cause is smog emission which is caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and can cause difficulty in breathing, lung cancer and rampant air pollution. However, in other parts of the world people are limiting car usage to almost banning them all out completly in certain areas in order to be more environmentally freindly and reducing air pollution. By limiting car usage in America people can benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.

In North America, pollution has been a major problem for citizens in many ways. Besides power plants, the second main source of pollution are cars, as they release harmful chemicals and gases like smog which can cause congestion and when too much and inhaled on a daily basis, can lead to lung cancer. By limiting car usage people can benefit more to the people; for example in Paris,France a partial driving ban was enforced in order to clear the air of smog after days of near-record pollution. By doing this congestion was brought down by 60 percent helping to majorly clear the air and make breathing better for people.

In Vauban, Germany residents of the area have been called suburban pioneers due to gibving up their cars. By doing this people were able to be more happy and enjoy life more. For example, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" this aids the argument that by banning or limiting car usage people are able to be much calmer and benefit more. In Bogota, Colombia during ""Car-free day"" for the first time two colombian cities joined Bogota in this unique event. there more parks and sports centers for people were placed, the sidewalk were smoothe and more business and commercial areas were opened up for people. This further shows that pweople can benfit greatly without having cars.

Throughout the world wherever cars have been limited or banned there has always been one constant, new alternative transportation. In China in order to help reduce the absurd amount of smog and air pollution, chinese citizens resorted to using bikes leading to a drop in smog levels. By limiting cars and replacing them with alternative transportation people can be much safer from more dangerous situations, such as car acsidents hurting people, keeping dunk drivers away from the steering wheel, and being able to save more money from not buying a car. Though some alternate vehicles are not fast enoguh for example bikes, this has been remedied in some areas by allowing free public transit from buses and taxi services.

Throughout all of these benfits people can benfit more greatly but that's not enough. In 2012 during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford proposed a business plan in where partnering with the telecommunication industry to create cities where ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation trafic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""-""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Through bright ideas like the advantages of limiting cars can be fully realized and brought to life in order to help and save more people from negative aftereffects. In America if people were to cut down on car use people could benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.

F8BD33BC0C9B,"Humankind has always been fascinated with the concept of cars. Motorized vehicles that effortlessly take you from one area to another when compared to more traditional methods such as walking. Everyone wanted a car for themselves to become a part of the innovation. But as time has passed, we now realized that it was naive of us to think cars were going to revolutionize transport, as some of the more simpler ways of transport (bike riding, bus) outshined car ownership in practicality and efficiency.

Now more than ever, alternative transportation methods are being promoted heavily in order to reduce the amount of pollution in the atmosphere. A shining example of this is in Paris, France (""Paris bans driving due to smog"", source two), where the goverment took the initiative to limit the usage of vehicles to reduce the amount of smog in the city.

Paris, one of the most idolized cities in the world, was at a point where the density of smog and pollutants in the air rivaled Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. However, after the driving ban in Paris, the city saw a drastic reduction in the amount of pollutants in the air, as it dropped down from 147 micrograms of particulate matter/cubic meter. Not only that, but Paris also saw an inprovement in car traffic, dropping down to 40 percent of what it originally was five days after the ban.

With all this in mind, how does this benefit the population without looking at the pollution reduction? This can also benefit us physically and psychologically. In Bogota, Colombia, a generally congested city, filled with traffic jams and other problems; Mayor Antanas Mockus promoted alternative transportation in the ""Day Without Cars event""(Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, source 3). In an effort to encourage public transportation in the city of 7 million inhabitants, Mockus promoted an event in which the only form of motorized transportation available was taxi cabs and bus rides. This mean that the people took the opportunity to bike, walk, hike from one point to another. Subsequently, this also indirectly promoted physical fitness and a stress release for people wanting to take the chance to enjoy their day. As Carlos Plaza evidently states that it is a great way to take away stress, while on a bike ride with his wife. Colombia has also opened up new bike path, parks, and sports centers, which is all the more proof that this initiative is promoting physical fitness and psychological wellness.

One could argue that this revolution of alternative transportation could have negative consequences on car industries and other businesses that rely on personal vehicle, and they wouldn't be wrong. But this phenomenon doesn't necessarily have to hurt anyone, as these same industries can promote their time and resources on projects that also promote alternative transportation. Just as well, in recent years, the amount of people getting driver's licenses and relying on personal vehicles has seen a significant decline, such as the amount of young prople driving decreaed 23 percent from 2001 to 2009, or when a study showed the amount of miles driven by the average American peaked in 2005 and steadily declined since then (The End of Car Culture, Source 4). People started to see the efficiency of alternative transportation, and capitalized on the opportunity to make transportation more accessible to everyone. Whether its from the expanding biclycle paths in New York City, to the Bay Area Rapid Transport in San Francisco, these are just a few examples of the steadily growing list of cities promoting more accessible transportation.

So with all of this in mind, there is irrefutable evidence that the more simpler methods of alternative transportation to limit vehicular usage is more efficient and practical. As seen in Paris where the city saw a significant drop in the amount of smog the city contained. Or when Bogota where an event that banned vehicular usage promoted physical and psychological wellness. People opting for alternative transportation is the global phenomenon that benefits us in more ways than we can imagine. There''s no doubt that the older, more traditional methods of transportation out perform personal vehicles in efficiency.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Although cars may offer easy access and convenience, they can affect the enviroment with the releasing of carbon gas emissions and smog, trapping in gas.

Limiting car usage can benefit the enviroment and life of residents by ensuring them a safe area of living. If we can limit car usage it will greatly benefit us in different ways.

To get more in depth, Vauban is an experimental upscale community where streets attempt to be car free. This city is an example of what car limitation can be capable of. Cars have gases and carbon emission that are released when put in use. This can harm our atmosphere by trapping in greenhouse emssions. Statistics from experts demonstate that in Europe passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and up to an unbelievable 50 percent in the United States alone. The efforts of car limitation can be an advantage into stopping these gases from growing in the near future.

Paris, France is a smog filled European city due to the large congestion and diesel engines. On a Monday motorists with even-numbered plates had to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 dollar fine. Due to the restriction, congestion over the following five days was down 60 percent. Also opening up, wasthe free charge of the public transit. The restriction of cars opened up great advantages to decline the number of congestion which lowered the percentage of carbon emissions. If the population can take the limitations one period at a time the communities can experience cleaner air and healthier enviroments.

In conclusion, although cars are a covinient and easy way to get around, they can result in the harming of the enviroment and us as individuals. If we can all lower the emissions and sorts of congestions, the world and people can start to be happy knowing they're living in healthy enviroments with the inspirations of these cities such as Paris and Vauban.     ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
595AA4B43800,"HOLD ON!! Street parking, driveways and home garages have been forbidden in the new district? And if you do want to park your car in a garage you have to buy one for $40,000? What a rip off. But wait.. there is barley any space to park, like, a bus. A lot of people are happy they don't have cars. Everything is near by. The district is really small. If they go out of their house and wanted to walk to their local grocery store the store would be right across the street.

After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Some drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded due to their reaction of the fine. The cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was there to blame. Diesel's made up to 67 percent of vehicles in France compaired to a 53.3 percent average.

In Bogota, Colombia cars have been banned for three years only having buses and taxis as their transportation. If they had a car, they would have recieved a $25 fine. This whole car banning thing was an event because two other cities joined and they were Cali and Valledupar. Colombia isn't that small of a city. People need transportation. I mean, yeah a lot of people mostly hike, but what if they need a car to really get somewhere, like, if it was an emergency? But after this car banning, Colombia has made an improvement. There has been construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city. Uneven, pitted, messed up sidewalks has been replaced with broad, smooth sidewalks.

Obama's goal is to save the greenhouse gas emissions. Obama has been seeing that barley anybody has been buying cars. Why? The money is rising. Cars and gas has been getting expensive. America's love with vehicles has been cooling. In 2005, car driven miles has dropped steadily. In April, 2013, the miles driven per person has dropped 9 percent to where it has been below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Now, the greenhouse has been getting better plants.

In conclusion, car bannings has made a huge improvement in countries and states. Gas is being lessed used, greenhouse has been getting better plants, people don't really need cars if they have everything near buy but in some cases they do for emergency. The driving miles on cars have decreased incredibly. In Bogota the streets, and bicylce lanes have improved. There arent anymore jacked up sidewalks. Money has been saved to make the world look like a better place.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
C2D3552811EC,"Many around the world are limiting car usage and beginning to use other sources of transportation. Cars cause polution and tension to people everywhere. If citizens begin to limit car use and walk, bike or use public transportation instead, people will be much happier and the environment will be too. Citizens of America and Europe are already trying to cut down on driving and limit the excess polution to our environment. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" (Duffer, 14).

Cars cause a great portion of polution to our environment. If citizens of countries around the world limit car usage, then the envirnment we live in will become more safe and less poluted. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive ares in the United States,"" (Rosenthal, 5). Since most cars use gasoline and diesel, they are emitting poisonous gases into the air, this could cause smog. By limiting car usage there will be a positive outcome on our envirnoment. ""It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the envirnoment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants,"" (Rosenthal, 34).

In Bogota, Columbia, there is a day set to be car-free, which allows millions to use sources of transportation other than cars. ""Millions of  Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday,"" (Selsky, 20). By walking, biking, or using public transpotation citizens around the world and even in America, can get around using a car. When driving to work, you can encounter traffic jams, or wrecks, but by using a bike or by walking, you can bypass the stress. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (Rosenthal, 3).

If fellow citizens around the world limit the use of cars, then our environment will be less poluted as well as, less stressful. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" (Selsky, 24). Even young people are limiting the usage of cars. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009..."" (Rosenthal, 41). Take the initiative, and decrease polution and stress by limiting the use of cars.                                                                                 ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
80031EC3D9B6,"From small town suburbs to largely populated cities, car usage can drastically affect a community. In developed worlds, personal automobiles are an increasingly popular trend, and help people go about their day to day business. Many would rather drive down the street to a grocery store of job instead of walking there even though it is common knowledge that the pollution and other harmful emissions cars create is bad for the enviroment and the people living there. The question remains, what are the advantages of limiting car usage?

Many believe that automobiles, especially the very popular ""car"", can be very bad for the enviroment. According to the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", it explains how near-record pollution within Paris caused a partial driving ban. This was to help clean the smog infested air in the dense city. Although many delivery companies complained about lost revenue, congestion within the capitcal lowered by 60 percent. By Monday that week, ""the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"". In another article called ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", this one tells how Bogota, Columbia has also banned cars to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The ban is only for one day a year (called The Day Without Cars), but it's helped cause the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, new, smoot sidewalks, less traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas. Business man, Carlos Plaza claims ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Both of these articles explain how limiting car usage in a city can be benificial to both the city and its residents.

In addition, the United States in partaking in this quest for less cars as well. Article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal shows us that ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" It is possible that this is partially because of the recession; many Americans could not afford cars. Also, more center cities have made the ""suburbs less appealing and has drawn the empty nesters back in"".  If this goes on, scientists believe carbon emissions could greatly reduce and this will be extremely benifical for the enviroment. According to the Mr. Sivak's research, less and less people between the age of 16-39 have been getting licenses. More studies have concluded the same results, but only time will tell in this trend will continue. No matter the reason behind it, this example also demonstrates how limited car usage is benificial.

On the other hand, some believe that less cars is NOT benificial. In source four, it claims that the lowered amount of people driving automobiles will be harmful to the profits of the car industry. To further explain, ""companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves 'mobility' companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"". This, without a doubt, is to combat the loss of sales and encourage people to continue buying their products. However, thos is pretty much all there is on the negative side of limited car usage. For the rest of the community, this doesn't affect them and is in fact quite benificial.

Cars, both the rose and the thorns in a community and enviroment, can be both benificial and harmful to people, depending on who you are. For most regular pedeastrians and citizens within a city, less cars means less pollution, traffic, and stress. Unless you are a business owner of a car dealership or working for a delivery company, limited car usage means very postive things for social relationships, health, the enviroment, and general living conditions of a busy city. The less harmful emissions of gases from cars could greatly affect the outcome of our clean, energy efficient future.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F4A3A95F16D8,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage.  A few of these examples are that it is better for the environment because it reduces greenhouse gasses and causes less polution and smog.  Another advantage is car traveling is becoming less nessasary because of citys like New York and new and improved telecommuting methods.  Also, car usage is becoming less popular, this is because of ""no car days"" and people just not bothering to get a car or a license.

To begin with, when you limit car usage, it is better for the environment because off all the greenhouse gas reduction caused by not using as many cars and other gas producing vehicles as much.  For example, in source 1, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states that "" And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes....passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"".  50 percent is a large number to be taken up by cars alone, if we can reduce car reduction, we can reduce greenhouse gasses.  Another example of why car reduction is an advantage is because of the pollution and smog areas.  You can clearly see this being stated in source 2, by Robert Duffer, ""[The smog] rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""  If Bejing, were to do what Paris did, they too could reduce smog and pollution by car reduction.  Also, in Bogota, Columbia, they have no car days, to limit the amount of smog.  However, limiting car usage to better the environment is not the only reason of why it is an advantage.

Secondly, one other advantage of car reduction is because it is becoming less nessasary to own a car.  For example, as stated in source 4, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, New York, is starting several programs to use cars less, including car-sharing, skyrocket bridge, tunnel tolls, and bike sharing programs.  In that source, it also says that when someone stops using a car, for whatever reason, they find it unnesasary to continue using cars, mostly because some citys are becoming more centralized again, and it's becoming easier to walk to stores.  However, thats not the only reason that it's being less nessasary to own a car. Another reason is because of improved telecommuting methods.  In source 4, Mimi sheller is quoted while talking about how people don't feel the need to drive to see their friend, instead they use their phone or computer to communicate.  Another reason for limiting car usage is because it is becoming less popular.

Thirdly, a lot of citys are starting to have car free days, this is shown in source 3, by Andrew Selsky.  In cities like Bogota, Cali, and Valledupar, all in Columbia, they have ""Day without cars"" this is one example of cars becoming less popular because, even though it was raining, tons of people still participated.  Another example is in source 4, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she says that her children, both of age to get a license and living where one might want a license, still have not gotten there license because they do not think it is nessasary, and they simply stay where they can walk, or ride bikes, or take the bus, or the subway.  Mr. Sivak has shown that the number of 16 to 39 year olds that have a license has significantly reduced.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage including it is better for the environment, it is becoming less nessasary, and it is also becoming less popular.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F5F56C9CD530,"The usage of motor vehicles has been on a steady decline for the last several years.  More and more people are relying on carpooling and other means of transportation. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's articles, she discusses Vauban, Germany, where cars are forbidden and how the use of cars has been on the decline.  In Robert Duffer's article, he talks about Paris' issues with pollution and the ways it has been dealt with.  In Andrew Selsky's article, he talks about a program in Colombia when citizens use other means of transportation other than cars.  The perks of limiting car usage include less pollution, less traffic congestion, and improved safety.

The main culprit of pollution issues is car usage.  In Source 2, Robert Duffer says that ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France...""(Duffer 16) This is because of a tax policy that has a preference to this fuel.  Diesel fuel is a lot more harmful than regular gasoline, and if many people are using this fuel pollution rates will skyrocket.  Cutting down on these fuels altogether could create a less polluted environment.  In addition, cars cause 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and 50 percent in specific places in the U.S(Rosenthal 5).  This statistic is startling, since half of the pollution problems in the U.S are associated to cars.  By using other means of transportation such as the train or even carpooling, this number can be greatly reduced to a much smaller percentage.

With more cars, more traffic congestion occurs.  A sign of this congestion is evident when Rosenthal says""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities.(Rosenthal 37)""  A lot of people are still using their own vehicles to get from point A to B, and as a result their is more money that has been given to toll bridges because of that.  The encouragement of governments to suggest car-pooling services and shared rides will decrease the revenue that comes from tolls.  If everybody shared a ride with a person from work or from somewhere else, there would be a great decrease in traffic congestion.

Furthermore, public transportation such as the BART in the San Francisco Bay area has decreased the amount of drivers on the road.  Although the rides are typically longer than driving a car from point A to B, it is a more efficient method of transportation.(Rosenthal 40)  Using these alternate methods of transportation decreases the amount of cars on the road at once.  With less cars on the road at once, there is more efficiency in getting where you need to go.

Safety is one of the most important aspects of reducing the amount of cars. In Colombia, a program promotes the use of no cars one day per year.  Many of the citizens use alternate methods of transportation such as walking and riding bikes.(Selsky 20)By promoting this, there are obviously less cars on the road and a lesser risk of people being injured by cars.  With programs that promote other modes of transportation, many lives can be saved since there would be fewer cars on the road.  Although many people require cars to get from place to place, the idea of lives being saved is something that shouldn't be ignored.  Also, technology has aided the decline in cars. Telecommunication has helped people become connected to friends and family in a way without meeting with them face to face.(Rosenthal 35) Because of this,  people dont have to travel to meet with their friends and family.  This has created a domino effect; people can communicate through social media and texting which causes less cars to be on the road to visit other people and overall causes less safety isssues.

In conclusion, cars are the focal point of many issues in our society.  They cause many safety issues such as traffic accidents,more traffic congestion which causes increases in revenue in tolls, and pollution issues.  By reducing car usage, many of these problems can disappear, and can create a safer and healthier environment.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B3C35FE7E3B3,"In today's world, many of us see cars as a necesarry tool used to get us where we need to go in the shortest time possible. However, what many do not realize is how much restricting our usage of the personal automobile will actually help society in the long run. Decreasing our usage of the car will not only cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, but will also improve congestion and see an a boost in the economy of cities and countries around the world.

There is no doubt that cutting down on driving will greatly reduce the emission of grennhouse gases. As detailed in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, the effect of just one day of reduced driving played a signifigant impact on the amount of smog in Paris, France. The smog which covered the city of Paris rivaled that of Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The cause of the intense fog is thought to be diesel fuel, which is the most commonly used type of automobile fuel in France. Because of this, Paris has a very high smog concentration compared to other Western European capitals. The temporary ban on driving drastically improved the conditions in Paris, and the ban was lifted after only one day. If this idea of reducing the use of automobiles spreaded to other car-dependent countries such as the U.S., there is no telling how much the impact of society on the emission of greenhouse gasses will reduce.

Additionally, the increasingly popular idea of favoring walking or biking over driving to one's destination has seemed to have a signifigant impact around the world. In the passage ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, the capital city of Bogota, Colombia has participated in the Day Without Cars program for three straight years. This has led to an increase in the creation of bicycle paths and cut down on congestion and traffic jams normally common in the city. In addition, the uprising of parks and recreation centers has also helped to boost the city's economy. However, this program has not been restricted to Bogota, as many people from countries around the world have come to see the event. This has the potential to become an internationally now phenomena, which will greatly improve the health and well-being of the people of the world. New bicycling opprotunities will mean no longer getting in traffic jams and will reduce stress and congestion in the long run.

In conclusion, the limiting of car usage would have a profound impact on our society, not only on pollution and the envorinment, but on our personal well-being. The limiting of our dependency on cars has had a great effect on the emission of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and smog has the potential to be removed from modern cities all together; the economy would also benefit, as fewer cars means fewer roads needing to be built and an increase of bicycle trails, parks, and shopping centers in walking distance of neighborhoods. Overall, the limiting of car usage would have a fantastic impact on society and our world as a whole.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

We are having a movement where cars aren't needed, it's a slow process were you won't see the result until you compare back then to now. This change is happening due to people living a more active life, and minimizing global warming in small ways that have big results.

There is hardly any accidents involving cars because there is no use for them. we are living a life were you dont have to be afraid of crossing the street, and people in cars don't have to be tense for fear that they might crash someone. Living a life were your life does not center around a car is not something you would expect to have such great results, but, it does people are genuinely happy that they aren't driving cars. Not having a car has given so much relief and less tension to people, knowing that they are active and getting from point A to point B while doing it.

We have so much pollution going on and one of the biggest causes of it is cars.

For these countries they felt that this was a great idea to stop their smog and pollution problem.
