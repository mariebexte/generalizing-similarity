4E70543A2909,"""I have a accomplished so much by taking extracurricular activities."" said Generic_Name, a student at Generic_School. She believes that extracurricular activities can help out with many things in and outside of school, I agree. Students should participate in them because one can make friends, and it is better than being alone indoors all day. Although, some will say that students might get behind with their priorities.

To begin, in most activities kids will become friends with the other students there. Usually students will start by getting to know each other first. This would be by talking to each other to know who they will be with for the rest of the season/year. Next, as time goes people will start creating bonds and growing relationships with their peers. Friendships that become really close are always something special and should last forever. Once people start becoming friends they might choose to hangout and be together. This adds to the list of things to do when bored, hanging out with friends. Having and making friends is something important, extracurricular's will help with that.

Second, when participating in extracurricular activities it is better than staying inside all day. Most of the time activities are going to require you to interact with new people. Students can get to see the world and a lot of the time, learn new things. If the students' activity is a sport then they will probably be outside. This is good because they will need the fresh air at some point. Most teens nowadays are always inside playing video games. Finally, one will expand their knowledge to more that just school and home. This way their path will not be going from home to school then back. Getting to go outside has many positives that come with it, and it happens because of the activities.

Some may say that if students take part in extracurricular activities they will get behind on their priorities. This may include homework, chores, and anything else. If they are so busy out and about when will they have time? If that is the case the student can choose an activity that will help them. Some options include homework clubs, or AVID. They are meant to help students out in school. It would be an opportunity to further and better themselves.

Students should take part in at least one extracurricular activity. One can make friends, and it is better than being alone and indoors. In addition students can find an activity to better their education. Extracurricular activities have helped me as well.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
5716C4DAFC9E,"""SLAM!"" Generic_Name throws the door back behind her. Generic_Name's mother flies down the stairs so fast, she nearly face plants into the wall ahead. ""What's the matter honey?"" ""Ughh! My new principal just announced that all students are now required to participate in an extracurricular activity everyday after school, and i don't have any interest in that!"" Generic_Name shrieks.""Well why is that such a bad thing?"" her mom says calmly.""That's the point! i don't want to waste my time after school on something stupid like that. I would rather be relaxing by myself after all of my homework,"" Generic_Name answers irritably. ""Come on, you could make new friends, and might surprise yourself with new interests.""I think it would be really good for you,"" her mom explains. ""Well I disagree,"" Generic_Name responds. ""Please would you give it a try? I see opportunity for you here. I really do,"" Her mom pushes. ""I don't need more people or friends in my life. Besides, none of the activities offered sound appealing to me at all,"" Generic_Name says. "" How about cross country? You know your dad and i used to do it when we were younger, and when you were little you always talked about how you wanted to be a runner like me when you got older. Just try it, and if you really don't like it, i'll go talk to your principal about the requirement,"" her mom offers. ""I don't know,"" Generic_Name contemplates. ""Think about all of the great opportunities and things that could come out of this!"" Generic_Name's mom says positively. ""Please?"" her mom tries one last time. Generic_Name sighs. ""I guess,"" she finally agrees. Forced extracurricular activities will benefit students in many ways, especially by motivating ones that do not typically do activities. Our school should continue to require students to participate in extracurricular activities because it provides balance in their schedules, helps them to build new friendships, and gives them the opportunity to try new things.

The first reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it provides balance in students' schedules. Balance is one thing that is very important, especially when it comes to middle and high school; colleges look at whether a student can manage an activity with all of the school work as a big factor in the admissions process. For example, My older sister applied to UVA last year; She had straight A's, a great GPA and SAT score, but got denied because she wasn't a balanced student. She claims that if she would have had a required extracurricular activity, she would have had a better high school experience because it would force her to have a little more fun, which she needed at the time.

Another example of the lack of balance is that my older brother comes home stressed and angry everyday because he's so determined about keeping his grades up in high school. His favorite sport used to be football, until his classes started getting harder and he stopped playing. However, next year he is going to step down from one of his hard classes, so he can play football again and still keep his grades up; therefore, he will regain his much needed balance again. If our school continues to require these extracurricular activities, it will prepare students for high school by showing them that they need to have a balanced school-work life to both mentally and physically succeed.

The next reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it helps students build new friendships. It is very important to have good friends throughout middle school and high school because you will need people to talk to about things, support you in situations. and even just to share laughter and spend time with that aren't your family. For example, when i started middle school my parents made me try out for track, which i really didn't want to do. After a few days, i had made so many great friends that i could not only hang out with at practice, but i also then knew them at school. To this day, i am even better friends with those people, therefore, i can't imagine what my life would be like if i hadn't tried out for track. Another example is my older brother made his closest friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, in football when he first started high school. Before that, he didn't have many good friends; football really changed his life in that way, for i never see him happier than when he is with them.

The final reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it gives students the opportunity to try new things. If you aren't required to do something, most of the time you probably won't do it unless it interests you; however if you are required to do something, you will be forced to do it no matter what, but you might surprise yourself, and find interest in that thing after all. Like mentioned previously, my parents made me try out for track when i first started middle school. At first, i wasn't the biggest fan of the idea, but i decided to give it a try; i ended up surprising myself, and Absolutely loved it. I was one of the best sprinters on my team, and found running to be a great way to release my negative energy from the day. Another example of this is my friend Generic_Name; she had no interest in sewing at all, but her mom forced her to try the sewing club at her school. Vivian ended up really enjoying it, and found it very therapeutic, as it was a great way to let out her stresses from the school day.

Squeak! Generic_Name's front door's hinges make a sound as she opens it. The stench of sweat fills the kitchen as Generic_Name and her friends topple in, one after another.""Oh my goodness you girls stink!"" Generic_Name's mom laughs and plugs her nose. ""Did you have a good run?"" She asks. ""Yes we're loving it!"" Generic_Name exclaims with a huge grin. ""I knew you would,"" her mom winks at her.

By continuing to extracurricular activities, schools will positively benefit students by providing balance in their schedules, building new friendships, and giving them the opportunity to try new things.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
7.10E+11,"I agree with the principal that the students should participate in an after school activity. I believe that it could be a good way for the students to find new friends with the same interests as them. Students could also try to find clubs that catch their interest if they didn't have a club that they wanted to join, and maybe they would enjoy that club. Staying after school for clubs could get kids off of there phones, and help them to stay active. Another reason why staying after could be beneficial is that the students get an opportunity to do the things they like, that they may not have the opportunity to do at school or at home.

Students could find other students in that club with the same interests as them, and they could become friends. The students will make new friends because they all have at least one thing in common with each other. If they were to hang out more, then they could start to find out that they have a lot more in common. Making new friends at that activity will make the students want to go back to that activity so they can see their friends again. This would go perfectly with the idea that the principal had. The student wants to go to something that the principal is telling them that they have to go to. This gives the principal what they want, and it gives the students what they want.

Going to the activity will make kids use their free time constructively. Usually when students get home from school, they use their time being on their phone or playing video games. When they go to an after school activity, they use some of their free time constructively. If the student went to the sports club, then they would get more physical exercise. If the student does yearbook, then they get to learn about different activities going on throughout the school. If the student participates in the student council, then that student gets to help the community through service projects. All of those clubs provide better use of the students time, rather than just sitting at home doing nothing. If the students actually enjoy cutting back on devices, then would try to manage their time so they are staying away from screens and doing something that is stimulative.

Sometimes none of the activities catch the eyes of a student. Maybe if they were forced to choose one activity, they would find a passion in that activity that they didn't know that they had. Some students don't have enough hobbies, if they even have any at all. Making them choose an activity could possibly interest them in whatever they chose, and they would start to take up that activity as a hobby. Now that the student has a hobby, that student will most likely spend time doing that hobby instead of doing the other activities that keep the student from being productive. The student will now think that if he gives something new a try, they will enjoy whatever it the new activity is. Now he will want to do other new activities that exercise either his body or his mind. Soon his free time will be filled with the hobbies that are good for him and not the time wasting ones.

If the student already enjoys one of the activities provided, then it gives the student an opportunity to participate in that activity. Sometimes students just can't find time in their busy schedules to do the things that they enjoy. Staying after school would be the perfect time for that student to do the activity that they want to do. Maybe the student wasn't selected for the yearbook elective in school, but because there is a yearbook activity after school; that student can now do yearbook like she wanted to. Some parents can't afford for their child to do certain activities like play a sport. If there was an opportunity for the students to stay after to do a sport for free, they would take it. The student gets to do something that they have always wanted to do, but that their parents could never afford. Many students just want to do something that they enjoy with their free time, and after school is the perfect time to do it.

The principal making the kids stay after for an activity will most likely result in a positive outcome for the students. Whether it results in new friendships, trying new things, or just being able to do something that the student loves. The principal should make every student participate in and after school activity, because it is beneficial to them. That is why I agree with the principal and his decision to make every kid do an after school activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
22F3B43D815D,"Everyone at school should and will participate on a school sports team. You may not be the most athletic or social person. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't participate. Because you never know you may find something you really like. Here is why everyone should participate in a school sport.

Some people choose not to participate or try out for a school sport. This is only hurting them. When someone chooses not to participate in a school offered sport such as football, softball, volleyball, or lacrosse. They take a risk of not getting the physical activity they need. If they don't get the exercise they need they may become very unhealthy. They are even also missing out on opportunity's to make new friends.

When students choose not to participate in sports. They may be missing out on some valuable life long friendships. From personal experience I know that if I didn't start playing softball I wouldn't have some of the friendships and memories I have today. With the people I have become friends with i'm sure that we will stay friends, through high school and even college as we grow throughout softball careers together. So if you think you aren't good enough still tryout because you never know you could make friendships that last a lifetime.

School sports are again a good idea for everyone. Parents may think that it is not a good idea to play sports because it is dangerous. Even though they think this kids will have fun and make memories. Parents also might say ""not every single kid wants to play sports!"" That may be true but another sport they can play if they don't enjoy high contact, fast pace sports is competitive chess. Or they could make a new club where they can incorporate stuff they like and make up a new sport. That they would enjoy more than the other sports.

With the options an evidence given, it is a good idea to play sports. Because, it makes kids more physically active, creates new friendships, and allows kids to have the fun they can't have during class. A principal should make kids play sports because it can be fun and educational at the same time. And lastly it teaches them how to be good people and shows them valuable life skills and lessons.  ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
F7341069C4A4,"""Oh man I didn't make the soccer team!"", yelled Generic_Name. ""At least there are football tryouts next week"", replied Generic_Name. ""Im so glad that there are many extracurricular activities that our school provides!"", said Generic_Name. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school because it could be a good use of time for them, they can create a passion for themselves, and they could help out the school.

A reason why students should participate in extracurricular activities is because it could be a good use of time for them. After school, many students play video games or take a nap which is not a good use of precious time. Instead, students could use their time wisely by staying active and helping out others. For example, Generic_Name plays video game all day long after school. If Generic_Name had something to do after school, it would keep away from video games and he could be having fun a different way.

Another reason why students should participate in extracurricular activities at school is because they can create a passion for themselves in doing so. Many students don't know what they want their career to be in the future. Being involved in extracurricular activities can help them find a passion for themselves. For example, Generic_Name signed up for art club for the first time. After his first few days, Generic_Name grew a passion for drawing and painting.

Before, Generic_Name wasn't sure about what he wanted to do when he grows up. Now, he wants to be a graphic designer and take his drawing skills to another level.

The last reason why students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they could be helping out the school. Kids can join programs that help out teachers and students. Programs like student council and more can make others jobs easier. For example, Generic_Name ran for student body president and won. Now, he can help out students and teachers when by decisions and changes for the school.

"" I'm glad I got over my video game addiction"", said Generic_Name. ""Now I can focus on my future"".

In conclusion, Students should participate in extracurricular activities because it could be a good use of time for them, they can create a passion for themselves, and they could help out the school.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
58453EDC66BA,"Many people don't take after school activities and some do that is just the type of person and they desicion of that person or their parents. I don't take an after school activity because I feel like it would stress me out, and when I get stressed out I get angry extremely fast. My parents don't make me do because they think it is for the best to let me choose that desicion but some parents do make them because they feel it's for the best. So I disagree with this statement because some students may have busy a life, some may be having family issues happening at the certain moment, and others may not be interested in a certain activity.

One thing is some kids may have busy lives and they can't make the time for it. An example is if a kid has a after school job and they have to work on certain days. It means they would either need to get special permission from the school or would they have to take kids away from their job. Another example is if the kid has a lot of homework and they have a certain amount of time. They would have to stay up all night in order to finish the homework because of an after school activity.

Some of the students may be going through some family issues at that current moment. What about if a student's parents are going through a divorce. That student could have continuous panic attacks or having mood swings the would probably get in them trouble. Also what if one of the student's relatives are sick or got into an accident. The relative would probably want the student there a lot because it could be getting worse or they could be close to death, the student wouldn't have time to see them.

My last example is if the student is not interested in a certain extracurricular. They student may get signed up for a sport he doesn't like but is required to take. He probably wouldn't try his best because he doesn't find the sport interesting or just doesn't really care. Also if the student attempted to sign up for something but doesn't make it, so they sign him up something he doesn't like. If a student would attempted to sign up for track but doesn't make it he might get signed up for volleyball but he doesn't enjoy volleyball.

So in conclusion I don't think it is fair to force students and their peers to do after school activities and it should be students or his parents choice. If a kid doesn't want to take a extracurricular it is their right not to and if they do, they choose an extracurricular. I believe it is the students choice to choose, or the parents of that certain student and not the school. So I disagree with it because some students could have a busy life like having a job, they could have family issues like a divorce, and theirs may not be interested in a certain activity like football or baseball.    ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
AA1F3740A24D,"Imagine you are a student at a school which offers you two extracurricular activities, a gaming club and a football club. You don't like either since you are not good at sports and you don't know how to play video games, but you are forced to do one anyway! The principal of a school has decided that all students have to at least do one extracurricular activity. I however, disagree with forcing students to do an extracurricular activity because it can be a distraction from their homework and study, not fun, and in some cases can be stressful.

The first reason why I disagree with forcing a student to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can be a distraction from their work as an average student has to spend an extra 1-2 hours of their sleep doing their homework and projects due to other activities such as chores. With enough jobs to cut hours out of their sleep, it does not make any sense to expect students to have to do extra work since most extracurricular activities want or expect work of its session. It just doesn't make any sense for a student who doesn't want to join an extracurricular activity to be forced to join and do extra work there.

The next reason to why I disagree with forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can be not fun nor entertaining to a student. Why a student doesn't join an extracurricular activity in the first place is because he/she does not find the activities fun. Being force to participate in an activity a student doesn't find fun to replace it with the time they could be doing something they enjoy just doesn't sound right as students should be able to enjoy what they like doing the most. The principal when proposing the idea of forcing students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity must only have assumed that all students find the extracurricular activities provided is interesting although there are many who do not find the activities interesting.

The final reason why I disagree with forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can cause stress. Extracurricular activities can add more work to a student's life which can therefore, invoke stress. Many students already have problems trying to establish their sleep schedule because of an overwhelming amount of school work. With an extracurricular activity that demands a lot of attention, it will be definitely stressful. The principal has yet again clearly not take a moment of forethought when deciding about this course of action, especially for the students working hard to meet grade requirements and studying for exams and Sols.

I disagree with forcing students to do an extracurricular activity because it can be a distraction from their homework and study, not fun, and in some cases can be stressful. Extracurricular activities can be a distraction from a student's already homework-filled schedule, take over time for students to be doing what they find fun, and be very stressful especially for those already doing an activity that is very time consuming. There is indeed a lot of students who finds extracurricular activities fun and easy but the voices of the people who finds extracurricular activities hard and time consuming is important and should be heard too, therefore, we shouldn't force students who don't want to participate in extracurricular activities to do so.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
138BB07570E0,"Have you ever done a extracurricular activity like a sport, a club, or just a service? What if your school told you that you had to do one. What would you pick and would agree or disagree with them? I would agree because doing a extracurricular activity can have many benefits like, being fun, helping the community, and it can even be good for you.

The first reason I think everyone should do a extracurricular activity is because it is fun. Doing a activity that you are good can be a lot of fun, but you can also pick one you do not know and learn something new. You can do the same activities as your friends and spend time together and have a lot of fun.

One more reason you should do a extracurricular activity is that you can help the community while do your activity. There are many ways you can help the community like joining a clean up club, volunteering at the library, or just giving any type of service. It is a great way to give back to the community. It can also be very good for nature and the environment.

Lastly, doing a extracurricular activity can be good for you. It can help balance out school work and gives you something more fun to do. It can also be good in a physical way if you are playing a sport or something involving exercise. Overall it will make you energetic and a lot happier.

In conclusion I think everyone should be required to do a extracurricular activity because it has many benefits. Being fun, helping the community, and being good for you are only a few of them.

5E14CA138C09,"Have you ever had that feeling when you get home, finish your homework, maybe hangout with some friends and your still bored? Well, an extracurricular activity like a sport or a club would really be great for you! I think that every student should do at least one extracurricular activity because, it would help students make new friends, and students could earn scholarships while learning on the way.

Doing something else around the community would really get yourself out there to make new friends and open up new opportunities. This would help you later in life when you might need to make friends in college, and those friends would help you out before your exams and other times like that. All in all this is just something everybody should do. It doesn't pack your schedule too much because, if your day is already too chaotic then you probably already are doing an extracurricular activity and you don't need to do another.

This doesn't just help make new friends, trying out new clubs and sports would help you find your thing. This ""thing"" could be what you really like doing or what your good at doing. Its not only for a great time, but you could earn scholarships to the hardest colleges to attend. You could earn one by simply being good at any sport, or even through a club!

First , I agree because the activties keep students busy. Instead of the students going home to play, they can stay after school and participate in different activites. Students will continue to learn about new things. In school, I decided to do band after school. I enjoy that activity and I learned how to play new instruments.

Next , I agree because the activities can be fun for students. The activites can be fun because the students can participate in different clubs like art, cooking, gardening, boys and girls, and drama. Students can also have time to talk and laugh with their friends. My friend and I have been going to the boys and girls club. We have a lot of fun and weÃÂ´ve met new people.

How can extracurricular activites be benefical to students?

Have you ever wondered why people try excurricular activites? Extracurricular activites are often before or after school or even on the weekends. Some examples of extracurricular actiivities are sports or clubs. I agree that it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help boost students mental health, improve social skills and be given a chance to try new things.

The first reason why it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can help boost students mental health. Studies have shown that more excercise is benefical and improves overall mood. Extracurricular activitives,especially sports, have a physical component that gives students the chance to be active. Being active has shown in studies that it improves sleep cycles and overall improves mental health. Being in a extracurricular activity can help boost mental health.

The second reason why it would be benefifical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can help improve social skills. Making friends doesn't come easy to everyone and joining an activity can give students the chance to meet new people. Joining an extra activity can introduce you to many people who over time, will get to know you and possibly want to become friends. Being a part of an extracurricular activity can help you meet new people and can make it eaiser to make friends or just talk to people in general. An extracurricular activity can help imporve social skills.

The third reason why it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can give students the chance to try new things. All activites have a main focus like soccer or art club, but all activites have a little thing they do that is unique. Having the chance to be part of a club is a new thing in itself and you should take advantage of that try a new thing. Being in an extracirricular activity can give students the chance to try new things.

In conclusion, I agree that it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help boost students mental health, improve social skills and be given a chance to try new things. School is a chance to try new things. So take advantage of the oppurtinites that you are given to try something and see how it goes. So how can you take advantage of extracurricular oppurtinites?",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A3E8AF823886,"Imagine doing something that you dont feel like doing. My school is making all students do an extracurricular activity. The problem is that people might have to go some were after school or people cant wake up so early in the morning just to do an activity. You also got homework and maybe you already have activity.

Homework is important because it can help you learn better and under stand some thing you didnt know. Homework can get easy because you do it so many time. Its so easy it takes less time to do it. If You have a project its important to do that. project are more points then homework and can give your grade a boost.

Activity are fun and is also practice to for like a sport. Sport activities are allot of hard work. All of that hard work can get you a successful job. An activity can make socil with people and make friends. Friends can help you with things like homework or if you are getting bullied.

DC6181711B08,"I think students should not have to participate because they might not enjoy it,they could fail, or they have other things to do. It's not fair to make a student do something like this it could cause hurt rather then help. The choice should be up to the student. The principal may have his reasons but there are string reason against this rule as well.

They might not enjoy it,Not everyone is good at something. The simple fact of the matter is not everyone gets along with teachers and students alike. That could cause a person to dislike extracurricular Charles Darwin once said ""Do what you love and love what you do"". In my opinion if you dont love or even like something it makes it harder and harder to get up and go put energy into doing it. So in the end enjoying the extracurricular activity is a big part.

They could fail lets say everyone else got spots in there favorite group or club and you where stuck with something like yearbook design. You know when it comes to being creative you are the worst but your barely passing school now so you give it a shot. Your teacher tells you that you are failing yearbook design and it could affect your graduating but if you hadnt taken the class you woundn't be making A's but you would be passing. All of this over one class that you wouldnt be taking if it wasnt for your principal and his new rule. I think that there are better ways for students to get involved not because they are forced but because they want to.

They could also have other things to do like how a lot of kids now a days have siblings. Which could be a huge problem if they have to join extracurricular. Parents work and older siblings have to watch there younger ones but meetings for this club that the student had to join is after school. How should the student get there or why should they have to worry about this anyway. Its harder for some people to do things like that its just a fact.

In conclusion there are more cons to making students get involved in extracurricular then there are pros. Everyone life is different and expecting every students to be able to do something like this could cause them to dislike things,fail or even skip it all together due to other things. In my opinion its a bad idea the time could be spend better. The average student goes to school 8 hours a shouldnt that be enough.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
ABF484B46756,"Imagine this: You are an adult looking back at your schooling experience. Were you in any clubs? If you were, chances are you have fond memories of that time. However, does that mean extracurricular activities should be required at school? Many people have strong opinions on the topic. Extracurricular activities should be required.

One reason why clubs should be required in school is that being in a club provides skills that are extremely helpful throughout life. According to Brian Scott, an expert on youth development at the University of Social Sciences, extracurricular activities in school are some of the best ways that the youth can prepare to enter the working world. Scott explains that this is true because after school activities give kids further experience with important skills such as communication and team work. Furthermore, a study conducted by the Department of Youth Development found that 87% of adults who participated in extracurricular activities in school thought that being in an extracurricular activity gave them skills that helped them later in life. One possible reason why extracurricular activities could have helped people after they have completed their schooling experience is that it gave them important skills and character traits such as perseverance or good communication. All things considered, extracurricular activities give those who participate quality life skills.

Another reason why after school activities should be required is that it gives the participants helpful experience. Evidence for this is found by the University of Statistics who conducted a study that found that 76% of people who were a part of extracurricular activities during their school experience thought that the experience from those clubs is helpful to them in their careers. Some ways that clubs can help in careers is it can give students experience in their chosen career path. Examples of clubs that are best at providing experience specific to future careers is the math club where students can participate in competitions or the newspaper club where students can practice for journalism. The experience students gain from joining extracurricular activities in school can also be helpful when applying to colleges, if students choose to go down that route. According to the board of applications for the prestigious College of Law, one of the top things they look for in an application is what extracurricular activities the applicant participated in while in school. One member even said, ""I value extracurriculars even more than the grade point average when I am decided who gets in."" As you can see, the experience gained from clubs in school has many benefits including college and job applications.

Another reason why extracurricular activities can be beneficial to students is that it gives students an opportunity to make new friends with similar interests. The Department of Youth Statistics stated that one of the best ways for students to make friends is by letting students choose what activities to do and pairing those with similar interests together. That is exactly what clubs do. Furthermore, it is proven by the University of Psychology that when students have a healthy amount of friends, they are less likely to fail their classes and more likely to succeed. Based on that, extracurricular activities can cause students to be more successful than their peers who do not partake in those activities.

However, some people argue that students should be able to choose whether or not they want to participate in extracurricular activities in school. They cite people such as Jessica Grant, a professor from the West Virginia University of Psychological Studies, who said, ""when people have a choice in what they do, they tend to feel the benefits much more than those who are forced to do something."" While that might be true, students who are required to participate in at least one extracurricular do have a choice in what club or clubs they join. That choice is explained well by Dr. Matthew Brown, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington State who said, ""even when students are required to participate in something -- either a class or an activity -- they still always have some sort of choice, whether that is what activity to do or what mindset to have."" Using both sets of logic previously stated, when the students choose what club to participate in, they will experience the largest amount of positive results.

All in all, a requirement in schools should be extracurricular activities. Clubs give students important life skills and experiences, as well as new friends. If clubs are required, then young adults would be much more prepared to transition out of school and in to the working world.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0

Have you ever considered joining an after school club? How about a sport? Or maybe even student council? There are many different activities to choose from that all have unique benefits. Participating in an extracurricular activity would be very beneficial because most colleges like when you have school related activities, they give you something to do, and it's an opportunity to make new friends.

When completing a college application, they'll want to know more about you. One way to show them that you're well rounded is joining clubs. It displays that you have a variety of interests. As a result, the probability of you being accepted into a certain college is increased. The more activities the better.

Not only are extracurriculars beneficial for college, but they also give you something to do. Would you rather be sitting in your bedroom and staring at the wall or learning new skills and having fun? If you're more interested in the arts, then you could join theater or drama club. If you prefer being active and competitive, then you could join a sport. No matter what you decide on, you'll enjoy yourself and learn simultaneously.

Extracurriculars are an excellent opportunity to create new friendships and learn more communication skills. Everyone has one common interest and that brings people together. Finding a friend or two is very likely. By making new friends, your communication skills will certainly improve.

In conclusion, extracurriculars are very beneficial because they impress colleges, provide entertainment, and create long lasting friendships. So think about joining theater, chess club, or playing basketball.

Consider all of the benefits you may receive.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
E758B77AC952,"Do you want to stay after school everyday for something you dont want to do?

Our principle has decided to make every student take an extracurricular activity.

I have decided to write about why I dont like the idea of extracurricular activities.

I disagree with extracurricular activities because students are tired at the end of the day,students might have somethings to do after school,and the teachers dont want to stay after school everyday.

First, we should not have extracurricular activities because students are tired at the end of the day. For example,students have seven to eight hours a day of school so they are going to be exhausted at the end of school. For instance,students might have had a test and they have to stay after school for an extracurricular activity. students would start to dislike school for making them stay after school for activities they dont want to do. For example, students dont want to stay in school for more than seven or eight hours a day, It's exhausting to have to stay in school for up to nine hours for activities you dont want to do. We should not have to take an extracurricular activity.

Also, students should not have to take an extracurricular activity because students might have somethings to do after school. For example, students might have chores to do around there home, not every student can stay after school everyday. For example, students might have a doctor's appointment after school and they cant stay after school and students have to get a note from there parents saying they have a doctor's appointment. For instance,Students might be on a sports team and they have to go to training or they have a game,what are they going to do then? Students should not have to take an after school activity.

Finally,The students should not be forced to take an extra activity because the teachers dont want to stay after school everyday. For example Teachers have longer hours than the students. Teachers get to school before the students, and leave school after the students and sometimes they even stay after school. Teachers are exhausted after school and the teachers choose to stay after school, they should not have to stay after school everyday. For instance,teachers are going to be cranky at the end of the day because there may be some kids who made the teacher angry or the teacher is just tired at the end of the day either way the teachers should not have to stay after school, only the ones who choose to stay after school should stay. For example,teachers choose to stay after school to grade students work and teacher choose a day or two to stay after school to help the students who need help and if they stayed after school everyday they would not want to stay after school to grade or to help the students with work. Teachers should not have to stay after school everyday.

'If students stayed after school everyday they would not have time to do what they like at home.''

I disagree with extracurricular activities and we should not have to take an extra activity after school because students are tired at the end of the day,students might have somethings to do after school,and teachers dont want to stay after school everyday.

Students should not be forced to take an extracurricular activity because they have seven to eight hours of school a day, they might be on a sports team or have chores,and teachers dont want to stay after school everyday.

Students, we all should convince our principals that we should not have to take an extracurricular activity we already have a lot of things to do at home and at school.    ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
ABFA0C962CA1,"Extra curricular activities give students an opportunity to be on a team or with a group of people with shared interests as them. They are very beneficial for students, but many kids don't participate in after school activities because they are to busy with school.

Because some parents force there kids to spend little to no time with there friends and hours studying. Their kids may end up with little social skills and poor mental health. Though excessive time studying may seem beneficial; to much time studying actually harms the students. Mandatory extra curricular activities would help to give students more control over their lives and let them to have a social life. Many adults would have never thought to try any after school activities if their school didn't force them to, yet so many parents don't allow there kids to participate in those activities that they once loved as a kid. A lot of students feel at ease when doing a sport or playing their instrument, and they never would have thought to try it if they had no reason to. Making students participate in extra curricular activities is beneficial for their physical and mental health because it helps students make more friends and find their passion.

Since there is so much pressure for student to maintain a high GPA, some students make studying more of a priority than their social life. It gets so extreme to the point where some students spend all there time doing homework, but spend little to no time hanging out with their friends. This makes students struggle socially. Extra curricular activities give students a chance to take a break from homework and be in a group of people with the same interests and same goal as them. Pushing students to do extra curricular activities would help them to spend less time studying and more time spent on an activity that they love. There are a lot of students that are strong academically, but many of those students can't communicate with other people or work in a team, so no matter how smart they are they wouldn't excel in any job. Because every job requires communication and social skills, students need to develop those skills while still in school to get a secure job in their future. Increasing communication and teamwork is not the only reason that after school activities are beneficial.

There are many adults that would have never found their passion if there weren't activities for them to try. Since stress is only increasing for students, they tend to spend more time studying trying to improve already good grades then doing an activity that they love. Students feel so stuck feeling like they can only do school work, but when they have other activities it can really clear their head; as well as make them realize that they work well in a certain field. For example if a student were to join the SCA and like it they could realize that they want to take on more leadership roles and one day run a company. If that student was forced to study and had no free time to be on the SCA they may have never realized how much they like leadership roles. They may have never gotten the chance to start the company and there life would be so different. Plus students are more likely to get accepted in a good college for continuing with an activity that they love with a slightly lower GPA then having a perfect GPA, never have participating in any extra curricular activities, so after school activities are also helping students to get into college.

A lot of extra curricular activities are offered, and by making them mandatory it will make many students realize that they are passionate about some things. Whether that activity be a sport, an instrument, or a leadership role. While there is something out there for everyone students wanting to participate in an activity isn't as common as many may think. Pushing students to find their activity will help them in their future. There is no way out of communication and teamwork so giving students the opportunity to learn those skills in school only benefits them. By not enforcing extra curricular activities on students, many students futures are being harmed. By not letting kids have social lives or giving students the opportunity to find their passion students are going to struggle in their future adult life a lot more then they ever needed to struggle. This can be avoided by just simply making after school activities mandatory; having students focus on things other then school and studying.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
D8BDF61F6010,"67% of students show beneficial growth through participating in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities help yourself out. Here is how I think that extracurricular activities can benefit you. Extracurricular activities are very beneficial because student can learn new life skills, they can help out with their school, and they can gain physical health.

First of all, students can learn new skills that they can use in everyday life. Students can learn helpful communication skills by joining an activities that involve communication. For instance, If a student learns new communication skills then they can use them to get a job and become successful. It is not just communication it is learning how to act to someone. I promise if you learn these skills you will be benefited.

Secondly, you can help out your school by encouraging other people. By encouraging other people, not only will you help other people, but you will help yourself. As an example, if you serve on the student council you can help your school become a better place. Encouraging other people makes you feel good inside like you did something that made an impact.

lastly, students can gain physical health by participating on sports. Obesity is a problem in our country, but if we encourage children to get active. We can lower that number. Student could also find a sport that fits them, so they enjoy it. It can also make them stay with that sport for longer. Students also can find playing a sport can be really fun. If the children like the sport they will see the benefit it will bring them.

By learning new life skills, helping out with your school , and participating in physical activity you will see the benefit it brings you. If you do these things great, if you dont do them please do them, you will see benefit. Extracurricular activities are not just regular activities, they are activities you can learn from. Extracurricular activities are there so you try and learn new things, because if your not learning or trying we won't get anywhere.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
6B9A69F6E448,"My school is adding a rule. the rule is every one needs to play a type of sport or needs to do something related like help around the school. I agree on this because the teachers often get tired of teaching and will do more for the school activities. Most students don't do any activities at home and can develop hobbies by helping around the school. Also the teachers may not think of good,fun ideas so the students can get creative on the activities. The students can also plan any dances coming up or can come up with some type of events that are coming up for the school.

There are teachers that work all day and get home till every one leaves the school and if she got chosen to be a helper around the school she would get home even more late then usual. Teachers are very hardworking and always get exhausted while teaching cause she is talking all day. The students are basically helping cause they are taking out time of there day to some activities at there school. Teachers dont need to do as much work as they normally do and the students can help them at anything cause its a activity to help around the school.

There are a lot of students that dont do any activities at home and can maybe help around the school rather than be at home and do nothing. There are many students that are not athletic than other people and cant do many sports because they are not fit for the sport or dosen't ant to get hurt. Helping around the school cant get any body hurt. They can also help the school by improving it by adding some new things to the school. They can interact with people if they are always going to be at the school. they can develop some type of hobbie just by helping around the school.

They students can also create some fun ideas for the school cause they may be more open minded. The students can plan some upcoming events for the school cause that may have more fun and better ideas than teachers. There are more students that can come up with some GOOD ideas for dances,any type of upcoming events. Many teachers cant come up with fun ideas cause they dont know what type of music we like neither food.

I agreed because there arent as many students that do stuff at home or just dont like doing any activities. There are many teachers that often get more tired than others so which means the students can do some work for them if needed or just help around the school not just the teachers. The students can make the school have a better name because of the sportsman ship they are having.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
D496BF3A284F,"One day you principal decides that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, this can range from sports to running for student council. This may sound great at first but once you analyze the situation and realize this may not be ideal for all families, you will see why this idea should be expelled right away.

To begin, the main question we should be asking is why, why are these students being told they have to participate in these activities?

Not only should we be asking why, we should be asking;

What would happen if they don't?

From family matters, money issues, transportation, to school work,, there are many reasons a student may not be able to participate in these activities.

To further explain my reasoning, all people have families, and with these families comes matters and other issues that need to be dealt with. For example, if a family member in this students' life happens to pass away, is the school going to tell this child to get over it and come do their activity? Or say these parents dont pay for some sort of child care system and they give this responsibility to the eldest child, are the schools going to punish these children because have to take care of their younger sibling? From slight examination, this doesn't look to good for the schools.

If the schools are going implement this mandatory rule, how will they make it so all kids can participate? This leads to my next statement,

Will the schools provide transportation to the students who may need it?

Speaking on personal experience it can be difficult for students to get a ride home after activities when their only source of transportation is their guardians who may be unable to pick them up for reasons such as working, inability to drive, and many reasons which would make it near impossible for the child to get home. Also it can be quite embarrassing to ask for a ride home everyday. This can also lead to another major problem, kidnapping, the schools may be unaware as to whom the child is going home with and that can lead to a serious problem and a possible lawsuit on the schools hands. Furthermore, if the school are serious about this plan then they will be responsible for making sure every child is safe and has a stable way of getting home.

To continue on the topic of schools providing, lets talk about financial issues for the students and the schools as well. Not only will the schools have to give up an exponential amount of money to provide resources fro these activities, the students will too. More often than not, the guardians of these students have to give up a good amount of money in order to participate in this activities, and often times the schools forget that not everyone has the same amount of financial stability. This can lead to the student feeling left out when their classmates have stuff they nay not be able to afford, or in other instances, bullying. In order for each student to feel included the schools will have to pay for all of the resources.

All of the previous points may sound bad, but this upcoming one should persuade you on its own. From family matters to financial issues nothing really compares to what could be happening to these young people if they are forced to do these activities. While these activities may be fun, each child has to eventually go home to complete any school work. With this gargantuan load of waking up early in the morning, attending school for eight hours each day, going to their activity, and then going home to do more school work can induce an amount of stress no one under the age of 20 should ever endure. While reading this you may be wondering about the students who voluntarily do these activities, they choose to participate in this and they can better plan out their schedule and balance their work. However if this idea is put into action these students won't have much of a choice.

When you are given a good chunk of the facts, do you really want your child to have to worry about being kidnapped, being excluded by their classmates, or endure an unnessasary amount of stress at a very young age? Do you want your child to be unable to focus in class because of the large work load that's being dumped on them? If not, it is your responsibility to tell your school districts that you don't think this is best for your child, and they should be able to live as a child.

In conclusion no child should have to worry about juggling these tasks nor should they be worried about going missing, being bullied, or any stress that can mess with their mental health or their performance on school. This is why you should say no to involuntary activities placed by the schools.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Most people find that you can benefit from extra curricular activities. We should all do at least one because participating in extra curricular activities can help you make long lasting friendships, they can give you something to do, and you can find things you love to do.

Participating in extra curricular activities can help you make long lasting friendships. I found my best friend in an art class after school, she now lives in Generic_City and we are closer then ever. I didnt want to go at first but once I found her, it was the only place I wanted to be. I am currently in the school play and I've found so many people that share my interests. I have also made so many new friends and now we do stuff outside of school.

Being in an extra curricular activity can also give you something to do. Before I started them all I would do is sit at home alone being bored, now I have something to do. Even when I'm not there I still do stuff for it, and instead of being bored and alone I can talk to people who are also in my extra curricular's.

When you are in an extra curricular activity you can find things you really love to do. Before I was in any extra curricular's I didnt know I could paint, sing or do anything, I thought i was just a normal boring person. When my mom made me join an art class I realized that loved to paint, and when the summer Olympics of 2012 came on I watched the gymnastics portion and realized I wanted to do that, so I took gymnastics. I'm still taking gymnastics right now. I also found out that I loved theater, I joined a play because of my friend and it turns out that it wasn't so difficult after all.

In conclusion we should all do at least one extra curricular activity. You may find some new friends, something to do, and find something you love. So next time you hear those cracks, sizzles, and pops go check it out.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A2311DAD8D62,"Did you know when you are having fun your mind is focused on what you are doing and nothing else. Yes, I think kids should get into sports/activities because they can make new friends, have fun, and it can take their minds off of things. It might be time consuming and stressful but if you are having fun that's all that matters. You also don't want to regret not doing any extra activities in the future so I would advise students to get more involved if they would like.

Kids should get more involved so they can make new friends. If they are going to play a sport their teamwork can start to increase if they are making new friends weather they like them or not it makes you feel better inside about yourself and if your coach were to see he/she would be so proud and might talk to you about it. If you make friends along the year with them then you guys can hangout outside of practice/activities. They can also practice with you and help you out to. If you don't really like them its your choice if you hangout with them or not but once you get to know them better it is always good. Overall it is always better having someone by your side then having no one.

Activities are always fun if you make it out to be. It is only boring if you make it seem that way, so if you actually get into the activity and act like your having fun then maybe it will be. It is always about having fun so if your not having fun then theirs no point but if you put a smile on your face and try with your friends than you will have a great time. If you wanted to excersize but never have the time or don't feel like doing it, you can do it in your sport because most likely they will make you run,stretch, or make you do some type of excersize before or after games/practices. It may be stressful at first but you have to fake it till you make it. If your making the most out of it and having a blast that's all that really matters.

When I did cheer my mind was only focused on that and nothing else around me. I was not stressed because I was only paying attention on cheer but if you take your mind somewhere else and think about how much homework you have to do or if you have to clean your room before your parents see that will be what is making you stress out. Before you think about that you have to think about what is happening now in the present tense not past or future because you can think/do that when the time comes. While your playing a sport that should be the only thing that is in your head at the moment. Everything is only hard if you think about it for an example if you like someone and think it will be akward talking to them it will only be if you make it that way. Same as in stress it's what you control if you are going to make it stressful or not.

It could take up some of your time but it is worth it in the end. If you are having fun,making friends, and nothing is stressing you out than I say go for it and try-out for the team, or helpout teachers, or get into a club whatever makes you happy at the end of the day. This is why I think kids in school should get involved without their being any stress, making friends, and having fun.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

After school activities are often a thing of life for kids. Most parents put their children in after school activities so that the child can grow and have productive things to do. As well as so that the child can learn to accept defeat and cooperate with other people. So if the principle thinks that he should have all kids commit to some after school activity I would support him, so that the children of this school could gain valuable life skills, keep out of trouble, and grow physically and mentally.

Extracurricular activities help students by helping them to grow physically and mentally. For example when you play sports you condition your body physically. As well when you do a mathematical or core subject related activity you grow mentally. And finally when you are on the debate team, or yearbook comity, or even the student council you often grow mentally. This is one of the ways doing after school activities can help kids, but it can also helps children in other ways.

Doing after school activities can keep children out of trouble, and they can help children by giving them something productive to do. Families dont always have a ton of money, and this can cause some families to live in a bad part of town, and that is not what we want for our children so putting these children in after school activities can help keep them out of trouble. As well some children do not have good home lives, and after school activities can often help with this, by keeping them out of that situation as long as possible, and eventually the child might feel comfortable telling a coach or teacher about this who can help that child. Adding to that a lot of children have nothing to do when they get home and will spend hours playing video games or checking social media, and putting them in a extracurricular activities can help balance the time they spend on those devices. So now you some of the ways afterschool activities can help keep students out of trouble, and help them be productive, but there are more ways that after school activities are good for children.

Doing after school activities can also help children build valuable skill that can be used when he or she becomes a adult. Children doing these activities lose one time or another while doing them, and this can teach the child about losing gracefully, and that it is OK to lose. As well in extracurricular activities a child will often be faced with problems and solving them will help the child build good problem solving skills that can be used later in life. To add to that when you do just about any after school activity you have to work in a team to do something, and this will help children build valuable team work skills that he or she will need in just about any profession. These are the reasons why I think that every child should commit do doing at least one after school activity.

There are many reasons why doing after school activities are good. Like the fact that they build good life skills. As well as that extracurricular activities give children something productive to do. And finally they help children grow physically and mentally. So for these reasons I agree that all children should be required to do after school activities.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
44E7D4E2BDE4,"Have you ever participated in a extracurricular activity before and though it was a pain to deal with? Well, your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be in school or outside of school like sports or book club. I disagree with having to do a activity, for students could have plans with others or family outside of school, they could have something wrong with them or something wrong is happening that they aren't able to participate in their activity, or a student may have a job outside of school.

To being with, having to do one extracurricular activity would be terrible if a student had planned to do something before hand. Lets say you had plans to go out with a group of friends to have ice cream,and since your principal has made everyone do an activity you went with softball or some kind of sport. Your team has practice the same day you made plans with your friends and now you have to choose between the two, your friends or practice for the big game coming up. Having to do a extracurricular activity would be unfair for that simple reason.

Next, a student could have something wrong with them or something wrong is happening to them that could prevent them from doing the activity poorly or preventing them from doing it all. For example, your friend has just got a medical cast for his leg since he hurt himself on accident playing around. He signed up for soccer since he must do an activity and there is a big game coming up and he needs to be there for his team. He is unable to play currently due to his medical cast stopping him. He is upset and cannot play soccer for his team and friends.

Then, a student could have a job to do outside of school and their activity is messing up their hours or the job. they could get fired or lose money due to the extracurricular activity they are forced to do. For example, Generic_Name has a job at the local supermarket and she starts work at four. She has also signed up for art club which starts at four every other day. Due to the activity starting as soon as her work starts she has to miss work or the activity and she will get in trouble any way she chooses because they both start at the same time.

In conclusion, I disagree with having to do a extracurricular activity because it could mess up plans with others or yourself, it could be hard doing the activity due to something wrong with a student and it could ruin peoples day with the schedule of the activity.     ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Not everyone likes sports a lot of students might be good at taking pictures ,they can help with the year book and that's a good way to learn more about pictures and the skills and even what you can improve on. If your a person that loves school and care about it a lot you can the serve on the students council it's a really nice job, you get to help your school out and you might even get an award for taking the time out your day to help your school for instants the liberty you would help with the books or when we have things like the

Can Food Drive where you take food for kids in need.

Being involve more also help mental heath,being around people outside more instead of inside all the time doing nothing but on your phone or just eating. Also it's a great way to keep your grades up because if your in a activity you enjoy and your grades are falling you are going to want to work harder so your grades can stay up and you can remain in that activity. And the fun part is you get to meet new people that are into the same things as you so that's a win win. It's normally if you have a B or a A you can go on trips with the people in the activity you picked so you would be having good grades all the time.

I agree because it's a great way to keep your grades up, meet new people and also give you a good image if you are nice and not disrespectful. You can even get into a collage if you do join a activiy so why no just do it.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

Many students enjoy extracurricular activities, such as a sport, band, or yearbook. I believe that all students should participate in an activity that interests them because you have the opportunity to meet new people, enjoy new experiences, and have the chance to prepare for the future.

Choosing one of these activities can lead to life long friends that share the same interests. You can meet new people who are just as passionate about an activity as you are. I joined yearbook and met many people who had a love for writing and journalism just as I do. You can discover who you want to be surrounded by in your life by finding different people through these activities. You find people who are working towards the same goal as you are, and you can help each other along the way.

New experiences are another benefit you receive from joining and extracurricular class. You have the once in a lifetime chance to experience these new activities. You can see what you are good at and what you enjoy, which could lead to a career in the future. If you join cross country you may find that you love the feeling of the wind against your face. If you join yearbook you may discover that you have a passion for journalism. You can perfect a skill that you have always had an interest for or you might find that you have a passion for something that you never thought of before.

Participating in an extracurricular class will help you prepare for adulthood. You will have to learn how to balance your time between education, relationships with family and friends, chores, and the activity you choose. In fifth grade I joined soccer, at that time homework was new to me, so I had to learn to balance chores, homework, and soccer. I benefited from this experience greatly, because when the middle school approached I had already learned how to balance my time, which made the transition easier. This will prepare you for college and everything after. Learning how to balance everything in your life is a skill necessary for when you become an adult. It is better to learn these skills when you are of a young age than having to learn it in the middle of a chaotic life in the future.

In conclusion, joining these activities offers many benefits. You will spend less time on electronics, which is healthy for the minds of all ages. You can exercise your mind by learning new skills and meeting different people.

I believe that all students should join an extracurricular activity because you can meet different people, and enjoy many new experiences while preparing for your adult life. Although it can be frightening to try new things, it will benefit you in abundant ways.

I find I live a much happier life when I am doing something I love, even though it may frighten me, than when I am playing it safe by never trying anything new. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Extracurricular programs are more school work and/or more time that students have to spend at school. Not many students want that. Students should not have to participate in extracurriculars because they might not have enough time, they will have no intrest in something they don't want to do and most students don't want that extra work. I know that most students don't want to do extracuricular activities and for the ones that do they will take them i nthe first place.

The first reason I think students should not have to take extracurricular activites is because a lot of them won't have time. It's that simple. After school, rather than going to some club or activity that they don't want to take in the first place, they may have sports practice or homework and studying to do. Whatever the student has after school is probabaly more important than the extracurricular activity that they are forced to take. For the activities that are in school, there will still be work to get done out of school as well. As a student I know that having too much can be very stressful.

The second reason I think students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities is they will have a lack of intrest. Most students won't want to take the program so they won't try while taking it. It will be hard for whoever is running the program to teach, especially if it's not a grade and no one cares about it. On top of all that it will be a waste of time for both the students and the teacher and they just won't want to be there.

Finally, while the students aren't enjoying the extracurricular activity they will be rushing to get their work finished just get out that class or go home. The students are also likely to have an atitude and be rude to the instructor. Abviously the instructor won't like this and they too won't want to be running this program but he/she may be at force to run it like the students are to take it.

The three main reasons why students should not have to do extracurricular activites are not enough spare time for students, lack of intrest in program they are taking and students need free time time away from school rather than more work. Any school that makes students participate in extracurricular activites are just being cruel and mean to their students! It's extra curricular and not required curricular.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
C1D9A969B6B6,"What do you do with your time? This year our principal has decided that we all have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. When making this decision the principal didn't hesitate to present her students with a amount of activities they can participate in. So many options include things like participation in any sport, effort on the yearbook, and even just serving on the student council. Deciding that all students have to participate in a extracurricular activity can spark a new interest and can turn into a good tool for improving time management.

A range of interests are found out each day, each sparking in different type of people. Sports, reading, crafts are some of many interests students like to participate in. Many students try to find what their good and what they enjoy. Some don't, a good amount of students don't exactly know what there going to do in the future, many haven't given it a thought. This new rule can spark many new interests to people who expect it the least. You never know if you like it or not if you haven't tried it. This a way many students can find things they would of never tried and advance on doing it all while they enjoy themselves. New hobbies are made and student makes the expectation of the new rule.

Some you are know stranger to procrastination. Procrastination is a form of holding off important things to the very last minute. Phones. Phones have been a big staple in people's efforts and time. Nine out of ten teens have some social media installed on their devices. This whole generation revolves around our prized possession, our phones. When scrolling, tapping, or even watching funny videos time flies. As I was saying earlier this new rule may cause some new interests to spark up. A student may find a interest they want to continue. Now the student can balance their time with an equal portion on every part of their day. A balanced day, if you will.

At the start if this essay I explained how students could benefit from this rule. Overtime a student many not only find his or her interests but improve a use of their time management skills. Your body needs to get a certain amount of vitamins and foods to function. The same way a student could process better information and do even better in school when their mind ins't always thinking about one certain thing. Broading the minds idea of things could help with time management and the future glide of what the later do in life. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
DEB6DD3E13D8,"Yes I agree with the principal. I agreed because students need to have at least 30 minuets out side. Students should also be a part of an activity in there school because it is very fun. The principal said that you have to at least do one activity. It is good for you if you stay after school to do activities like sports or work on the year book you can also work on your homework if you need help. It is good for you because you get to learn new things about your school and also can represent your school you can also stay in shape.

Most of the students in the school dont do any thing because they are to lazy or they have to take care of there siblings. For example when I was in fifth grade I had two activates that I did an they were basketball and there was a club named on my road and we did our homework and when we were done we go out side and play sports and each day we had a different sport. I had a lot of fun when I was doing actives after school because I got to get away from my sisters and my mom because my mom always cleans and it annoys me because right when I get back from school my mom says go clean your room, clean the living room, go clean the bathroom and when I am done I barely had time to do my homework.

Some activities can help you in the future because you can get to go to college for free if you are good student and have good grades and know how to play a sport. In my opinion it is very fun to do a sport because you get to meet new people and even get better at sports and get to compete against other schools. That is why I think that students should do activities after school.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
54489E26F9F5,"Dear students,our dear principal had decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. And frankly I couldnt agree more. The students in our school are paying to much on their phones .All students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they teach you like skills,They help people get people of their phones.

The first reason all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is that they teach you life skills you need to know. For example If you want to join a sport extracurricular activity i'll us soccer as an example. It teaches you a life skill called team work. In a game you must pass the ball to your teammates and they must also do the same. It is impossible to win a game without working together with your teammates. Let me show you another example with the student council extracurricular activity. It teaches you about different roles you might have and the responsibilities they come with. If your the president you must be responsible and check up on all the other people in the council.

The last reason all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is that it gets them off their phones and communicating with other people. This day and age kids would rather be on social media and playing on their phones then be involved in an extracurricular activity and talking to other people. But if all students had to participate in an extracurricular activity then they would have communicate with other people. Communication is very important and the student council extracurricular activity could help people who have troubling communicating . Because the whole point of that extracurricular activity is to communicate and fix problems pertaining to the school.

To summarize, all students should participate in an extracurricular activity. They are good for student to learn life skills they need for their future. They are also a good way for students to get off from their phones and communicate with other students in our school. If students were required to take an extracurricular activity it would help our school.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
B38DBE0AD1B2,"Imagine you are sitting down in a middle school classroom, all of a sudden your principle patches in on the intercom he says attention all 8th grade students, you are now required to participate in at least one after school extra curricular activity. Your mind races you think of all the things you could do, you think of chess club or the football team. That is what happened to me and if I am being honest i think it is a good idea, to have students participate in something and not just sit around, i think it is a good idea because it keeps students healthy and active.

There are many sports, I even play play a few myself such as baseball, swim team and football. if not a sport than a student can join a club such as decorating a yearbook or or act as a member on a student council which is very important if a student wanted to pursue a career in the government.

activities such as these are very important for brain development and creating social skills. even if you despise doing activities such as these there are so many options they are also very good for making friends, some of my closest friends i have met through base ball or swim team.

But i understand how some people can not like these things they could have social anxieties or maybe they are not good at sports i understand but having them be required to do such a thing i think is good. giving people an excuse to go outside and actually do something like hangout with friends or be an active member of the community is awesome and more people should do that. or just act in there school as someone who dose something for the community.

That is why people should do things like play sports or help out in their community is it look good on your resume for colleges and con help you if you need references for jobs in the future that is one of the many reasons i agree and i think you should to because even if you dont like sports or clubs or thing like that they are still very important.

That is why think it is so important so if the school besides to implement this change i would support it and encourage you to do the same. it is a good way to make friends it looks good to collages and there are so many other good things about it and i think it is better to the alternative which is just doing nothing and so that is what i think about the topic.                   ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
61343B6C7E0B,"I highly disagree with the principle's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Most extracurricular activities are after school, since during school hours you're learning. Also, it's pretty unfair to force someone into doing something they're not so comfortable doing. Here are some reasons why I chose to not agree with the decision the principle is making.

For one, some kids get bullied enough during school, why should they stay after just so they can get bullied even more throughout the day? Not all teachers see or hear a kid being bullied, or when an individual bullies another. Which leads to it occuring more frequently. That damages a persons mental health. Being bullied will cause a person to degrade themselves, the person being bullied may even start to bully others, and it could cause the person being bullied to develope some sort of depression. Being bullied is one of the leading causes to suicide. When an individual has depression, it makes them tired or weak. Causing them to lose focus and forget about the work they're doing in class or maybe even lose interest in trying. Then, they'll have all this work piled up, have to stay after school to play a sport or help out with the yearbook, which will put stress onto them, and that's not a good thing. When people get stressed out, they could get sick or have heart failure from their blood pressure getting raised to a certain extent.

Another reason is that, a lot of kids struggle financially. Some people might not have a way of transportation from school to home. Most parents work throughout the day while their child is at school. People have to make money, and some jobs won't just let you leave. A lot of kid's parents may get off work around 4 or 6pm, but what about the one's that don't get off work until 8 or 9pm? Yes, the school provides transportation with buses, but they only go through certain routes. If your location isn't near your buses route, then they drop you off at a local gas station or store. But, what if you aren't fortunate enough to have a family member come pick you up and bring you home? Some people aren't as lucky.

I can see it now, people will start skipping school if the principle doesn't give them the choice whether they want to stay after school or not. I'm pretty positive that a lot of parents might make the decision of putting their child into homeschooling or choose to put them in a private school, only to do what's best for them and their child. Students willl tend to be more rebellious, just to skip their extracurricular activity or get kicked out of it. Making it to where there's more people who will be in ISS, more distractions in class, making it to where we can't do our work, and the teachers will be piled with stress due to their students rebelling against them. It'll give the school a bad name because of the number of kids getting in trouble, making the school look really bad. Most kids don't even like attending school, what makes you think they will want to stay after for a couple more hours?

However, I do believe there are better solutions into getting kids to participate in extracurricular activities. Teachers could try to motivate kids, you could find some well known influencers to try to influence the student body, and also, there is the solution of giving them a choice. I still believe it would be a bad decision to force people into staying after school. I'm aware they have a choice in what activities they could do, but forcing them to pick something isn't okay. Think of what the students want, think of what's best for them. If you tried to motivate the youth, they would be much more easier to cooperate with. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
9EB7C8500032,"We all like our free time, right? You would probably be quite upset if you lost a sizable chunk of it. Well, that thought is becoming a striking reality as one of the principal's newest rules seeks to take that exactly that away from us students. He has decided that all students must participate in at least one after-school activity, be it sports, a club, or the council. But this decision is a horrible one! This is an attack on our free time, and should be stopped before it can take root. An idea such as this could have serious consequences on everyone it affects. For example, it hurts our freedom and schedules harshly, it attacks our precious family bonds, and it could even raise crime rates!

Freedom is a very important part of our country. At many points in history, we have fought for it, and not just for our's, but for other country's freedom's as well. It has defined us ever since we gained our own, so why do children get theirs attacked by schools? Schools already limit free time by about six hours, for five days a week. But now the principal is trying to take that number even higher! Students need their free time, it's important to do homework, review what they've learned, or just unwind. But not all of us already have that luxury. Many students already have things to do right after school, like a non-school sports team, an instrument, or some kind of appointment or job that they do. If they have to do something for the school instead of doing what they have planned, it could hurt their motivations and dreams.

Family is undoubtedly one of the most important things in anyone's lives. They raise us from babies, teach us morals and manners, and support us, even when we're old. The bonds that hold a family together are irreplaceable and therefore, very valuable. That is why it is critical to reinforce these bonds, and not weaken them, yet the new school decree may do just that. One of the best ways to bond is to spend time together. But not spending time with each other may have the opposite effect, in weakening bonds. If an already weakened bond is stretched too thin, it may snap, leaving the bond's holders feeling unwanted in the other's company. The principal's ruling could harshly affect your family, and if it's at a bad time, permanently damage it.

Crime, a thing every non-criminal dislikes. There are many kinds, but are all committed by humans who have chosen to ignore the laws. But healthy adults usually don't randomly become criminals for no reason. Crime breaking as an adult usually evolves from rule breaking as a child or some other kind of influence or trauma. If a child sees a rule as pointless, there is a very high chance for them to ignore it completely, and this can rapidly advance to them breaking lots of rules. A rule that could seem very pointless or unimportant is the new one, about extra-curricular activities. If a child starts not showing up for after school things, in the child's mind it could easily transition to not going to school for days, or even weeks! That is why rules are usually made with careful thought so they are important, and not easily shrugged off that they are pointless or not worth following. This new rule could have an unforeseen consequence of creating more rule breakers, and therefore, possible criminals.

School rules are important. They stop us from running wild and doing whatever we want not reprimanded. But when a rule affects a child adversely in many different ways, it is usually best that the rule is revoked, or at least given more thought. Rules that limit freedom are a tense subject, as at what point does it become too many limits? Limiting freedom in school is accepted and understandable, but when school ends, it should be up to us or our parents to decide what we do, not the school. For parents, this could cause a lot of stress, as it can interfere with lots of schedules. For example, a child could come home after school to watch his baby sibling, or do some kind of important chore. But now, parents have to fit their schedules around this new ordinance, and that is unfair to both the parents and the children it affects. Rules in general are very important. They are what keeps our society together, and stops people from doing just whatever they want. But this new school rule is a bad idea. It not only limits our freedom, it could hurt our family bonds, and could even eventually create criminals.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
129391F5ECBF,"Do you think it is important to have school clubs? because a lot of people like it and dislike it. At Generic_School they are having a vote for should they have clubs or they should not. Do you think it is important to have one well I do and here are the reasons.

You can make new friends! This is a big one because some people dont know how to get friends. This is a good way because if you join a club that has the same in tress! Evidence shows that at Shepherd university said that students have made more friends through clubs or something outside of school. A other study at Shepherd shows that that are in clubs have more friends than kids in no club.

Clubs can make you relaxed and more happy about your self. At Boston collage they have found kids in clubs are more relaxed than kids in no club. Dr. Newman said ""When I went there the kids were relaxed and happy, Then when I went to a other school with no clubs they seemed stressed"". Boston collage also studied that kid that have a higher self a steam will do better in school.""The kids that are more happy will get better grades and the kids that arent as happy will get lower grades"". said Dr. Newman. He also said ""That is not the case all the time"".

There are a lot of types of clubs to! ""At Generic_School there are tons of clubs"". Said Generic_Name the principle for the school. There is RC club, foursquare club, book club, snake club, and many others! Generic_Name said ""There are clubs for every student!"" So it seems like you can have a club for everyone! This helps students relax and have lots of fun with your friends. ""Generic_School has been doing this for years, Also the students think it is great!"" said Generic_Name.

But what if the kids are behind on work is there a club for that? And what if a kid does not like to be in a club so what are they going to do? At Florida state university a studie has shown that some kids use the clubs to go to the bathroom and just stay in there the hole time. This can make the kids have bad habets. So the kids that are behind on work will just have to wait till they get home. What happens if the kid does not have a good house hold and he cant get his work done because of it.

Well thats why they have the homework club. you can do any work you can in there! Like math, science, english, civics, art, and many others! At Generic_School a kid named Generic_Name said ""I get all my work done in there and when were done we read or study for a test! The kids that dont want to do a club will still get to pick a club but they will chose homework mostof the time.

In the end it seems like clubs are a great thing and they help out with students health! They also seem to be more happy and relaxed. The kids in the homework club like it because they can get help from multible teachers. Do you think it is important to have one well I do and here are the reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
18D33D605574,"I think they shouldn't because kids won't have any time to play or they won't have any time to do there homework. It will make school even worst. And when you get home you won't feel like doing any homework.

Think they should do the people that want to stay they can stay but the people that want to go home they can. I think the idea would help but not everybody has to stay. They should do the people that are doing bad tell them to stay after so they can get extra help. That way when they get to school they will already know what to do. That way when they have a test those students will be ready to get a good grade.

I also think they shouldn't because of the buses they should be at home not still picking up kids. They should not be working in the afternoon because that when everybody that works come home. They work so hard driving us home every day then they have to wake up the next morning and do it again. I don't think they get paid that much and they drive us every day. And the teachers that stay after school with us I don't even think they get paid that much and they stay after school just to help us so we can graduate.

It would help us in somemany ways but is it good for the staff. I think the janaders work here longer then anybody. And they do there best to clean the school. I think if work here that long I think they should get paid more. They don't leave the school until every thing is clean.

I don't like after school because of the work but I have stay in order to pass but I don't think everybody should praticipate in after school. And the schools need to start paying the teachers that stay after more for staying after.

I wouldn't have to stay if I had got my work done.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
CA14AD55CFF2,"The principal's proposal has its benefits, but it could also lead to a number of problems. Kids go to school everyday for a number of hours, working away to meet their academic goals. They are then sent home with numbers upon numbers of worksheets, math problems, study guides, essays, and other homework items. While some kids are used to dividing their time for school and extracurricular activities like sports or clubs, others are not. Making after school activities a requirement will take a toll on a lot of student's after school lives for the following reasons.

Of course, their are age limits and requirements for driving. So, when kids are able to transport themselves to their activities, they look to their parents for a lift. Since parents are busy caring for their families, most go to work or work from home to earn money. Different jobs have different time frames so adding a mandatory activity to some families schedules could interfere with parent's work. A lot of parents get home late from work, meaning kids could have no way to get to their activity before then. If a child cannot get to their activity due to lack of transportation, there is an obvious problem, which will be hard to solve without complicating other family member's plans.

Another possible issue is lack of interest in the available extracurricular activities. There are only a number of activities a kid can sign up for and do in their area, so what happens if none of them spark an interest? Children are sent to school for a majority of the day, doing their school work, which most students don't seem to enjoy. Having them sign up for an activity they don't really like could turn what is supposed to be fun into a chore. Kids would be dragging on through the day, from one boring thing to the next, as they watch the clock until they are sent home. A lot of children are most likely going to be tired after hours of work at school, so requiring each of them to get home, with possibly little to no time to rest before getting ready for an activity they don't want to do could do damage on the child's mental and physical strength.

A sensitive topic to some families is money. Schools and peers never know how a family is doing with financial stability. While some families could spend with little worries on savings, others could be living their lives paycheck to paycheck, with just enough money to send their children to school, pay for a house and put food on the table. Sometimes, the current situation a family is in limits their ability to spend, and extracurricular activities often cost money. Whether the costs are on gear, supplies, or even gas for transportation to these events, some families simply cannot earn the money to pay for these things. Nobody deserves to feel pressured due to this new school rule. Adding this requirement could urge parents to have to work another job, or limit spending on other needs like food or a house to pay for whatever is needed for a child's activity. If there is absolutely no way for a family to pay for a sport, club, etc, having the school or the child's friends find out they cannot pay could lead to feelings of embarrassment and sometimes jealousy of people with more money.

Adding after school activities as a requirement could help kids get out more, exercise, and other benefits, but the bad outweighs the good. I believe families should not feel pressured to change their lives so their kids could go to their activity. Students must balance school work on top of possible family issues and other things, so if families can take them to an after school activity, then that's great, but if they can't then they shouldn't be forced to. Transportation, lack of interest, and money are just some possible issues with the principals new idea, along with others, like stress, possible injuries, etc. Schools should stick to educating our future adults, and leave the rest to the families of the children.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
06621D81324A,"Like the principal stated, it should be mandatory for students, at any every age, to take at least one, if not more, extracurricular activity and here's why.

Students are growing, no matter if you're in kindergarten or a senior in high school, you are always growing both physically and mentally. As you grow, a lot begins to change in the world around you and extracurricular activities can help you adapt to these new changes. Your health is very important as you grow and maintaining and getting into good shape is vital to a students well being. Extracurricular activities such as conditioning, basketball, football, track, lacrosse, and other sports get you into good shape and keep you healthy. Other activities such as Shop and Home EC. teach you the necessities to life that you might not learn from anyone else. Learning to sew and cook, as well as build and repair objects, are incredibly important, especially when you buy a house, get a job, and have a family of your own.

Some activities such as Chess Club and D&D Club creates a new mentality and way of thinking, allowing you to learn tactics and strategy in not only the game but also the ability to attack and solve problems in the real world at different angles. Journalism improves your writing skills as you create, edit, and re-edit your article. Journalism let's you traverse the schools grounds in search of a good story or the perfect interview to not only entertain your readers and fellow students, but also to keep them posted on current events and state of the all the things happening around them in school and it's community. Working on the yearbook immerses you into the schools community, lets you make new friendships, and create cherished memories for students and teachers to look back on for the rest of time. Such things as Homework Club let you get a jump start on homework so you can spend more time with friends and family as well as increasing the time you get to do the things you love. Math Counts and Science Olympiad keeps your brain in peak performance as you review and practice, but also learn and constantly improve your intellect and stretch your brain. Other activities, such as Debate, let you sharpen your wit, improve your ability to speak in front of an audience , advance one's argument skills, compromising skills, and working with your team to find good evidence and construct the best argument possible to defeat the opposing viewpoint.

As much as these activities offer, one of the most important and crucial to students everywhere is the social experience and friends you gain. No matter what activity you participate in, you are always working with or against someone. These experiences can bring people close and let you make new friends with people you'd never met before. These people can become some of your best friends because the fact that they take that activity with you means that they probably share at least one interest with the you. I have experience with this effect myself. I live in a place where the district border of Generic_School and Generic_School, and Generic_School and Generic_School basically goes through my house. When the end of sixth grade rolled around and it was time to move on to Middle school I had a really hard time leaving. Because of this divide with the border, all the friends I had known for seven years (including kindergarten) went to Generic_School while I went to Generic_School. I had horrible anxiety and depression moving away from them, knowing I may never see some of them again and going to school that I was criminally under prepared for. Well as it turns out, my parents were much more prepared for this than I was. Years before they had signed me up for Generic_School sports instead of Generic_City sports (what all my friends did). Because I played on Generic_School lacrosse teams, basketball teams, and swim teams, I got to make a whole lot of friends from my teammates and even Generic_School athletes I had competed against. This made the transition from a place where I had spent seven years of my life with friends I had known more than half my life, to a place that I knew nothing about and barely anyone to talk to, a breeze. It was still hard to say good bye to my friends and I still didn't know many people, but the friends I had made from those sports and the new friends I made from things like D&D Club and Homework Club made middle school a fun and welcoming place.

Extracurricular activities offer a lot of learning, reviewing, improvement, health benefits, social skills, organization, feelings of pride and accomplishment, helping other students, and jump start on homework, but also so much more. These activities create cherished memories and life long friends. They help you find parts of you and interests you never even knew you had. They help you find yourself and find others to help you strive along the journey of life and overcome it's most challenging obsticals.

In retrospect, these activities offer so much more then what meets the eye and that's why it should be mandatory for every student at every age, to take at least one or more extracurricular activity.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
AC9EA64819DC,"Do you always come home from school with so much to get done? Well what if you had no choice but to participate in a extracurricular activity. That would'nt be fair right. As an eighth grader in middle school, having a lot of homework, working on projects, and studying is already a lot, and adding a sport to that would be more stressful. We all can relate to being stressed and pressured. Which is why I disagree that students must participate in a extracurricular activity because, it can be stressful on some students, students have other activities outside of school, and lastly students should be able to make their own choices.

Some students come home with so much work that needs to get done, and that alone can be very stressful. Now imagine what some students would have to go through if they had to join a sport or student council. Its too much for some students to handle at a young age. Making it a must to participate in a extracurricular activity, with students who are in honors or AP classes is a lot of stress for them, considering all the homework and studying they have. All that stress could lead to sleeping problems or worse, which could interfere with a students performance at school.

Not all students have the time to stay after school. Many students may have other activities outside of school, that can already be tough on them. Students might already have a sport they play outside of school they need to attend. Every team depends on their teammates, and if they have to participate in an extracurricular activity in school, it would effect them and their team. Some students may also have community service, or a church program they might have to attend. participating in a extracurricular activity would effect their everyday after school activities would be effected.

As students we should be able to make our own choices. It would'nt be fair to us if we did'nt have a choice. As we are getting older our choices in school should matter. they should'nt take that privilege away from us as students. If we want to join a sport, it should be the students choice. If we want to serve on the student council, it should be the students choice. They should'nt have to if they don't want to, or have the time to.

In summary, I disagree with students having no choice but to participate in extracurricular activities. It would be stressful on some students, many students have activities outside of school, and students should be able to make their own choices. Some students have busy lives, and other complicated things they go through after and during school. Its a lot for students and if they can't fit anything else in their schedule they should'nt have to. As students participating in an extracurricular activities should be a choice, not a must.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
66F7AD6B99E2,"I should agree because it can make your grades higher by joining sports, after school subjects or classes, and it make you more smarter and more. In my school we join sports and some after school classes and if we join some sports or some activities after school we have credits and it add up to your grades and people doesn't want to participate because they're lazy and sometimes they make up stories that the have headache, sick, stomach ache, and just skipping after school classes. And sometimes they fail some classes and teachers wants to convince them to join and stay after class and make their grades up.

I have a friend that is a bit of a trouble in school his name is Generic_Name he ask me if I could help him do his work and I said to him that "" You can join activity classes at social studies, or stay after school, and it makes your grades high and you can learn something "" And he didn't followed me, and thats why he still have one F on Social Studies.

If I was the principal I would make every students join sports and make them stay after school for those school activities, and if they have like an F in one class or a missing assignment I would call their parents and ask the parents if their child can stay after class and make their bad grades or missing assignment gone and make their grades higher and get extra credits for participating for after school activities.

And if I was the student I can convince them by letting students know if they have problems on their work or missing assignments I would let them convince to join the after school activities or stay after to do some retakes on their test or quizzes and figure out what is wrong with their grades and fix them and make their grades high. And those who doesn't want to join the after school activities will remain have an F for the 2nd quarter.

The best thing is for the students who want to try or join the team for basketball, tennis, badminton, baseball, hockey, and wrestling is the best thing because few students always wants to join or try for the team. And my two friends join for basketball and hockey my one friend named Generic_Name wants to try out for baseball this spring season and he is really good at basketball and baseball, but the only wrong for him is he has bad grades. I know that students should have good grades before you try out for the team. Generic_Name made a decision to stay after class and do the retakes and after 3 weeks Generic_Name has good grades and he try out for baseball and made the team.\

I agree that students should participate to after school classes or sports. Even me I stayed after school just to finish my work or do some retakes and get a better grade this year. Before I also don't want to go to after school classes, but when I got a really bad grades I started to go to a after school classes and finish work and do retakes and here I got some good grades.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

At our school they will work hard, thats why we believe that students should have an extracurricular activity.

If we add an extracurricular activity your child will gain more work experience. So when they start to work the students will have some kind of idea how hard it's going to be. And if we add an activity they will be ready to work harder. Also it can teach students to work at home too they will help you.

It can also affect there grades will go up too as they realize how it's going to be. They will start to try harder and do there very best so when college comes they will already have work experience.

and they will be prepared for the work they get, to work hard on it.

Besideses who said the activity is boring. It can also be fun we will have a verity of choices for the students to choose from. And it will help students be more active it is fun. It will also increase students particpation in more classes since they been more active. So it will be enjoyed for students to come to school also they will be less boared in class. If they have somthing fun to do, it will challenge the students too. And an may help a students find a passion in one of these activity for the work force as well. This activity may also allow students to take a break and enjoy there passion like soccer, football,baseball,and basketball or drawing,reading, and writing. So they work to there goal as a person and a student.

And this may also create or improve in teamwork,creativity,leadership,independece, and critical thinking.

So this may help them learn some important traits. For the future of the planet and the future of the work force. And these traits are important for the job they want to get. Because without these traits the student won't be able to get a job that there passionate about.

8FA214DB6E8B,"What's even more boring than school? Homework? Afterschool activities? Well yes, Afterschool activities are super boring and they shouldn't have them for schools. People think that first doing school is boring enough, but doing afterschool activities is probably the WORST idea ever because you have to do even more work. I believe that we shouldn't have afterschool activities because it makes things even worse than usual.

One reason why schools shouldn't have afterschool activities, is because it's is extremely exhausting. As I was walking out to do bus duty, I heard a student say, ""I have practice tonight, but I'm super tired and I want to lay down and take a nap"", says Generic_Name, 8th Grade Dean of Generic_school.

A second reason why schools shouldn't have afterschool activities is because it's a waste of time. Students have reported that they have a big MASTERY test the next day and they have to go to practice so they don't have much time to be able to study for the test the next day.

Some people argue that doing afterschool activities are actually really fun, because ""You can hang out with friends and not have to do homework right away"", says Generic_school of the Institute of National Athletics and Sports. However, doing afterschool activities is really annoying because ""people that are really tired and don't want to go to practice or their sport, and want to go lay down and take a nap on their bed"", says researcher Ethan Adams of the Institute of afterschool programs.

I believe that all schools shouldn't have afterschool activities because it's extremely exhausting, and it's a waste of time. I would think twice about signing up for afterschool activities because you might want to change your mind and then not do it. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
5DAE5C8E951C,"Imagine that all your rights are taken away and you have to work for your entire life. Forcing kids to do after school activates is like that. Students should have freedom of what they do after school,also they might already be in after school classes or they might not like the programs that they offer. Whatever the reason is students should not be forced to do any activities after school.

Students should the right to do what they want to do after school. You see if they want to go home after a long tired day at school they should go home. Forcing to participate in after school curricular actives will just increase stress and misery on the student,nothing will be accomplished from this. Students might have other things to do like chores are just talking to there relatives or some other thing that they might have in there life. Young people come here to learn that it, they have there life. School is school not a prison.

Many students go home take eat a snack and go participate in the sport or activate they already do outside of school. A decent amount of students already do extra curricular activates outside of school. Making everyone to participate a in an activity in school would be a punishment. The people who already do activities will have a major bust up in there schedule which will cause lots of problems to them. Also the students who are not in after school activities will eventually find something to do maybe in school or something to do when they get home.

Sure the school system does offer a variety of extra curricular activities so people can participate in. However out of all the programs some students might not want to join. They just might not be interested to go in the activity,or they might have tired one or two classes and they might have found apathy for it. Some kids might just want to be at home and relax so and dont work themselves too much in school or school-like activities.

Students should certainly not be forced into after school activities. There are many reasons and who knows what in whos life. It is important to not overwhelm students with these activities. Though it is important to do fun activities on your own or in a group but it is something that shouldn't be don't with pressure. Think about you do all this effort in school and you want to leave and relax,but with after school activities you can't. This is why students should always have a choice in everything and with case they should not be forced to do after school actives.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
3F249F1FCBBC,"Yes, I do agree with this decision, it is important that you are bringing yourself into the school more by doing at least one extracurricular activity. I think this is important because if you are a student at a school you should be engaged to that school in and outside of school hours. I mean one extracurricular activity is not that much to bear with, it could be really fun , you could play sports, you could do the yearbook, and you can even serve on the student council. If I were a principal at a school I would encourage this rule too because I would want kids to have fun in school not just learn and do things that are required. I would want to show the students that school is not something that you should dread, but it is something that you should take advantage of and use it everytime you can. I know that students just want to get back home right after school hours but they do not realize that they can stay after and have so much fun doing activities and bonding with other students that also are doing the activities with you. After school activities can be really fun, you can sign up for a once a year sports competition that our school does like the flag football tournament. The flag football tournament was so fun for every one of the students that signed up for it. Like I said it should not be something that you dread, it should be something that you want to do often. I know a lot of students are really upset about this new rule because they do not like doing things with other people that often, but once they start doing it and meeting students that you have never spoken to before everything starts to become fun and exciting.

Students are constantly on their phones and their games that they forget all about all the fun you could be having off phones and screens. Some students are in such a rush to finish school to go home back to their screens when they could be hanging out with their friends after school and before school. I think extracurricular activites are great opportunities to be bonding with new people and making friends. As an example, I did not have too many friends back in 7th grade but after I started going to after school activities such as weight lifting and other clubs, I have been doing a great job making friends and actually have a nice social life now. I am just saying this new rule that you have to do one extracurricular activity is going to help a lot of people that are struggling with making friends and talking to new people. After this year they are going to love our principal for deciding this for everyone. Students are going to be hanging out with their new friends that they met in after school activities and they are going to look back and wonder, what would have happened if this were never a rule. I just want kids that do not have many friends to meet new people and future friends for themselves.

I used to struggle making friends and talking to new people, but some of these extracurricular activites made me feel better about myself and less insecure. It was a lot of great experiences for me and I just want everyone that was in my position to feel the same way I do right now, that is why I am agreeing on this idea. I do not want any kids to suffer or be shy, I want them to meet new people and make friends during these extracurricular activities. I just agree with this so much because this is how you meet and bond with new people, I feel like a lot of students need one extracurricular activity. For example I know a student that is not that very social and is struggling to make new friends other than myself, I told him that he should go to some after school activities to meet other students and make new friends. The next day he went weight lifting with me and he met some new people and now he has more friends. I just want this opportunity to be taken advantage of by some students.

C822187BF7E4,"Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they could make life long friends that have the same interest. For an example, if you join a club or sport and know nothing about it, you could ask someone in that club or sport to explain and help you understand more about it. After that, you just might have a new friend.

Students could join a extracurricular activity because they need a hobby. Students who don't have any activities to do after-school should sign up for a sport or club because they could become really interested in it and keep doing that activity throughout the school year. Students should join extracurricular activities because they could be fun and it could be a new experience.

Students could join a extracurricular activity to make new friends. If you have a small friend group and want to expand, joining a club and/or sport would be a good option because there's always teamwork involved. Students could make friends just by having the same interest in a activity, subject, hobby, etc.

If the student has a job that is very time consuming and not understanding at all then they could possibly lose their job. Losing a job is very bad considering it's already extremely hard to find a job and on top of that they lose their source of income. If the student is making money to help out with bills or buying food they can't anymore because they dont have a source of income.

When students start doing extracurricular activities then they start to lose time with family and loved ones. When the students start losing time with family it can impact them mentally. If their family member is sick or is hardly home and they miss out on getting to see them, that can be very hard on that person. If the student has sibling they need to watch or take care of they can't anymore because they aren't home, having to do something else they might not even like.

Student might have family that run a business that the are required to work at. when the student has to start doing other things like sports and clubs, they won't be able to work and help out as much with the family business anymore.

I think that they shouldn't have to do a school activity,only if they want to because maybe they want to spend time with their family and friends.

First,some students like to go to the mall with their friends and spend time together. Because maybe the school they go to dont have the activities that they like,and they just want to be with their friends.

Second,they want to hangout with their friends but, also join a different activity that their school doesnt have with their friends.

Because,then they can spend time together and have fun when doing the stuff they like to do.

third,maybe the teachers dont let students talk to one another in the activities class and they like to do fun activities but its boring because, they can't enjoy as much because they can't talk to their friends.

Maybe,they do like activity but like actives outside of school so they can talk to their friends and enjoy it better then in school. And also to create bonds with their friends and to know them better then before.

Students like to spend time with their friends and enjoy actives outside of school better then the ones in school.

Also,students maybe do like the activities in school but, they want to spend more time at their house then at school.

First,some students might like to play video games because,that's what they like to do.

And because they can't play in school because you have to learn and want to have fun.

Second,they want to rest from a long day at school.

Because can be hard for some student and maybe activities will make them even more tired and they just want go home and get some rest.

To began with, learning how to team work with others is a every important skill to have but not a lot of people have it. Why should teens know team work skills because having team work skills will help them in a long way, like an example a football teams, if on one isn't lessening to no one then there team will probably lose every signal game, the reasoning is that, no one has team work skills. How can they learn team work skills, is by teaching them to understanding others and knowing others for who they are as a person because if they don't want to do it, then why should the other person do it, so teach be the one and get to know them.

Students should not be forced to do extracurricular activities because some students just don't have the time, others are not in good standing and need to focus on their school work, and all students should have the freedom to choose if they want to do extracurricular activities or not.

Some students don't have time. Students are very busy with things outside of school, some play on sports teams that are not through the school, some are busy doing things at home, and others might not have parents that have time to get them to the activities and take them back home. If students were forced to do extracurricular activities at school they would not be able to promise that they would be there. If students had to do extracurricular activities the clubs and sports teams would not be able to run properly because not everyone in them would be able to show up.

Some students are not in good standing and need to be focused on their school work. One of the things I have always been told when I am on a school sports team is that if my grades are not good I will not be able to practice or compete. If the school made every student do extracurricular activities you might be breaking their own rule if a student is failing a class. If the school wants everyone to be able to do these activities they need to make time for all students to catch up on their school work.

7FC7FFE08C80,"As a student, I think it is a great idea for kids to participate in an extracurricular activity. The reason I say this is because children need to be more active, social with people and peers, and also should take pride in their school and community. An extracurricular can help students become more interactive and confident when encountering with the society.

One extracurricular activity you can participate in would be a sport. Over the course of years students have became more obsessed, which also can mean less active. Being obsessed can affect a persons health. In the last five years children ranging of ages 10-17 have became more and more less active. So by playing a sport you can become more active and healthier. However sports can help with more than activity. When playing a sport, you will want to get better at a objective in the game. When you are wanting to get better that is known as a goal. When having goals you are having to work harder to reach for that specific accomplishment. Setting goals while not only help you in sports but also in the future.

Helping with school yearbooks is another extracurricular activity. Doing yearbooks can mean a lot to your school because your are taking pride in your school. Taking pride in your school can mean a lot because it not only makes the school look good it makes you look good as a person. If you are doing yearbooks that means you are creative and have good unique ways of doing things. Being creative and able to think of new ideas can mean a lot in your future also because many businesses are looking for people who can bring big and better ideas to the table.

Lastly, being a student council takes a lot of responsibility and respect. Having this extracurricular activity you never know who you will or may encounter on a daily. When being a student council you should always try your best to be professional. Being social is another main concept because you are talking to people all the time. So being a student council takes a lot of effort and respect.

As a result, I think it is a good idea to let kids have extracurricular activities. These activities will help children be more interactive and prepared for the future. Helping students be more successful and active will help are society. Therefore, kids need to get good grades in order to take part in these activities. If you play a sport and your grades aren't good then your chances are lower to go to college for that specific sport. You could be the best leader, player, artist, or even have the best ideas but if you don't have good grades a college most likely won't except you. However, I think having extracurricular activities would really make students more confident and prepared for the society. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Extra activities with new people will help improve the social skills of students. Activities such as sports will keep them healthy and active. Do you not want students to be better people for others, and themselves?

First, Students that have an extracurricular activity will stay out of trouble. When a student is doing something good for them self, and they enjoy it, they will not be getting into much trouble. If students are playing a sport they will be motivated to stay healthy and stay away from drugs. Most extra curricular activities require good behavior. Therefore, if a student gets attached to an activity they will do their best to stay out of trouble.

Secondly, Students that less social skills can meet new people. Those students can create strong, long lasting bonds. Extra curricular activities can give students the friends they need that make them happy. Some friendships are even like family, and those types of bonds are important. We need students to have strong bonds and stronger social skills.

Finally, These activities can keep the students healthy, and active. Sports will have students always moving and keep them in shape. Some activities will teach you about nutrients and how to support your body. Activities like these will keep you healthy and make you feel better about yourself. If everyone participates in these activities than everyone will be happy, healthy, and active.

C32DE5F18B26,"Do you think all kids should have to do an extracurricular activity for school? I think having extracurricular activities is good to have in schools because it gives kids the chance to do different things they want to do. I also think schools should encourage students to do extracurricular activities. However, I do not think students should be forced to do an extracurricular activity at school because they might be too busy with there school work, they might have an after school job, and they could already be doing an extracurricular activity outside of school.

My first reason why students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities is because they might be to busy with school work at home. Teachers give out a lot of homework in each class and some students need a lot of time to do it. Making them do an activity after school, that they probably don't even want to do, might give them a hard time because then they might not get there homework done. If they manage to do do the activity and get there homework done then they might get to bed later than usually then they will not be able to do there best the next day and all the days after.

My second reason why students shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity is because they might have a job after school. Even if the activity that student joined only meets once a week they still might need to work that day and can't request off. They also might have the job because they need to help provide for there families. You never know what a student goes through outside of school.

My last and finally reason why students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is because what if they are already doing one outside of school. A lot of students are already doing something they want to do outside of school and if they get forced to do an extracurricular activity in school they wouldn't have enough time for the one there doing outside of school. They shouldn't have to quit one they might have been doing there whole life with friends they love to start a whole new one. It wouldn't be fair to the student.

In conclusion, students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities because they might not have time to do one because of personal reasons. They might have to help provide for there family because there parents can't, they might need extra help with school and have a tutor help them everyday, or they might already be doing an extracurricular activity outside of school. You do not know what they do when they aren't at school. Therefore, you can't make them do things that the might not be able/want to do.   ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
AE4E01E44C0F,"I agree with doing at least one extracurricular activity. Do you like to have fun with others? If so, you should think about doing an extracurricular activity because you will have fun, it can teach you new things, and you can make new friends.

The first reason for doing an extracurricular activity is because you can have so much fun. For example, if you decide to do yearbook then you can go around your school to take pictures. You can also do volunteer work for your school games. Whenever you are out most of the time you are having fun. If you are with your friends then that's even more fun.

The second reason is that these activities can teach you new things. Say if you never played a sport before and you decide to join a team then this can teach you how to play. Learning new things can help you improve your curricular for school. You're also opening up a window that never been open before. Learning new things can also be fun, just give it a try.

The final reason is because you can make new friends. In my opinion, everybody needs friends or at least somebody to talk too. For example, say you chose to join a boy/girl scouts and nobody there knows each other that is a good opportunity to make new friends. It's not always easy making new friends, but in the end it's worth it.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities are important, because you will enjoy it, you can learn a lot from your activity, and you can also meet new people. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
E6337FDAD05A,"Should all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity? I personally disagree, even though it is a good idea, some students don't have the time to participate in these activities. Many students already participate in activities outside of school and are usually busy enough with school work and studying. Im sure some students would enjoy this but it is not meant for all students.

When kids come home from school they want to have a break, they dont want to go straight back to work, they want to sit down and maybe have a snack. School is already hard enough and they would get overwhelmed with more activities to do. Some kids don't have the time to participate in extracurricular activities because they might already have something planned or they might be trying to do different activities that they actually want to do. If they were forced to participate in these activities it would put on a lot of stress and take away time for them to do something else. Many kids have to go somewhere after school and they might not have any free time to do these activities.

A lot of students already participate in extracurricular activities outside of school and it takes up a lot of their time so if they had to take part in the activities again, it would not only take up a lot of time, but the students would have to cope with more things on their to do list, which leads to stress, and less free time to do things with their friends or by them selves. Also if kids had to do these extracurricular activities they would miss out on other things such as homework, or events. They would also miss out on things they have already signed up for and if they don't participate in these activities I'm sure they would get in trouble.

Some kids take a break when they get home and some kids go straight to homework. School work and homework take up many hours of your day, and if we participated in these activities it would add to our to do list. Many kids like to study for hours and put all their effort into school, so I imagine they would be exhausted at the end of the day. If we were forced to participate in the extracurricular activities it could take away time from our sleep, when someone doesn't get as much sleep as they usually do they don't work as hard the next day and they would not be in a good mood the next day.

These extracurricular activities could be fun and they would be good on a resume, but they aren't meant for everyone. They would take up to much time with all the school work and activities everyone already has, and some kids don't want to do them because they would feel overwhelmed with everything they already have to do. Also if they participated in these extracurricular activities they would miss out on things. That is why I personally disagree with this idea.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
FD617838612E,"I think that giving kids an after school activity is great because they could have more social time. Meaning as in they could see their friends more often and talk to them more. They could have more exercise physicaly and mentally based on their activity. And they could also make new friends to talk to and then they could have a better realtionship. But the only problem with this is that some students might not like staying after school and just want to go home early. So if the principal does this students could start acting up like they always do. And also another problem could also be that students might have somewhere to be or they already have a after school program that they go to. But another reason why this is good and also important is because students can find a new skill or talent that they never knew they had. And they could start improving on that and use that new skill or talent in the future. Students will also be trying out new things and this could possibly help them out with classes in their regular schedule.

And here are some activitys that students could particapte in. Sports, they could particapte in any sport and that could help them physicaly. Like football because most athletic students join football because of the many postions there are in the sport. In football students don't have to be in any type of physical form like it does not matter if you are skinney or fat. This is because football has many postions that will need bigger people so students who think that they are over weight and can't do any sports should try doing football. And if you are not really the physical type of person then schools also have other programs as well. Like if you are a more smart type of person or you are a person who likes calmer activitys and likes to exercise their brain out then you could go to the game club and their could be some board games their that require lots of smart thinking and stragety. This game could be like chess a lot of people like chess and I think that chess is a good game to learn and play because how it exercises the brain. So if a student wants find a game that is fun,easy and stragetic to learn and play I think that chess is the perfect game.

And if there are students who don't like physical or stragetic activitys then there are still dancing and chorus activitys. If students think that they can be good with instruments they could go in to band and do some practicing there and even though it is not an after school activity it is still a skill that students can learn and develop and could possibily be good at it. Band is pretty easy though because anyone can learn no matter how smart you are if you just put in the right amount of effort and practice and if you also pay attention during the class you will understand it easily. So that is what I feel about the extracurricular activitys I personally think that it is a great idea and it should totaly be a thing in school today and all students should try something new out.          ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
F25BD0534126,"Yes I do feel that kids should do sports but this isnt my choice to make. The principle should not be able to ethier it is against are laws. In this cuntrey we have the right to have a choice and vote, and that cant be taken away.

Now I do feel that kids are not getting out into the world enough. This is because of technolgy, kids dont want to go outside with there friends. kids are staying inside playing video games, and that is a fact. Now a mix of both is great and brings the best of both worlds to are comunity.

People have the right to chose, and if you are taking away this then you are taking away from rights. It is a great idea, but it won't work all of the time, because kids have things to do when they get home. And if they are already playing sports outside of school, how are they going to fit this into there schedule. The school does not know what they do at home so how can they expect them to do homework and everthing else in just one week.

This issue can be fixed, by sending home a letter. This letter will ask the parents if they can make the kids play sports. This will eliminate the issue because parents can say if they play a sport already. And if they already are busy, and cant, then they dont have to do a sport or an activity after school.

All in all this is a great thing and a horrible thing because it does not always work. Kids need the right of choice, it is an essintial right, that we even as adults need. But kids also need to get outside into the world and ,sweat, workout, and play. with this comprimise I have shown teachers, and parents can figure this out. With my take on this issue I feel I have coverd all ground, and have shown what needs to be done to make the parents and the principle comprimise.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
9B25973C7209,"Studies show that 96% of students that participate in extracurricular activities report a better school experience, than those that do not partake in extracurricular programs. ""Those students are less stressed, and less likely to suffer from depression,"" says the Virginia Health Organization, ""than the students that are inactive, regarding participation in after school programs."" Partaking in these programs is vital to the well-being and growth of students! Students should participate in extracurricular activities because they are beneficial to mental health, focus, and one's college application.

First, extracurricular activities benefit mental health. A study, conducted by Harvard students, focused on the benefits and effects of extracurricular activity on pupils. In the study, they signed up students who felt overwhelmed, stressed, and depressed, due to school. They put them on sports teams, debate clubs, anything they had available that the student reported being interested in. Then they scheduled therapy sessions with each participant. What they saw was an increase in general happiness, and a decrease in the students' stress. Professional psychologist Jane Woods says, ""Patients who are active and participate in more school activities rarely suffer from depression. Students who are active in school appear to have much more extroverted and social personalities. Being social reduces risk of feeling alone and improves mental stability."" A girl, who explains that she used to be introverted and kept to herself, now says that, ""After I joined the soccer team I felt free. I talked to people, and have since opened up. I do travel soccer now, and I have left my problems behind me."" Students should join extracurricular activities because it is freeing and rewarding towards mental health.

Second, getting involved in extracurricular programs can improve focus. ""I used to not be able to listen in class,"" explains high school student, Generic_Name, ""but now that my friends have invited me to join the debate team, I am always aware of what's happening in the classroom!"" Generic_Name' grades went from C's and D's, to A's and B's in the matter of a month simply because, he joined debate club. A study done by Yale predicted that extracurricular activity would decrease focus, but what they found was very different. In fact, all of the students they interviewed and monitored saw an increase in grades after signing up for an after school activity. Those students additionally reported better focus in the classroom just like Generic_Name. Famous psychologist Emma Roberts wrote in a study that, ""Extracurricular activity improves the brains ability to focus on more than one thing at once, resulting in a better ability to focus on one thing."" Brain scans conducted on students before and after a week participating in after school activities, demonstrate the differences. Before participation, the brain scans showed less activity in the frontal lobe, and instead random activity in other areas in the brain, which indicated they were less focused. After participation however, activity in the frontal lobe spiked, and random activity in other unneeded areas, had almost completely stopped. Science only proves that extracurricular activities improve a students focus.

Finally, extracurricular activity looks good on a college application. 80% of colleges around the US reported that students with extracurricular programs listed on their application form, were more likely to get accepted than those without. Professional school applicant reviewer, Scott Berry, agrees, stating, ""We look for participation in after school activity. It demonstrates a well driven individual with multiple abilities."" A student who wasn't accepted into her dream school says, ""I had great grades, but I just hadn't participated as much as other students, and those students were accepted over me."" Having more participation will increase your chances of getting into a good college because, it's what they're looking for.

However, some say that it will only give students more stress because, they'll just have more to do. This is blatantly untrue, as demonstrated by a small school in Japan, that makes every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity. ""As opposed to other schools in the area,"" states the principal, ""Our students are happier, and report having less stress."" A student who was recently transferred to that small school from another school says, ""In my other school there were so many of my friends that were tired all the time, and we were all stressed out. In this school our extracurricular activities provide as an escape, or a release, from that stress.""

In conclusion, participation in extracurricular activities is beneficial to mental health, focus, and college applications. Students are too stressed and after school activities could provide as a release. Our students would suffer from less mental health issues such as depression if we integrated this school rule. Students would be more focused and grades would improve. In addition, students would get accepted into better colleges which can only look better for our school. This is an incredible opportunity many miss out on, but we don't have to. I hope that our school establishes that every student join an extracurricular activity.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
57D117F52A26,"Students should not be forced to do any extracurricular activities against their will. Making the decision of forcing students to do extracurricular activities will decrease their will to work, increase cost for schools, and need time to breathe. Here is why forcing students to do extracurricular activites is so bad.

One of the reasons why students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities is that they will not want to do anything and will not do anything. If students were forced to work on the yearbook, the students working on it will not do anything and not try their best. Then the yearbook would be done poorly or not even done at all. If the students were forced to be on the student council then they would not do anything at all and the council would be just for show. Whatever extracurricular activities they will be forced to do, they will not try hard at all and nothing will be done at all.

Another reason why students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities is that it will increase costs for the school. The school would have to pay for any supplies and teacher that stays after. If the school were to have a basketball team, the school will have to pay the teacher for staying after and the basketballs in case they don't have them or need more. If there was a board game club, the school will have to pay for the board games and the teacher staying after. Each activity needs supplies and a teacher to supervise or help the students so the overall costs will go up if the amount of students that stay after go up.

The last reason why students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities is that some people need time to breathe after school. They cannot go to school and then right after school do even more work they may not even like. They would rather indulge in their hobbies and have fun playing games or outside with friends and have fun doing the things they love. They students may even crash from all the work given to them without a break.

Making the decision of forcing students to do extracurricular activities will decrease their will to work, increase cost for schools, and need time to breathe. Why should students be forced to do something they don't want to and will harm the school's budget? Students need choice and need to enjoy life without someone forcng them to do something they don't like. Thats why overall, students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
5CC94F3773B1,"I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Participating in an extracurricular activity could help students build their teamwork skills. Depending on which extracurricular activity students participate in, it could help strengthen some of their teamwork skills and their ability to work with others. It could also help some shy students become more social and help them want to work with others and participate in different activities. Say someone who really didn't like working with other people, and only liked to do things by himself, joined the soccer team. When they would play practice games he would never pass to anyone, he kept the ball to himself, even when a few of his teammates were wide open, he never passed to them because he wanted to make the goal himself. However, every time he tried to make a goal alone, he always failed, and soon he learned that he would never make a goal by keeping the ball all to himself. He learned that in order to win, he must pass the ball and work with his teammates, passing the ball back and forth. He learned that the only way to win was through teamwork, had he not joined the soccer team, it would have taken him a while to learn that sometimes it's best to work with people, and joining that soccer team helped him build up his teamwork skills. Having students participate in an extracurricular activity will help strengthen their teamwork skill and help some people figure out what they like, what they don't like, and lean how to be more comfortable around people.

Students can figure out what they're into, what they like to do and what they don't like to do. When students participate in different activities they figure out that they might like soccer and pottery, but hate drawing and writing. They get to figure out what they enjoy and what they don't enjoy, and some may like doing something so much that they might what to do it as a job later in life when they're older. In 5th grade I joined orchestra because I wanted to try something new. I chose to play the cello because I had heard people playing their cello's a while ago, but I remembered how beautiful it sounded. Also because I had seen a movie then about this girl who played the cello and she played beautiful pieces and wanted to play the cello as her career. It was an amazing movie and after watching it I could not get it out of my head. So that's when I decided i wanted play the cello. The first year playing the cello was pretty difficult because I did not know how to read the music and my teacher at my elemetry school was not really teaching me how to read the notes, but I was not really trying to either so that made it pretty difficult. The second year was a little better but still pretty bad because I still had not learned how to properly read the music. I had the same music teacher as last year and she still did not teach me how to read the notes or what they were called, but then again, just like last year, I was not really trying either. I would recognize some of the notes but still had no idea what they were called. So in those two years i basically learned how to play the cello, but not how to read what I played. Coming into middle school, I did not think I would continue to play the cello, considering my experience from the 2 years before, but I did choose to continue playing the cello going into middle school. That's where I met my new orchestra teachers and they taught me how to read the music. It took sometime but know I can read music sheets perfectly fine and I continued to play the cello into 8th grade as well. I tried something new, and the first 2 years were not the best, but towards the end, I ended loving to play the cello, even if Im not the best at it. Growing up kids find out what they enjoy and what they dislike, and that shapes how they see things and their personality. Including figuring what they want to do in the future, by figuring out what they enjoy doing, and avoiding the things they don't enjoy doing or being apart of, while having fun.

Students can have fun while participating in extracurricular activities and enjoy themselves. Students can have fun with they're friends while participating in different activities and might get to do cool projects and experiments, depending on what activity they participate in. Whichever one students decide to participate in, they'll have fun with the people who are in that activity as well while still participating and doing what they're told by the teacher in charge of that activity. In orchestra we play a lot of different music for different concerts and also just as warm ups. Almost everyone has a stand partner, unless someone has their own stand. You might need to talk to your stand partner and sometimes you become friends with them. Though it does not seem like it, you can make a lot of friends in orchestra, even if you play a different instrument or sit across the room from each other. There are times where we have to be serious, like preparing for a concert or during a concert, but before we can talk to each other, practice together, or just talk sometimes. One time before a concert, my best friends sat next to me and we started playing pieces together, even thought we don't play the same instrument. We have fun with our friends and we enjoy playing together, even if we mess up a lot, it is still fun. Students get to enjoy themselves and have fun while still doing the work that they must do for that activity and get to figure out what they like doing and what they dislike, also while being with their friends.

All students should participate in extracurricular activities because participating them can help students in so many ways. They can teach students what they like and what they dislike and learn different things depending on which activity you're apart of. Students also get to have fun and spend time with their friends while also working and participating with the activity.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
196B4ED6FA4F,"I do agree with making students do one extracurricular active such as sports, clubs ,and teaching program it would make the school healthier, kinder,and smarter. The student body at my school isn't very healthy, smart, or kind. Most of the student body isn't very involved with the school and that needs to change. Having student do things such as sports, clubs, and teaching program would change the student body as a whole.

First, most students at

Generic_Name are in as much shape as a billboard, they arent very active. By making students sign up for a sport would change that, not only would it make the student body healthier, but also it would bond the school. Sports could even pay off in the end for students but also schools. The way sports can change a school are endless but you can't have a sport team with out students. By making students sigh up for sports you are not only grantee a sport team but also a healthier and kinder school.

Second, Sports aren't for everyone maybe students want to become smarter or kinder in their school and community. Students could do that by joining a club like the F.O.R club. Students could also help their school by joining S.C.A

both of these clubs are very active. They are active in both their community and their school. Having students join clubs would benefit the school in health but it would benefit the schools community. If students were to join clubs the schools would be a safer and better place for both students and staff.

Third, some are students that aren't very active in both sports and the community. Those students could join teaching program to help benefit students. Those students would also be benefiting the school too. These student would most likely want to be come teachers. This program would benefit them, other students and the school. It would benefit them because they are getting early teaching skills. It would help teachers by not having them teaching program student when they could be making lessons and by having smarter students. All around this program would make the school a smarter place.

Is making students join one extracurricular active a good idea? Yes it is both students and the school would benefit from this rule change. The schools sports teams, clubs, and teaching program would be booming. When you have people coming to your sport, club, or program you can do bigger and better things. All around the pros out weight the cons that is another great reason the make the rule change.

Some students can't just stay afterschool just because the principle wants them to and most of them have to take care of younger siblibgs afterschool. Around this age students start getting little side jobs to save up for things they may want so stay afterschool would not be an option.

Just because students don't stay after school doesnt mean they dont have nothing to do students also have sports and other activities to do outside of school. It could also be hard for students due to lack of transportation from school back home.

Students have other things they need to worry about instead of just going to stay afterschool for sports and other activites.

439E777B693D,"Have you ever been forced to do something that you don't want to do? Well thats what would be happening if schools required all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Schools should not be allowed to make it a must for students to do extracurricular activities because some kids might not be comfortable with doing an activity at school that shouldn't be required, kids don't want an extra thing on top of school work, and many students might already have plans for after school or their parents aren't able to take their kids to the places they need to go.

Many students might already have plans for at, or during school, or their parents aren't able to take them where they need to be. Not all families can afford cars or transportation, and others might not be able to get to where they need to be because their parents are at work or are busy. A lot of kids play sports, and they have practices often. Students that do have practices often cannot go to an extracurricular activity because of those practices. Other students may have activities that they need to do outside of school. I play soccer and I practice twice a week. That might not sound like a lot, but almost two hours wasted practicing soccer after school, is time I could've used to work on the extracurricular activities that I have to do. When I get home from soccer, I have to study and do homework for my classes instead of doing my extracurricular work. Now that I don't have time to do the activities, I get it trouble for it.

I feel that all kids are already pressured with lots of homework and studying or other things that happen in their life, and students don't want anything else to do other than the activities they already do. Teachers say that they don't assign a lot of homework, dont make us study a lot, or take tests very often. I think that we do get a lot of homework and teachers do expect a lot from us, and just putting more expectations on us that involve activities that we were forced to do and we might not care about, is just not fair. Doing all those things that we need to do for school is hard to do when we also want to have fun in life and play video games all the time instead of doing homework.

Many students are not comfortable with doing an activity at school that shouldn't be required. A lot of students don't want to do sport activities, or school council, or work on the year book because they don't want to be judged on how fast they can run, how good they can kick a ball in sports, or how cool looking they can make the year book look. Students also don't want to just be judged when they might join the student council. Students might have a bullying problem and they want to get home fast so they don't have to keep getting bullied, but they have to go to their extracurricular activity. The bully might be there andkeep harassing that student.

Overall, schools forcing students to do extracurricular activities would not be a good idea because some kids might not be comfortable with doing an activity at school that shouldn't be required, kids don't want an extra thing on top of school work, and many students might already have plans for after school or their parents aren't able to take their kids to the places they need to go.

17D2212B02FC,"Would you rather go home and rest after a long day at school, or have to stay at school for a couple more crucial hours? School is already very tiring and having to do an extra activity would not be very fun. Students should not be forced to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it limits outside school activities, it is mentally and physically draining for both students and teachers, and it causes extra funding.

One reason why participating in extra activities is pointless is because it limits outside school activity. Many people, including me, take foreign language classes after school. So, having to stay for yearbook, student council, or anything extra, would interfere with these classes. The majority of students volunteer or do charity work after school, and or on the weekends. I volunteer as a tutor every other day, but if I had to participate in extra activities, it would clash with my tutoring schedule. Participating in extracurricular activities is unnecessary because it shortens the things you can do outside of school.

Being included in extracurricular activities is mentally and physically draining for both students and teachers. All students wake up at six or earlier in the morning to go to school. Teenagers my age and older need sleep because we are in the growing process, so having to do something extra is not practical. Teachers already teach multiple classes throughout the day. Having another class to look after is not very beneficial. Students already come home from a long day at school and have to do more studying and homework. I usually dont sleep a lot, but yesterday when I came back from school I fell asleep at six in the evening! Participating in extracurricular activities has many negative effects, and one is that it causes students to be very tired.

Even though participating in extra activities gives you a better chance at getting into colleges, it causes extra funding. Schools are already responsible for paying for everything a school needs,such as lunches,vending machines, teachers paychecks, and much more. In reality, schools are not very rich, so it would be an unreasonable choice to have extracurricular activities. Schools would have to pay for after school snacks, overtime pay checks for teachers, and more. Its not a very strategic move when your not financially stable. Participating in extracurricular activities is unpractical because it causes extra funding.

Students should not be forced against their will to take part in extracurricular activities. Everything you can do from participating in sports to serving on student council are tiring and should be done by choice, not by demand.

It would disturb the student schedule and the parents plans for their kid! For example the parents have an appointment for a future date. Then get a email that their daughter signed up for soccer and the team meets on the same day the parents had their kids appointment for. They would have to change everything and make a new appointment and it can take a long time. Or their kid stays after but theres no late buses on that day and both parents are working and can't pick them up. What would they do then? It would be just a hassle for both the student or parents.

Whats would happen if only a few students or too many join? It would cause a lot of problems for the school to deal with. Like If only two students join basketball, what would they do? They can't play with only two so they would have to disband. But then if one activity is full and a bunch of people want to only join that activity it would cause headaches for the staff and teachers. Also what would happen if a bunch of people have no interest in any of them, you cant force them so you really wouldn't have control of the situation at hand. So it wouldn't really even work if theres going to be so many problems.

It would also be a waste of time for the teachers or coaches if your going to make it official. For the students who do pick something but have no interest in it , it be a waste of time for the teachers teaching. They would just not listen or do anything. So why should the teachers have to teach them when they could teach the actual kids who might want to learn? For the kid who just signed up for the sake of it being mandatory, they could be having other plans for studying or spending time with their family. Also it would be especially bad if a student signs up for a sport and does nothing to help out. It would be bad for the actual kids who want to play and the whole team , then the money spent into the activities. It would just be a waste of time,money and effort put into the whole thing.

So I would definitely disagree with the idea of the mandatory extracurricular activities because of the hassle for the parents, the non interest and waste in time. It would just be horrible and trouble for the whole school, and we wouldn't want that. We should just stick with what the students want to do and let them pick what they want and let them have fun.                ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
3EAA08EB3E4E,"School days can be a drag at times, and can cause a lack of interest and become unmotivated in school. Then at the end of every school day, most of us go home to relax from the day we went through, but sometimes going home to the same old routine can become boring. However, the principal announcing that every student should take an extracurricular activity sounds like a great solution to this, because these activities will allow students to interact with others, introduce students to be able to learn new skill sets, and give students a chance to participate in activities they love.

One reason that the principal's decision is a good idea is because this will allow students to interact with each other more often. Sure, we do that everyday during school, but if you were to join a club or group, it would be a great opportunity to make new friends. Since you would be choosing a group based on your interests instead of attending a common subject, this would mean that others in your group would share the same interests as you, which is great for connecting with others. For example, when I was in a little soccer league, I was able to talk and play with others while knowing that they liked the same things that I did, which made me feel included and a part of the team. Being able to interact with others also allow for the improvement of social and teamwork skills. Playing in a sport is a good example of this because of how teammates cooperate with each other to reach their goal and win the game. It can be fun during games when you pass the ball to each other before shooting a goal, making making the whole team know that they all made a big contribution during the game.

Another reason that having a required extracurricular is a good idea is how they can give students a chance to find new hobbies and skills. Whatever extracurricular you choose can introduce you to a skill set based off your liking. Say if someone were interested technology, computers, robots and such. They could join a coding or engineering club, which could become an new hobby for themselves. This can also apply to choosing activities out of someone's comfort zone. Students that choose to join groups out of their average liking can lead to the development of a new hobby that they never knew they had. Once when I had to stay after school to attend a concert, so I had to take an activity in the meantime. One of the only choices available was a social study group, which I needed at the time. It turned out to be a pleasant experience while working with others. Gaining new hobbies from extracurricular activities can also skills to help students find what they're going to do in the future. Like if someone were interested in wildlife or animals. That person could join a wildlife conservation group or an awareness group of some sort, so they could be involved with the thing they love and be introduced to a new skill that can also be beneficial in their community and even in their future.

A third reason for why required extracurricular activities are a good idea is that they can allow students to enjoy themselves. Students know how it feels to have to lag through every school day, as well as having to worry about their grades and piling school work. Being in an extracurricular can take your mind off of school in the moments you're in that group, and let you enjoy the time you spend there instead of having to stress yourself out more than you can handle. And, as previously stated, you'll be able to spend time with other students who know what it's like to face unmotivated times in school, home, or any other place. They can all talk to each other and do what interests them while even learning about topics without having piles of work to do afterwards, like in a coding club. And you'll be able to relax more often, or at the very least do what you think is fun. Like make arts and crafts, make or play games, play a sport, help the environment. Whatever you enjoy doing, there's most likely a club just for that. Something that you and any other student can enjoy.

Having to take a required extracurricular activity doesn't seem as bad when you think about it. You're able to be with and connect with others, discover new activities that you didn't even know you would enjoy, and take your mind off of the stressful events going on and enjoy yourself. So if you like the sound of that, then having an extracurricular seems like a great idea that you can give a chance.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
81E073241214,"I do not agree. I think that students shouldnt have to do any extracurricular activities if they dont want to. It should be a students/kids free choice to do what they want when it comes to extracurricular activities/hobbies. Adults shouldnt control that. These days students are very wide spanned.

A lot of kids have different interests on what they like to do. A lot of interests/hobbies arent an option in school and they shouldn't have to be forced to do one. Most kids dont have much freetime and by the schools doing this it takes away that time for a student/kid to do what they like. Yes, it's different if someone likes one of the activities provided but thats usually not the case and kids these days tend to have a lot of interests.

A student may not enjoy any of these extracurricular activities. They should have the choice to do what they like and not be forced by the school and/or parent to do one. A lot of the time when a kid is forced into what activities to do he/she doesn't have fun. Sometimes that can lead to that person being sad all the time and that can even lead to a depressed child/student.

Some kids don't want to do any extracurricular activities at all. Some students sometimes dont have any interests and all they wanna do is sit around and eat or something like that. At a young age a lot of students haven't even found an interest or something they like to do and it can be hard for them to have fun or enjoy doing something like that. Every student is different and some are just very lazy and either don't see the need to do anything or just dont feel like it.

As you can see and probably observe in your life to is that the generation these days are very difficult. Some people even know things they like to do or know what there good at age 18 or even older. Therefore the schools shouldn't be allowed to force people to do even just 1 because it may seem like something easy or something that should be mandatory but its only fair not to. These days students are very wide spanned.                 ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
F5152BBB18F6,"Imagine yourself in your room and your mom comes in and says, "" Find an activity to do outside."" You just moan and roll your eyes. Don't do that. Find a friend that will join you in your journey of an activity and make it fun. You can find so many activities to do. You can do a sport, an outdoor activity, anything.

What you choose can be a helpful thing for your friend. They may enjoy the activity and want to do it more often. Including, getting stronger and faster during it. Also, they may be determined to go outside more often, instead of being stuck inside all day on technology. It can be a great exercise to do, and it may be really fun to do.

Although your parents bug you about it, think about all the things your parents have done for you. They clean the house, do the laundry, and make you meals. So, in appreciation of your parents, go and have fun outside. Now, your parents can read their book they've been waiting to read. They can take more naps so they're not so cranky.

Also, they can have less stress and not yell as much. And also, less messes for them to clean up.

All of this can also be really helpful for you. You may work more harder than you have in the past. You may find more activities that seem fun and try them for yourself. You'll also be outside more and make your parents happy. These activities can help with your exercise. It may even be really fun, that it doesn't even feel like a workout.

In conclusion, doing something your not comfortable doing, can help everyone in some way. You may help a friend get outside more and have a great time. Your parents can have more free time to do what they want to do. Instead of having to pick up after you and your messes.

You can help yourself by being more active in activities and have fun. Lastley, everyone can help someone in any way that may not include an outdoor activity. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
6D1394C0D7D4,"Students should participate in extracurricular activities at school so they have a better understanding on how they can work on themselves. I think we should participate in more activities at school because it will help students practice classes they're struggling with at school, they can learn how to work appropriately with others, and it will make them more productive people in the future. Having an opportunity for more activities can encourage kids to try harder at school and become better people instead of being in your house trying to figure out what to do today.

To begin, working with teachers can give students more options to get more help or give others help if they are having rough times in school. They can go to teachers to ask what they are doing wrong and fix their mistakes they are making during class. Kids can also do extra credit work to raise their grade or just get a better understanding of what they are working on in class. They can also try out for more advanced work after school if they don't feel as challenged as they should to help them for better futures. Getting more help from teachers can make students smarter and feel less stressed once they actually realize what their teacher is writing on the whiteboard.

Next, doing sports or clubs can teach students how to get along better working with others. It will help students make more friends so they don't feel left out or alone on a team when they are with more people because they might feel awkward. More kids will feel more comfortable acting like themselves in larger groups once they get to know everybody the proper way. It will also teach the kids teamwork and how to communicate with others and let them know how you feel like if you need their help learning a skill you don't have but they do. Working nicely with others can really give a person a good reputation around others.

Lastly, having more options to do in school makes students more productive and energetic people. Most kids will like to play sports with their friends and excerise instead of playing video games at home. Doing clubs gives an opportunity for kids to express themselves and be with the people who have the same interest as them which will make them more friends. Also, doing something like fundraisers for their school will teach them how to become better citizens and help with our environment. This would give students more energy to work hard and play harder than when they were younger because now they are more exercised.

In conclusion, we should have extracurricular activities for the students to have better futures by working well with others, practicing work from school or other things they arent the best at, and become harder workers and become more productive. The students will also have a better understanding of maybe a career path they would like to follow when they are older. The kids will get more practice at school than at home where parents might not give them the help they need so they will have activities at school. The more kids do these activities the more they will encourage other kids to do more of these activities. I think that all students should be required to do these extracurricular activities at school in order to prepare themselves for a future.     ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
7AAE019F70D6,"I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because kids have other things to do like homework,they might be already doing a activity and they'll get tired faster if the principal make them do a other activity, and it can contain stress if you don't get it right the first time.

For and foremost, I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because the student have homework to do and I know that i get a lot of homework maybe you do too i also know teachers give kids projects and if the principal makes them do a extra activity then they wont be able to have anytime to do their own things. Also studies have shown that making kids do a extra activity can contain a lot of stress and who wants to be stressing I know I don't, and it can also contain kids losing sleep do to the activities if they have homework and a activity to do it'll make the students lose sleep due to the activity and the brain needs a good hours of sleep for it to function well. This is why I say principals shoudn't make students join activies

Secondly, I disagree with the principal because the students will get way more tired faster and did you know that someone in Washington DC, fainted due to the principal making the student do a other activity and thats why the principals shouldn't make students join a other activity because it'll most likely make them get tired faster and what we want is to keep our kids healthy but we can't keep them healthy if the principal makes them join a activity.

Lastly,my last reason is stress, stress can come from a lot of things like work,school,friends,parents,children as you see stress comes from a lot and school stress is a big oe because we all know sometimes our grades go down and when we try to bring them up it gets really stressful and espcially if your pricipal is making you do a other activity that'll make even more stress and multiple studies have shown that a lot of the stress that kids get is from school and other activies. Those were all of my reason on why the principal shouldn't make students join a other activity espcially if they don't want too.

Overall,I disagree with the principal making students do a other actvity because of homework,losing sleep faster and last but not least is stress. Those were all of my reasons on why the principal shouldn't mame students do a other activity ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
06814DF362D6,"Have you ever wanted to do something for your school, but didn't know what? This would be the perfect chance for you. I agree that students should participate in one school activity because it's a good way to make new friends, it allows students to step out of their comfort zone, and it's a good way for students to do something for their school.

First, this is an excellent way for students to make friends. Some students struggle making friends, this would allow them to find someone with the same interests as them. They get to communicate with students they have never met before. Making students participate in one of the activities may help them find a long term friend. plus, this will help them be able to make friends with anyone and they won't have to struggle anymore.

Secondly, this allows students to step out of their comfort zone. Students will have the opportunity to express themselves with the other people in that certain activity. Maybe a student had a great idea, this might be the chance to share it with others. Some students struggle with stepping out of their comfort zone. Maybe one of these activities will help them with that.

Lastly, this is an excellent way in participating in your schools everyday. The students that enjoy sports can join the football team, or even the baseball team. For those students who like art can join the yearbook staff. Let's not forget those who enjoy school spirit, they can join the students council. These are all great ways to be involved with your school.

It's a good way to make new friends, it allow students to step out of their comfort zone, and it's a good way to be involved in your school.

DC430F1F553A,"My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some of those things students can do is sports, work on the school yearbook,and serve on student council. I agree on this choice because it can help students in many ways such as making friends, having fun, and can look good on college papers. Those are only some of the reasons extracurricular activities are helpful.

Being in extracurricular activities can make it easy to make friends. One example of this is when i joined soccer, i didnt know anyone so i had to make new friends. That helped me become much less nervous around them. so i can now joke and hang around them instead of feeling left out. Making friends can also help with having fun.

Having fun can come from making friends just like i did. One example of this is when i play soccer i can have a fun time with my friends as we win games. I liked being able to have fun with my friends at soccer because it helped build teamwork and a fun experience i will never forget. Another benefit of having fun and friends is it can look good for college.

Doing extracurricular activities can help with college too. Extracurricular activities can help you go to college by giving you scholarships for things like Wrestling, Baseball, Football, and American football. These scholarships can get you into colleges for free as long as you are in a sport or, they have a set amount of year you can use that scholarship. These scholarships can be very helpful because you wont pay nearly the same amount of money if you just went to college without a scholarship.

My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some of those things students can do is sports, work on the school yearbook,and serve on student council.

EEC9540E73FD,"Some schools have debated if they should make every single student participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that they should not make kids do extracurricular activities they don't want to do. It would be extra work for the school and it would be bad for the students. If the principal decided to change the school's system so that each and every student would have to do an extracurricular activity it would end up negatively for most students. The main reasons it would be bad are many children will not have the time to do work they shouldn't have to do, kids are already stressed enough with their school work and other things, and many kids who are being forced into doing this probably wouldn't enjoy these activities. So because of these reasons, I believe that we should just keep our school's system the same and the school should not make someone do an unnecessary activity that they didn't want to take part in in the first place.

One of the more relevant reasons that proves that the school shouldn't be able to have this power is so many kids have too much on their plate that they must do, and they just don't have the time to complete all of this. While some may say that kids have too much free time and we should give them something to do so they aren't on electronics, I strongly disagree with that statement. I am a student, and a majority of my peers take part in many other activities, such as sports, musical instruments, plays, and any other things along those lines, that wouldn't allow them to have any spare time to do another activity. In fact, according to a study performed by Harvard University, almost 85 percent of students participate in after school activities that take up more than 8 hours of time per week. This would include practicing the activity and for many activities you would have to compete. For example, one of my friends, Generic_Name, does many activities. She plays on a competitive lacrosse team, she plays a musical instrument, and she takes all honor classes. She barely finishes all of her homework, and she has stupendous time management skills. If she had to take part in another after school activity, she wouldn't have time to do it all. Because kids do other things, if you made them partake in a new activity they would also become a lot more stressed.

Students are already stressed enough with school and other activities. If you make them participate in another activity, that will make their stress levels go up and could possibly push them over the edge. It's obvious that students won't have the best time management skills because they are kids. Since they don't have these skills, they will end up being stressed about completing their work. In a survey I compiled with seventh and eighth graders at my middle school, I discovered that a whopping 94 percent of students considered themselves stressed. 76 percent even went as far to say that they are overly stressed. This puts into perspective how students are already very stressed without the excess activities. Personally, I partake in a travel volleyball team, a musical instrument, all honor classes, I make sure that I study enough and do all of my homework, and I make time to spend maximum amounts of time with my family and friends as possible. I manage to finish all of this, but many days I do not get much sleep. On most week days I get about 6 hours and the recommended amount of sleep for a thirteen year old is about 8. It can get very tough to finish all of my tasks I have to complete in one day. I know that if my school made me participate in another extracurricular activity I would not be able to complete all of this work I previously had to finish. And obviously school would be my top priority to complete, so I would possibly have to drop some of my hobbies and interests that I love. Another reason we shouldn't enforce this rule is that many kids that the school is forcing to do the activity probably won't enjoy it.

If the school enforces this new policy, many students will be unhappy because the activities the schools have to offer do not interest them at all. The main extracurricular activities that people partake at my school are plays and clubs where you can compete in, such as Model United Nations, debate club, Science Olympiad, and many others. At my school with over 1,000 students, only about 100 decide to join these clubs. These clubs only appeal to certain people that enjoy academics. If you're interested in things related to sports, my school does not have much to offer for you. When my sister was in middle school, about 7 years ago, they had very few clubs. They had 3 official clubs. Our mom made her choose a club to participate in. All that she could choose from was debate club, chess club, and homework club.

She had little to no interest in doing any of these clubs that she thought were boring and dumb. She ended up doing chess club, but she ended up hating it immensely. She said that everyone was better than her and she didn't even know how to play. This all happened because she was forced to pick an activity from three, horrible sounding, activities. This all would not have happened if no one had made her do an activity she despised. The same thing will end up happening to many children if the schools make them participate in activities they don't wish to do. Kids doing something that they don't want to do will end up with them being unhappy, which will end up in a negative learning environment.

Many kids will suffer majorly if a school was to go through with this ridiculous plan of forcing people to do an extracurricular activity that they do not wish to take part in. In the end, this will benefit basically nobody, because if someone really needed or wanted to participate in extra activities, they could without having to affect every person other than themselves in the school. Many would be upset with this new plan, so I believe that it would be best to keep our system the same.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
472760F320CD,"What is your idea self?

Someone whos smart and athletic?

Well let me tell you something.

You're not going to be that person by sitting on your butt watching 150 hours of the Office after school.

I think that every kid should have to participate in an extracurricular activity, whether its sports or a club.

Kids need to get out and do something.

If kids do and extracurricular activity its gets them away from their screens, helps with face to face interactions, and they need the extra physical activity because they dont get it in school.

Therefore I think that all kids should participate in a extracurricular activity.

First, kids are always on a screen of some sort.

When they are at school they are on screens. When they get home they are on their phone or on the TV.

After school activities are at least an hour or longer.

So if they get out of school at 3:35, with practice and the car ride they wont get home till around 4:50.

In addition, they might take a shower and they have to have dinner, so that takes a lot of screen time away.

With them doing an activity after school, it will get them away form their technology and they will be doing something productive.

Secondly, with kids being on their phones all the time, they dont get a lot of face to face interactions.

Doing an activity after school would help with getting that practice in.

It would force them to interact with other people and to make new friends.

Once kids get older they will not know how to look someone in they eye while talking, because they dont have to do that while testing someone.

Finally, its the only time kids can get real physical activity.

In gym they don't get a lot of exercise.

Kids don't like having to participate in activities that dont enjoy, especially with people they don't know.

If they don't want to do something they wont put in any effort.

At least when they are on a team they make bonds and friendships so that they enjoy what they are doing and put in the effort.

In conclusion, I agree that the principle should make kids participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

So that while they are doing their extracurricular they are wasting their screen time.

It helps they practice the face to face interaction with people.

Lastly, so it gives them the physical activity they need.  ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
270C9CF15B1B,"The principal wants to enforce a rule for every student to stay after school and do at least one extracurricular activity. Here is why I disagree.

I think the school shouldn't enforce a rule for the students to do extracurricular activities because students may have things to do after school. Instead, the principal should make a non-mandatory after school program for the students who want to stay after school.

I disagree with the principal's idea because students may have many things to do after school. For example, students may have to babysit their siblings, do sports, or simply have lots of homework to do when they get home. The principal enforcing a rule on the students making them do at least one activity makes it so that students don't have time to do what they need to do when they come home.

The principal should make a non-mandatory after school program for the students that don't have out of school activities. For example, Student help, clubs, or sport related activities. That way, students don't feel like it's a mandatory extra 2 hours of school but instead, it's an optional way of taking part in school activities.

EE5022C8157C,"The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Do you disagree or agree with him that all students must participate. Because 1 out of 5 kids do not have extracurricular activities at there school. I agree because the kids can learn some thing new, have help on a topic, and to have fun.

My first reason is that the students can learn something new. When they stay for a new club they can make friends and learn the new skill that the club is teaching . The club is a good way to learn some new things, make some new friends, and learn how to use this skill in life. When you join a club you will learn to love it. For instance not a lot of people came to Girls Who Code until we started to tell everybody how nice and fun it was. Now people are racing for spots in Girls who code. People who come to Girls Who Code will learn about programs and how your favorite game was made.

My next reason is that the students can get extra help in the many of clubs. Some of the clubs such as homework club can help you study. The school provides many clubs to help you with all of your topics. When you come to certain clubs there will be tutors there to help. The tutors are your fellow students that show up to help there class mates. When you stay after to get help your grades will go up by a lot. When they do you will be proud of them that you came too homework club.

My final reason is that the students need to have fun in the clubs. when the parents leave ore work the student is home alone. when the stay after they can hang out with there friends. The different clubs have different activities for the students to learn and have fun. Some kids just want to hang out with other kids. Students have to have some time relax and have fun in the clubs.

In conclusion all students must participate in a extracurricular activity so they can enjoy the clubs that the school has to offer. When they participate in the clubs they will be more ready to learn about that subject.

All of the clubs are really fun and educational.

3661D3C5DB6B,"I disagree with what the princicapel says since students here shouldn't be made do an curricular acitivity, it's uncostitutional.

Making Students do an extracurricular activivty will not work out since not all of the students at our middle school want to pick an activity to participate in.

This would looked at to be forced, since for the thew that don't pick an activity the school would have to choose a random activity for them to enjoy. I think if the school makes all the student do atleast one extracurricular activity it'll be like the school is forcing them to do it. Us students shouldn't be forced to do anything that's not part of the edjucation our school gives in the first place.

These activitys might be to much to handle for a student physically or mentally. Physically a student may not be able to compete in an activity such a an phisical sport due to a phisical or a mental condition. This is probably why the student didn't play the sport before the princaple made their decision.

Mentally this can also be rough on a student to particpate in an particular activity since it'd be more work for them handle arleady added on to the school work they already have. For example working on the year book all year and completing it before the deadline.

If a student doesn't play a sport or do anything woudn't they become lazy or even somewhat unhealthy. If you are asking this question you forgotten about the GYM class that all students are required to take at our middle school. Our GYM class activitys should provide every student to stay healthy and in shape here at our school. If a student wants to participate in an activity like playing a sport or joining a club it should be their choice and their parents choice to decide if they want to join in on an the activity or not. It shouldn't be the schools choice!

Students might improve socially and could have some fun their activity. Yes that is true but what if some or even most of the students don't enjoy their activity they're in. The proof for this is that this would happen a lot since the principle made the decicsion to have every student in a extra curricular activity whether they like it or not . I think that us students would be better off we can choose what we want to do, so we enjoy what we want to do.

Activity's arent always good for certain people they might need help on something or they feel sick, you cant always put school in front of everything. Activity's are great but you gotta make sure you are in the right state to do said activity.

School activities are a great way to socialize but its also bad if a student gets too anxious or cant handle said activity you cant make the student do an activity. School isnt for activity's either its meant for learning about socializing, and learning something new, and activity's might get in the way of studying or trying to remember certain things. Its very important to make sure your students are well kept and helped and that there not worked up.

Anxiety is a huge plus with school, there is many things to do and learn and adding to it might get a student worked up and its very important to keep a student feeling safe and knowing that there is help. I dont think its bad but i also say it isn't good there are pro's and con's to it and it depends on the student in general. You cant just focus on the student though you also have to worry about the parent and see what they say because there parent is the one that is giving the student the opportunity to do activities and if they dont like the idea maybe cast a vote.

All in all my opinion about making students do activities is a no for me there are good things about it but there is also bad things and making sure everyone is updated with the idea is a big step. Voting might help since it lets parents know and also gives them a choice but it also helps the student with there school academics.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
A42993C8FE60,"I agree with the principal, because doing an extracurricular actives can benefit kids in many ways. One way doing an extracurricular activity could benefit kids is by playing a sport it can teach them many things. Another way doing an extracurricular activity could benefit kids is join a student council is can teach kids how to use their voice. Last way is join any club.

A way join a sport could benefit kids is it can show kids what its like to be on a team. That can help them to get a job or if they already have one it can help them during their job. Another way playing a sport can benefit kids it can teach them how to work on a team and how to work well with others.

Another way how extracurricular act ivies could benefit kids is serving on student council it can help kids speak up or fight for what's or to make things equal. That can benefit kids in many ways, such as if while working a job you think something is not be treated right or if someone is not being treated equally you can speak up for what's right.

Last way joing an extracurricular activity could benfit kids is by joing a a club. Joing a club could help them interact with more people. Learning how to interact with people can help kids later on life, during a job, in school, or even in public.

In concluison joining an extracurricualr activity could help kids in many more ways then the ones sated above. Playing a sport could benfit kids by teaching them how to work togeter. Serving on a student conciual could help kids use their voice and fight for whats right. Last way is by joing a club it could help kids interact with people. You should join an extracurricular to see what could happen.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
B6B2D2FC8F3D,"Many schools offer a variety of extracurricular activities that students can participate in. Although many students are recognized for all of the activities they do, some of their fellow students do not participate in any. There are many excuses children and teens come up with as to why they can't participate, but there are a couple logical reasons that support their case. If a principal made every student engage in an extracurricular activity, I would disagree. I do not think students should be forced to do certain activities because they may not have the money to participate, they may be shy and performing in a sport or club is out of their comfort zone, and they may not have enough time.

Students do not have to have a ton of money to engage in sports or clubs, but the costs for those activities, for example, jerseys, props, and fund raising expenses, can become overwhelming. If you are involved in sports there are many expenses that come with the honor. You have to buy the right shoes and clothes to practice in, but that's not all. Getting training lessons for the activity can be very expensive and a hard task to achieve. Also, their parents might want to use the money for other things that are important to them like a family vacation, or eating out. Lastly, they may be participating in an activity out of school that is expensive, and having to pay for both a school activity, and after school activity can be difficult.

Many students are very shy and are not use to speaking up or performing in front of hundreds of people, and if it is your first time doing so, it can be very nerve-racking. Many teens know what they would have to experience if they participated, and after thinking about the hardships, they might decide to nothing at all. They may have an older sibling or friend to help them, but many students do not. Having a friend participate in the sport or club with you can be a great advantage, but some teens do not get that advantage. So forcing them to participate in an activity where they have no one to talk to during practice or to cheer them on, can make the activity seem boring.

Finally, the student many not have enough time. Some parents work late so finding a ride home or getting everything prepared for the activity can be hard. Also, a lot of students work on homework after school, if they played a sport or participated in a club, they may not have enough time to accomplish their studies, which in my opinion is the most important task of all. Students may not manage their time wisely. Finishing homework, participating in an activity, and still having a little free time at the end of the day is a lot to juggle. Without unlimited time on your hands, he or she may feel overwhelmed and stressed, which can lead to bigger problems.

To conclude, although I would respect the principal's ultimate decision, I disagree with her statement. Students should not have to be involved in an extracurricular activity. They should be able to choose if they want to participate in an activity. Ultimately, the students choice should be prioritized, because they know their own strengths, and there are a couple reasons to support my claim. The student may not have the money to do so, it may be out of their comfort zone, and lastly they may not have enough time, and forcing them to participate in an activity would bring stress onto their shoulders.        ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
502A32AFDB6A,"Generic_Name used to be shy, but he joined basketball after school and made a lot of new friends and became so much more happier and gained a lot of confident as well. I agree that students should participate in an extracurricular activities because students can play sports they enjoy, get homework and tests done, and meet new people.

Most students like to pick sports as their extracurricular activity because it is fun and students get to pick the sports they like the most such as basketball, soccer, volleyball, football, and floor hockey. Doing sports as your extracurricular activity can help you get into better shape and physically stronger. Students are usually stressed and want to go to bed after school but going out to run or playing a game can force their brains wake up. Playing sports can help with your sleeping because you've used up all your energy and in the morning you will wake up felling refreshed and energized.

We all have subjects were good and bad at and need more help than others. Staying after in a homework club or with a teacher can make a huge difference to your learning and your understanding. If you stay after with a teacher they can help you one on one and talk to you through your work step by step, and it will show your teacher that you are willing to try and it will motivate the both of you to put an effort in. When you miss a day or two because you were sick it can be hard to catch up on all the work you've missed and the teacher can't sit with you one on one during class because they have to teach a new lesson to the class, so staying after can give the teachers a chance to sit with you one on one so they can help you catch up. We all take tests but sometimes we don't have enough time to finish or had a hard time with the test and need more time but you can't miss your next class, but you can stay after and finish the test and refresh your memories and go over the notes you have. Staying with a homework club can let you work on work with your friends you are struggling with and work on group projects together.

Staying after in a club is a good idea because you can do activities you like to do such as art, chess, book club, computer arts, and music class. Some of the clubs may not be something you can have as your classes and you really enjoy doing them. When you stay after you can pick which activity you want to go to. Going to these clubs will allow you to meet new people with the same interests with you and you'll have something to talk about, you can make a lot of new friends too.

Having an extracurricular activity is good to be in and can benefit you in many ways. An activity that is enjoyable for most people is sports because you can play any sport you want and it can help get your energy out. Staying with a teacher can be helpful in many ways but it can help you get a better understanding, get tests done, missing assignments, and can help get you grade up. Another way extracurricular activities can benefit is you is that you can make new friends and enjoy classes that aren't always available to you. In conclusion I agree that students should have an extracurricular active they enjoy because it can help then get into better shape, get homework and tests completed, and to make friends in classes that are fun and exciting. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A2E13A686051,"After school,most students go home and watch TV ,take naps,or be on there phone for multiple hours,I agree with this new decision because it gives students a chance to stay after school with there friends to get physical activity, and interact with other students.

Without this new decision students may not show interest in extracurricular activities, and many people will not sign up. It is important that this decision was made because students would not sign up on there own.

An option that students have when they sign up is after school sports. After school sports are important because it is where most students get physical activity other that PE. Not only do students get physical activity but they also learn how to stay healthy and fit, and they start developing habits of exercise. Students also learn how to work with there team to advise plans or solve issues. Working as a team can be helpful to some students because they have each other to back them up and point things out that the other person did not realize.

Another option that students have, is to serve in the student council. The student council can be helpful to some people, because it teaches you valuable skills. Some skills the student council teaches you is to be responsible and trust worthy. Students who are a part of the student council are tying to make there school a better place, and they often have people counting on them so they have to be trust worthy and accountable. That can teach students as well because they know that they are being counted on and they have to step up.

In conclusion, I agree with the principles decision because students will get a chance to stay after school with there friends to get physical activity,interact with other students and learn to help there community.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
B4C4BABFB290,"Recently the principle made a big change to our school. He decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. After I heard about this, I started thinking of how this can impact our school. Some students might disagree with this new change, but I actually agree with the principle's decision. There might be some minor ways on how this can effect students, however, I think this could be a great way to improve students mental health. Students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity because this could make students more productive, help students find something they might be passionate in, and have a great way to make new friends.

The first reason why I agree with the principle is because it can make students more productive after school. There are many students who can get lazy when they come home from school. Most of the time, I can be one of those students. Usually when I come home after school, I always get the urge to jump on my bed and just watch videos on my phone. When I get on my phone, I can get so invested in it, that I don't even realize I have a lot of homework assignments to do.

Being lazy is just unhealthy for your body and mental health. Most students probably have been in the same situation as me. Although, if those students were to be in a extracurricular activity, they would be more productive. For example, an activity like playing soccer can help someone's brain/and body to be more active. Another example would be participating in any art-related activity, which can help students think more creatively. Doing any extracurricular activity would be way better than to sit down and watch on a device. To sum up, extracurricular activities are a good way to help someone have a productive task to do.

The second reason why I agree with the principle is because extracurricular activities can help some students find something to be passionate in. There are some students who might not have any activity or hobby they're passionate in. If those students had to take an extracurricular activity, they would have a more chance of finding something they like. Some students might even end up liking an activity they never thought they would. Every school gives many options in extracurricular activities. If a student tries out an activity and they don't like it, they can always try a different one. Also, another benefit in finding a activity you like, is getting a lead to a career you might want to have in the future. It's always good to know what you're passionate in, so you can have more options for future careers.

The final reason why I agree with the principle is because joining in extracurricular activities can be a great way to make new friends. Socializing and making friends is important for anyone's mental health. Friends can be supporting and a helping hand at any time. The friends you make can also build a strong character in you. If you join an extracurricular activity that you really like, it can be easier to make friends because they will have the same interest as you. Because of the similar interests, the friends you make through an activity can be more closer than the friends you make in class. Making friends gets you to know other people in your school, and it's better to know more people so you can feel more comfortable at school. All in all, extracurricular activities can be the best opportunity in making great friends.

There may be other ways that extracurricular activities can benefit students, but the reasons I thought of were the most important to me. With extracurricular activities students can be more productive, find an activity they might be passionate in, and make new friends. Also, extracurricular activities can play a important role in life by leading you to a career. For the students who don't agree in partaking in any activity, just keep in mind that It's always better to try new activities because you might end up liking it! ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
77EC35543BBE,"Imagine if your principal told you that all students will have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Would you agree or disagree? I think I would Agree with the principal. My three reasons why are; exercise, socialization, and having something else to do.

When I say exercise, I don't just mean physically. Exercising the brain is something many different clubs do. Even football and basketball require a sharp brain to be able to make strategies and avoid obstacles. Chess club is another great way to exercise your brain. But you can also be exercised physically by extracurricular activities. swim teams, soccer teams, and other sports teams are all great ways to bet kept active.

In this day and age, sometimes it is hard to be social. Electronics and social media take up our time and we can't talk to others like we used to. Being in a club, however, you can talk and have fun with others your age. No distractions except for what you are doing in that certain club. People could give you tips on how to improve, or vice versa.

Some students,after school, dont have anything else to do when they get home, setting aside chores, eating, and sleeping. Being in a extracurricular activity would give these students something to do and somewhere to be. So instead of them being couch potatoes at home, they could be outside running drills, having meetings, or even having a game/ performance.

What would you do if your principal told you that from now on, you had to participate in an extracurricular activity. Would you agree or disagree? If I were put into this scenario, i would agree with the principal. the reasons why are; exercise, being social, and having other things to do.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
4D1A2D62BDC4,"Today kids are nowhere near as social, productive, or getting as much exercise as they used too, but a principle has come up with a new plan to get kids involved again. By requiring students to involve themselves in a extracurricular activity that has many benefits in place for them.

Since the rise of gaming and social media many kids have scaled back on hanging out with their friends or going to social events like teen night, because they would rather sit at home on their phones or watch YouTube. I think it would be a huge improvement if kids had to do an extracurricular activity. Kids that do extracurricular activities could make new friends that have the same interests as them. Because what if there is a kid who is shy and really wants to play basketball but he has nobody to play with or feels he will have nobody to talk to but now the school starts having all the kids do an extracurricular activity and he joins the basketball club and make lots of new friends that he can now hang out with and play basketball with.

Therefore kids are not getting outside enough or being productive with their time if kids do at least one extracurricular is kids today with all these electronics are not being as productive as they should be. With an extracurricular activity kids could be outside because there could be a gardening club where kids could help plant flowers or tress and learn everything about how to keep a healthy garden they would also be out in the sun getting vitamin C which is great for the body where as a large number of kids sit inside and watch TV or play video games in a dark room with a bright screen flashing at them constantly which is not good for the brain nor the eyes

My next reason in why I support the idea is because kids today are not getting enough exercise as they should be instead they sit at home. If kids were required to do an extracurricular activity such as a running cub where they could track how much they run and for how long kids could track their exercise and then try to improve with more challening thing like maybe they run for longer or mabe they do the same workout on the track but after they go and run hills.

In conclusion I think kids should be required to do a least one extracurricular activity to help with social skills, increase productivity time, time outdoors or getting exercise. I believe this is a great opportunity for students to try new things and trying something even if it ends up not being you thing isn't going to hurt anything. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

But the other student they dont like to do any of that but they are being focus to do stuff.

250A3F61B6D8,"My principal has decided to make a rule to where all students must participate in a extracurricular activity.

I agree they should, the students can join a student council.

They can get more involved in school, they can make their selves more known in school, and it can be better later in life.

If going by the better later in life example, it will look good on college and job applications.

If the students were to get in a extracurricular activity, student council for example, they would get more involved in school.

They would know all thats going on in their school. Students could help out their peers if they need to know something important.

They can also help in school fundraisers or maybe if the school helps out Children Hospitals or homeless shelters they can help out them as well.

Getting more known is also a plus for some people.

It gives the students more opportunities to do things for their school and outside of their school.

If more teachers know about the students and all they do for their school they would most likely recognize those students. Outside of school you could also get well known for do the right things an helping out people and being that person that everybody should be to help out.

Joining a extracurricular activity can also be better for the students later in life.

College applications is a good example, if you want to go to a certain college then you need the grades for it and if they see that you have been in a extracurricular activity then they will look at you a little more.

Another one is job applications, it's the same as the college applications almost.

When you apply for a job and they take your job application and they see that you have participated in a activity like student council they will want you to be there because they want somebody who will be a leader and not be a follower.

Joining a extracurricular activity can be beneficial.

So I agree with my principal on making a rule where the students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The principal is trying to help their students out if they take their advice they can go a long way in life. They can get into their favorite college and get their dream job.

So just take your principals advice they are really trying to help you out.        ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
93F0E3B4826D,"The principle deciding that you have to do an extracurricular activity is like your parents choosing clothes for you and then they say that you have to wear them. Most people don't want to participate in extracurricular activities because they already have too much to do and they don't have the time. I disagree with the principle because students may have other things to do outside of school, there may not be anything that interests the students, and the students may already have other activities that they participate in.

One reason I disagree is because students could have other things to do outside of school. The students could be babysitting their siblings, doing homework, hanging out with friends, or the may have a part-time job to earn money. For example, my older sister couldn't participate in extracurricular activities because she had to babysit me and she had her own homework to do. Sometimes my sister hung out with her friends, as well. Babysitting requires attention of the sitter, and doing homework takes concentration.

There may not be anything that interests the student. Some activities could be limited and may only be there for a few days. In some schools there are things like that. There's an after school activity that you could go to and it's not there for more then a few days. One of my friends went to an activity and the day after she was happy and sad at the same time. She told me that there was a new club there and that it was really fun. She then added on and said that it's only there for two more weeks. She didn't go to after school, unless a teacher asked her to be there.

Another reason is that the student could already have other activities that they participate in. The student could already have sports to play, like soccer, basketball, baseball, or football. They could also be on one of the schools sport team and could already be there for the training. For example, I have a cousin and he is in high school. He is also on the schools soccer team and he has to be stay after school everyday for two hours. Once he gets home, he does his homework, eats, and then goes to bed. So, he doesn't have the time or energy for extracurricular activities.

In conclusion, having to do extracurricular activities is not a good idea. Students have other things to do, they may not like what choices they're being offered, and they may already have activities that they are participating in. The principles decision is like your parents choosing clothes for you because it may be nice, but you don't want it. You may be happy about it in the beginning but then you realize that you didn't have a choice in the matter. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
D343F253FDE8,"School has many extracurricular activities. Such as sports, clubs, councils, and more. Although these activities sound amusing and fun, some kids might not like it or find any interest in them. Maybe they want to go home or hang out with friends like a pack of wolves. I disagree with the decision of making students participate in after school activities because some kids wouldn't be interested, they may have other things to do, and they want to have time to spend with family.

When some kids do sports or other activities, they may start to lose interest. Take Basketball or Football for example, most kids and adults love playing or watching the sport on TV. But to some kids when they play or watch it, the interest in that sport will start to go away because of the repetition that's going on in the game. The reason behind this is because kids find other things for amusement. For instance, art. Art gives kids the ability to let their imagination run free and create wonderful pictures and ideas for a comic or art picture. Plus, kids can have fun with drawing instead of staying at school longer for an activity that has no interest to them.

Most of the time students have backpacks that are filled with homework and are expected to complete it by tomorrow. The problem with that is most students are participating in an after school sporting event or have something else going on, which will make the student to feel stressed. Feeling stressed occurs when a child or adult starts to panic due to the time they have and how much work they are required to do. Because of the amount of homework they have, some students will stay up through the night in order to complete the work for the day. Also, due to the students staying up at night working on homework, they don't get the required sleep that a person needs to have before the next day. Which is why some students don't want to do extracurricular activities, they want to get the homework out of the way so they can do whatever they want for the rest of the day.

Kids want to try to spend as much time as they can with their family all the time. whether if they have a little bit of homework or it's a free day. Because most parents are working people and have to travel most of the time, so when the kids get off the bus to go home, they're most likely to be home alone because their parents are still working. Or they are out running errands before they get home. Plus, when the kids get to their parents after a long day, they to try and spend as much time as they can before the parents' children become teenagers and leave the house for college. Like a life cycle of a duck, the baby ducks try to stay with their mommy before they grow into adult ducks and go out on their own.

I disagree with the decision of making students participate in after school activities because some kids wouldn't be interested, they may have other things to do, and they want to have time to spend with family. Students should be able to choose if they want to take part in an after school activity or not participate in one. Students of all ages have their own interests and other activities they find amusing. Because everyone is different, have different ideas, and do different things on their free time. In conclusion, students should be able to choose if they want to do an after school activity or not and not have a requirement of doing an extracurricular activity.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
8B495F122E5B,"Many schools offer extracurricular activities for students to participate in. An extracurricular activity is a club, team, or other group that meets before or after school, such as playing football or acting in the school's musical. If my principal were to require each student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I would agree with his decision because it would teach students about responsibility, students would have more opportunities to make friends, and it could benefit their college applications.

Extracurricular activities can teach responsibility because they often have deadlines, meetings, and things that must be turned in. Being responsible is necessary to function as a human, especially if you are part of a club or team. If you miss a deadline, you could face getting removed from the group. If you skip a meeting, you may miss important information, and if you forget to turn in money, you probably won't be able to participate in the next big event. Children must learn how to be responsible at a young age, and extracurricular activities are a great way to teach it.

Having friends in school is crucial for a child. Children need to have someone to talk to, play with, and trust. When you participate in an extracurricular activity, it opens the door to making new friends. Students are more successful if they have someone to relate to, and if their friend is also in the same club, they have something to bond over. It is important for children to form friendships within their after-school activities because they will want to be more active in the group.

All throughout school, children are told to plan for their future. They are told to decide which college they are going to go to, and then do everything they possibly can to get there. Many students use extracurricular activities on their college applications, because it can set them apart from other students. If you played football throughout high school, you may be able to get a scholarship. Students who were on academic teams may have a better chance at getting into college. Extracurricular activities are very beneficial for college applications, and could make the difference when it comes to getting in.

Teaching responsibility, forming friendships, and bettering your chances of getting into college are just three of the reasons why I would agree with my principal's decision of requiring each student to participate in an extracurricular activity. With so many options, it wouldn't be hard for everyone to find something that they could enjoy. Students may enjoy and appreciate school more if there was a club they enjoyed there. Extracurricular activities are helpful and important for students.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
FA480C1038D5,"Would you like to lose the ability to choose what you do in your daily life? Well, most people would not enjoy losing their given right to decide, and that applies to students as well. Participating in an extracurricular activity has been a choice for the longest time, and it is unjustifiable to force students to engage in such tiring activities. It wouldn't make anyone enjoy school more, it would actually do the opposite, It would tarnish the awful reputation that most schools have and would justify the claim that schools are nothing but a large road block holding kids back. Thats why I disagree with mandatory extracurricular activities, extracurricular activities should always be a choice, and not forcibly be laid upon an individual, it would ruin the palpable relationship between school and students, and it would dramatically increase stress in a school environment.

Firstly, students would have to endure the retched activities that they don't enjoy, and it would tire these kids out to the point which they collapse on bed whenever they would return home, reducing the amount of time we have to work on projects, homework, and other things alike. This, in theory, would increase stress by a staggering amount. Oh, and have I mentioned that most students struggle to wake up and arrive to school at time? Well, having mandatory extracurricular activities would increase the amount of time an individual takes to sleep, making it even harder for us students to arrive on time. Multiple studies have also shown a connection between grades and sleep. This could mean the school getting lower and lower test scores which would be devastating to everyone involved.

Secondly, it would make students dislike our school more than they do already. it would also massively tarnish the awful reputation of schools and promote the rumor that a school is nothing but a massive nuisance to students. Considering the condition and cleanliness of our gym and field it's no wonder why they're both the center of mockery here. It's not hard to guess that extracurricular activities would also contribute to an increase in homework, as P.E already gives out homework and projects which can take up to weeks to complete. In short having mandatory extracurricular activities would tarnish the schools reputation by a wide margin and increase the amount of work both Teachers and Students do, and promote the false narrative that school is just a large road bump.

Lastly, I wish to reiterate that extracurricular activities are choices, and not privileges. You may think that extracurricular activities would make students more happy and fit, but no sir, it would instead be another factor contributing to the mockery of our school. The education system should always be seen with respect, but extracurricular activity and other unwanted principles of school is turning it into a source where people poke fun at. If mandatory extracurricular activities are retracted, it would promote individuality and open up more choices in an increasingly unique world. What makes school special isn't friends, classes, or teachers, it's the ability to choose, just like how we chose what classes to take, or choose what to eat on lunch, taking whats special to us is simply outrageous and unethical.

In conclusion, the decision to impose mandatory extracurricular activities is a massive mess up on the schools part, and it is an awful part of school that takes away our right to choose and inflicts a large amount of stress and anxiety upon the student. Extracurricular activities would also be used to mock our school and make kids dislike school more and more. I hope you understand now Mr. Principle. Reversing your decision would be the most plausible and well received decisions amongst the student community. Now, I'd like to ask, would you enjoy having your choices taken away? I believe the correct answer for all of us would be, no.            ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
CBC0F741B812,"Not everyone can attend school, do homework, and hang out with friends and family all in the same day. Sometimes us students need a break. We attend a lot of things outside of school, and we attend school itself. Shouldn't that be enough? Well not exactly according to my principal. My principal has decided that every student in my school should participate in an extracurricular activity. But why should we have an extracurricular activity to add to our day, when we already take part in so much? I disagree with my principal for these three reasons, we need our free time, we already attend activities outside of school, and it will overly stress students.

School is difficult for many students, but to some it's easy. No matter if it's easy or difficult every student needs a bit of free time in there life. If we added extracurricular activities to our everyday lives, we would end up with so little free time that we would call it a break. Without free time to do what you want, you would probably die of boredom. Free time gives you time to do things that are under your control, just make sure not to break a law. For example you can go outside and play basketball, but you can change up the rules and make it your own game. In school you can't make your decisions or your rules, it is all based on your principal or teachers rules. It's like when you're writing an essay, instead of letting you write it your own way, your teacher will give you specific rules you have to follow while writing it. However, in your free time you can make your specific rules that make your game and day more enjoyable. My principal doesn't understand that outside of school we have lives, and free time helps our lives become more fun.

Not only do I care for free time, I also care for my soccer team that I attend after school. Students don't only need free time they also need time for activities like sports, clubs, etc. Now the only reason I'm disagreeing with my principal is because he/she said I must attend an extracurricular activity. Some students don't have a club or sports team to attend, so an extracurricular activity would be a great idea for these people. It should be an optional activity to attend not mandatory. The soccer team I'm on at the moment is really great because it allows me to spend time with friends. It is also a great help with exercise and staying outdoors. It is very competitive, and in the end whether you win or lose your still having fun out there no matter what.

School and homework itself causes students stress, if you were to add another activity for school, students would stress even more. We have a lot of things to do in our everyday lives such as, attending school, doing homework, spending quality time with friends and family, and attending sports teams. All these activities add up to hours and hours of your day. School is 6 hours and 45 minutes, homework will take you 1-3 hours, and sports practices are usually 1 hour and 30 minutes. You never know how much time you're going to spend with friends and family. Not only that but you need free time and sleep! To add an extra activity to all of that would just be absurd. You would be falling apart at the end of the day if you had to fit in time for an extracurricular activity. Repeating this until the weekend would just be absolutely miserable.

In conclusion, students think that they already have enough activities in there everyday lives to add more. If we were to add more to the day it would just be unnecessary and more stressful for students. I think my principal should change mandatory to optional. You might have things going on outside of school that are more important then making a yearbook look nice. I even think students shouldn't take part in homework, because even that is stressful. So why should we have an extracurricular activity to add to our day, when we already take part in so much? I disagree with my principal for these three reasons, we need our free time, we already attend activities outside of school, and it will overly stress students.                    ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
08CE03D82736,"Most of the time when a student comes back from school they go home and relax, procrastinate and maybe do their homework; this is most students, but not all. Extracurricular activities can either be fun and exhilirating or dull and exhausting; it all depends on what the student enjoys doing. If a student loves to move around all the time, they don't want to just sit around and do nothing. Student's that enjoy wasting thier time doing unnecesary things, suffer from it. If someone was to be placed with their friends doing something that they usually wouldn't do, they would do it, because that is the influence your friends have on you. If your friends like to skip class, you are eventually going to skip class. If your friends are excellent in school, you will be excellent in school. I agree with making sure everyone has atleast one extracurricular activity because it would help students do something productive instead of wasting their time doing nothing; it would give students motivation to stop procrastinating and finish their work on time. Colleges also look at your extracurricular activities so it would definitely help the student trying to get into college. I also believe that this will be good for some of the students with mental health issues and it could reduce stress.

Extracurricular activities would help students do something productive, instead of wasting their time by making sure that they alsways keep themselves busy and get them to understand that you can never get time back, once it's gone, it's never coming back, so they should do something productive with it that will help them in the future. Hopefully they can teach those students, to do something now, that your future self will thank you for. Extracurricular activities can help students overcome their struggles, for example; if a student who procrastinates took joined a club for time management they would learn ways to finish their work on time and not worry about overdue assignments. In order for students to succeed in school and be succesfull in the future, there are certain obstacles they must overcome in order to succeed; hopefully extracurricular activities can do just that.

For the students trying their hardest to get into college, your GPA and SAT scores are not the only thing Colleges look at. Colleges and Universities want to see the kind of person you are, otherwise we're all just numbers; what that means is, if Colleges see that someone was on the student council or was the president of their club, they are going to be impressed by it, because it shows that that person has leadership skills, and colleges need leaders, not followers. There has been numerous occasions when an average studeent that participated in activities got accepted by their dream college as opposed to an excellent student that never participated in activities and got declined by the college they applied to; why? Because colleges can't see the type of person you are and what skills you possess based off of test scores and how well you did on an assignment, a letter does not define you. Just because someone did well on a test than another doesn't mean they are better than the other. The way the schooling system works is like a puzzle some students fit in that puzzle, others don't.

Extracurricular activities with friends is fun and exhilirating; your friends make you laugh and make you happy, happiness releases dopamines to your brain that that puts you in a wonderfull mood. However not everyone has friends and not everyone has social skills. Those that are socially akward, can create a club and learn how to talk to poeple so they can make friends. Clubs, and sports are all extracurricular activities that involve others and the more you hang around a person the more comfortable you are around them the easier it is to talk to them and become friends . People will mental health issues or have stress from school can go to their extracurricular activity to relax and have a good time. As it states in paragraph two, extracurricular activities helps people finish their work so they don't have to stress about it therefor reducing stress levels., dopamines reduce depression and anxiety; furthermore mental health issues don't become as big as an issue as it was before.

I agree with making sure everyone has atleast one extracurricular activity because it would help students do something productive instead of wasting their time doing nothing; it would give students motivation to stop procrastinating and finish their work on time. Colleges also look at your extracurricular activities so it would definitely help the student trying to get into college.

I also believe that this will be good for some of the students with mental health issues, it could also reduce stress. Student's that procrastinate and waste their time, have friends that do the same. They can meet new people with better habbits and join clubs to help overcome that so they can better their performance in school. Hopefully they can teach those students to do something now, your future self will thank you for. As for Colleges, they want to see personality, otherwise we're all just numbers, and colleges don't want numbers they want bright people. If you show leadership skills in clubs or sports, colleges will be impressed by it, because colleges need leaders, not followers. As for mental health, friends make you laugh and make you happy, feeling happy releases dopamines to your brain that that puts you in a great mood. Extracurricular activities helps people finish their work so they don't have to stress about it therefor reducing stress levels, dopamines reduce depression and anxiety so mental health issues don't become as big as an issue as it was before.

B0F17397621A,"Some ways to success can start when your young. I believe extracurricular activities should be incorporated in all kids schedule. After school clubs such as political clubs and science clubs help students think creatively giving them advantages in those subjects. Extracurricular activities also help guide people down their paths. These programs are giving kids extra knowledge in things they want to learn about, like math. NFL players like Aaron Rodgers did extracurricular activities like football to learn the game and he used those skills on his path, and now he is in the NFL. Although these activities can be time consuming and take away homework time from other classes, that is a small price to pay for something that can help your future so much. Like Aaron Rodgers said ""Put in work now to have a better future later.""In conclusion extracurricular activities can teach valuable lessons and help people with their future.

If you have free time and are looking to learn, extracurricular activities could be for you. They give you something to do at times that you could be bored. They have you learning at all times. These activities tend to boost your confidence. Learning about an activity giving you more experience in it causes some people to feel more confident when talking about that activity. Even if your playing a sport, your learning about the sport. These activities set you up with knowledge and guide you down the path of success. In conclusion extracurricular activities cause success and confidence.

Extracurricular activities can help kids build friendships. These actives help kids meet peers with common interest. This also allows the chance for these kids to learn teamwork which is a valuable skill in the real world. This can create an environment where kids might feel comfortable and be able to share their feelings with trusted adults or friends. With some of these activities like sports, this allows kids to get their needed sixty minutes of exercise everyday. In conclusion I believe that extracurricular activities should be incorporated into every kids schedule. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
0411473808DC,"I disagree with the principal making all students participate in a extracurricular activity.

I disagree with this idea because it comes with many cons.

I feel like students should make their own decision if they do a extracurricular activity or not.

Because if you force them to do so they might not put as much effort into it as if they choose to do it.

For example some students are not into things like joining the yearbook club because it may not interest them to take pictures of things and or people.

Students may also not be into student council because it does not catch their attention to do that type of thing.

The principal making all the students do a activity is a bad idea because conflict could start this way.

For example a fight could break out and it would be hard for the teachers to break it up because there is too many students.

There is many things to think about like is there enough teachers to run the class because some teachers may have to leave or do not want to stay after school for an activity.

Another thing to think about is what kind of activities would you have for all the students that interest all of them.

One more thing to think about is not having activities that interest some kids an example would be chess club.

Some kids are not interested in that and or do not know how to play chess or girls who code.

Because some girls tried to code and do not understand it or just do not like it.

Last but not least kids who do not want to be there may act up and prohibit other boys and girls from learning.

Which may lead to constant distractions to others and may disturb other classes.  ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
63B4820B55F7,"Imagine living in a world where children were healthier and adults actually cooperated well. It almost seems perfect right? Well, this is what our society could look like in the future if students were required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students should be obligated to be involved in at least one after school activity because the child would be healthier, more social, less stressed, and more disciplined.

Extra curricular activities, such as playing sports, can benefit the student's well being. The child would be kept in shape and would be more physically active. Keeping the child healthy could benefit him or her in the future by adding to the child's life span. Sports will also decrease the high obesity cases in our country. Obesity is a common issue in America due to the millions of fast food places and the limited exercise options. If the younger generations were forced to exercise, Americans would be more healthy and fit in the future. Students will not only be getting physically healthier, he or she will also become more mentally stable. Mental health is a common issue for children due to the excessive workload and pressure that school forces onto us; sports will provide an escape for the students. These are just a couple of the reasons why students should be obligated to be involved in at least one activity after school. The child will be healthier, happier, more mentally stable, and our obesity issues will decrease in our country.

Some might argue that the students will be overwhelmed with extra activities but I strongly disagree. After-school activities will provide an escape for the child from the real world. Activities such as a book club, yearbook club, and a sports team can all provide different environments for a student to go to when feeling stressed from school or his or her life at home. The student will also learn to have a better work ethic, as well as a better understanding of discipline and cooperation. The student would not get stressed from these activities because the child would be too focused on improving him or herself.

After-school activities will also help the child be more social. Being in different clubs or sports teams will expose the child to more social interactions, which can benefit his or her social life with friends and family. The student will also learn how to work better with other people in the community. This can help the community cooperate better and will improve the lives of many people. After-school activities will prevent the student from experiencing social isolation aside from school interactions with teachers or other students. He or she will learn to be a contributing member to the world. The student will be more disciplined which will help future work places run smoother. These are just a couple more reasons why students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. The child will be social, more of a team worker, and a better person in the society.

All in all, requiring students to be involved in any form of an after school activity can strongly benefit the student and society in the future. The students will be much healthier, more socially active, and the student will also develop a work ethic and learn self discipline. The society will also benefit from the involvement of students in extra activities because the child will grow up to be a cooperative and disciplined adult/ worker.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
233B42867340,"Do you thing a full time hard working student should have another activity piled on top of all of the other things we do? well it think no you should not have to do anything extra. Nobody should be forced or be expected to do something that does not benefit them self. You can't always please everyone by doing something extra. If you spend all your time doing things for your school you will have no tome for yourself. Some people will come and some people will go off and do their own stuff so there really is not a point in doing that if people just dont show up.

However, some people will agree with doing an extra activity, some people will disagree because of the following reason, many teens play the ""mother"" or ""father"" role in the household. They provide the money by working after school and the cook and clean. If you add another activity when will they have the time to do any of that?

If you have aver cooked ant cleaned at the same time you will know how stressful it it and weather or not they like it. Just think about it, why would you add more stress to a teenagers life?

If any school in the world would make that a new rule I hope someone would stop it. I dont want to make it seem like its the worst thing in the world but I will say its probably not the best thing to add to a teens schedule. Maybe if it was a homework club that you could choose to go to and all of you teachers would be there to help you and help you get a better understanding on work and maybe your siblings could attend also to just get a taste of middle school or highschool is like. I think that schools should also offer something like a free block that students can visit other teachers during the school day.

In conclusion, I dont really agree with making kids do something outside of school. I would like to know the outcome if you dont participate in any out-of-school activities. It seems to cause too much trouble. If any school is considering on doing it maybe the the students advice and ask them if they think it is a good idea or take a vote. Maybe try it for a few months and find out if the school can enforce the discipline and how many people actually attend. If any school decides to do this just do a ""trial run"" to see how it works.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
6BF660314A53,"Many students participate in activities outside of school, youth groups, sports teams, clubs and lots more. Some schools that are fortunate to have enough funding for school activities, like clubs or sports teams, usually provide it for their students. Many times the students are provided these programs free of charge. Lots of students take the clubs and teams for granted, and dont realize how lucky they are to have so many activities for them to access. Schools provide all sorts of different clubs for all sorts of interest groups. Sometimes you can even form your own club. School-funded activities are usually very inclusive and invite and encourage everyone who is interested to come and try it out. I believe that it would be beneficial for every student to participate in an extracurricular because they help form a sense of belonging, and when students interact with others that share some of the same interests, they are more likely to form bonds and strengthen their social skills. In addition, they are a good use of time and can help kids stay out of trouble.

When kids go straight home from school, many times they find that they have completed their homework and are bored with nothing to do. They might go sit on their couch eat food and watch television. Or they might make an unsafe decision about what to do,and end up doing something unlawful or harmful to themselves, such as smoking drugs or vandalizing public property. Extracurricular activities provide tons of clubs or teams that include lots of physical activity, like running, and playing a sport or game. Even if students are just walking, that's still a lot healthier than sitting on a couch, snacking on chips. Studies have proven that when kids who are in an extracurricular activity are at less risk of incorporating themselves with gangs. School activities are very helpful towards students who have lots of free time. They are beneficial for students health and make sure kids stay out of trouble by taking up extra time.

Some students have a hard time finding a group of friends, and might not have the courage to make themselves vulnerable to people. School-provided activities invite students to go to clubs that focus on a common interest, like math, science, art, soccer, theater, film, or video games, and many more depending on the school. If students choose to attend club they can find friends based on common interests. They might meet someone and realize that they have a class with them. When students consistently attend a club they will get to know their peers and teacher or teachers there, which will create a friendly environment. Therefore forms a sense on belonging for the students there. Some clubs work on a group activity such as a film, play, or piece of artwork(etc.). Working together as a team can lead to feelings of accomplishment and pride. Students should be required to attend at least one extracurricular activity because they are more likely to make friends, and form a sense of belonging in that club, which is very healthy for teens especially.

When students attend an activity, they have a chance to exercise their social skills, by communicating with others, which can help them become more successful with jobs, meetings, group work, and more. Students today spend lots of time on their phones, computers or other electronic devices. they communicate through snap chat, text, face time or calls. But many kids lack the social skills needed in as group environment. Extracurricular activities encourage students to talk and communicate with their peers in a group environment. Communication is very important for future jobs, meetings, and auditions. Being able to communicate and work in a team is a big trait that companies look for when they hire people. So building communication skills will benefit students in the long term and help them become successful individuals.

I agree that every student should be required to take part in at least one extracurricular activity because more students would be using their time wisely and staying out of trouble, the clubs would build a sense of belonging for students, and help students build communication skills that will help them all throughout their lives.

students will feel a welcoming environment in the club that they choose and will be happier knowing that they have made a few friends. Students will build success- bound skills of communication during clubs that will help them in high school and college.

You are defeated knowing you really wanted to play a sport but now you dont know how you will be able to do an extracurricular activity. I think we should not force students to do at least one extracurricular sport because a lot of students will be cut, many students will be stressed and not have time, and not everyone has the ability or equipment.

I think that we shouldn't make every kid do an extracurricular activity because many students will be cut. If all kids have to do a activity after school a lot of kids will be trying out for sports. If theres a student who really want to play but gets cut because someone better who doesn't want to play gets to play wouldn't be fair. Also having so many students trying to play a sport or just having to expand teams would also be chaotic and difficult to manage. Therefore we should not make every student do a extracurricular activity after school.

secondly not all students like sports or band. There are many students who dont like after school activities or they already do one but not related to school. there are also kids who are not able to play sports or activities from being disabled or not able to walk. Even though kids could do a sport or activity doesn't mean they should. There are students who have to take care of their family and always have to do chores or dont have the money to buy themselves the equipment for the sport or activity. Also there are many students who do have to help their parents with finance reasons where it would be nearly impossible for them to add on an extracurricular activity.

This leads me to my last statement that some students dont have time to do a sport. like I said students sometimes have to be home always helping or having so much schoolwork they cant do a extra activity. Students now have close to twice as much work to get to a college than the 1900's. Kids have to bend over backwards always trying to keep up with their schoolwork. As a result it would be really hard for them to do a activity when they have so much already on their plate. Students would just be getting stressed after coming home from their after school activity when they have a lot of work waiting for them when they get home.

In conclusion I believe that they should not force students to do a extracurricular activity for these reasons. Many kids will be cut, not all kids can or have resources for it, and some students dont have time for it. For those reasons I think that it wouldn't be a great decision to make every student do one extracurricular activity.       ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
B0CCFA21F82C,"My principal says we all have to participate in at least one after school activity. I totally agree with him. One of the reasons why is so we can make more friends and be more comfortable aorund people. The reason why we need to have friends and be more comfortable around people is because friends are always a important part of a persons life. Comfort is also really important because most jobs involve people and if you're uncomfortable around people that could be a problem. One of my other reasons is because it helps you with communicaton. For example you can't always be right or get the last word. If one person feels sad and everyone else is happy it's unfair to have one person so we have to consider their feelings too. Therefore I feel like communication is very important because without it it's very hard to do group activities. The last reason why I agree with our principal is because it allows you to have fun, Having fun is very important because we are still young and still deserve to have fun doing the stuff we love with the people we love. If we aren't having any fun as a young person we most likely won't have very much fun older. Not having could lead to sadness which isn't a good thing. It also gives us motivation to get through the day because we know at the end of the day we get to do the thing we love most.

207B0FEB5BEF,"Extracurricular activities help prepare students for the real world, which is one of the major reasons students attend school. It should be mandatory for students to participate in extracurricular activities, because it would teach students time management, which is a life-skill needed in the real world. It also helps students discover their interests, and would encouraged young scholar to socialize with peers, who share common interests.

Firstly, extracurricular activities cause students to manage their time better. Students may have to balance their time between their social lives, extracurricular activities, the time they spend with family, school work, etc. Time management is essential for a successful live. For example, an individual is very intelligent, however, he/she starts their homework at a late hour, and does not have time to study for their mid-terms. As a result, that individual is very tired in the morning, and does not do as well as he/she could of on the test. Extracurricular activities would force students to manage their time better, by adding an extra layer of responsibility.

In addition, extracurricular activities would encourage students to socialize with peers that share common interest. With a large amount of stress that is put on young scholars, it is important for them to talk with individuals who are in the same position. Extracurricular actives would allow students to obtain that opportunity. Nevertheless, students can also learn from others, such as, their peers, mentors, and teachers. For example, an individual may be interested in sports. He/she has the opportunity to communicate with peers that also enjoy sports.

Furthermore, extracurricular activities aid students in discovering interests. For example, a young scholar participates in the school newspaper, that student may be interested in a profession where writing is involved, or maybe a student joins the school debate team, that student may enjoy a career in law. It is important for students to have an option when it comes to hobbies or interests, in order to be more successful. Extracurricular activities would provide that option. Extracurricular activities make it easier for students to find what they enjoy the most. This is an extremely important factor of school. A student may believe they enjoy a certain class, but when they join the class, they realize it is not for them. Extracurricular activities provide many doorways, in which students can enter or exit whenever they want.

In conclusion, making extracurricular activities mandatory would force students to manage their time better, expose students to peers that share common interests, and help young scholars discover their interests. Extracurricular activities are a part of the school experience, so students should jump on the bandwagon and discover what they enjoy.        ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
F3DE9D926591,"Do you guys like getting home and relaxing after a day at school? Do you like hanging out with your friends after school? Or do you like staying after school to do an extracurricular? I disagree with the decision because they might have homework, they wanna get home to be with there family, and they might have a sports practice or game.

If you have homework I would rather be at home doing it instead doing an after school activity. What happens if you have a study guide for homework and it's due the next day you wanna get started on it right away and not stay after school. An example was when I was in 6th and I had 2 study guides to do but I had to go to a club I was in but I decided to skip my club and do my study guides.

If i have a family member come over I rarely ever see I won't stay for the extracurricular activity. Would you rather go home and see your family or stay after for an activity? An example was when I was in elementary school and my great grandmother came to town and I had a club after school and I decided to skip because I rarely see my great grandma.

If you play sports you probably love it if you have an extracurricular activity you won't be able to go to practice or you could miss a game. I have sporting events all the time if I have practice or a game I won't go to the extracurricular activity. An example was this year in 8th grade I had a after school appointment with my science teacher but I also had a really important basketball game I told my teacher I couldn't make it and i'll make it up and she was fine with it so I went to the game.

In conclusion I disagree with the principal because nobody should have to do something they don't wanna do. I disagree with the decision because they might have homework, they wanna get home to be with there family, and they might have a sports practice or game.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
0F5247051127,"I agree that we should have to be involved in an extracurricular activity because we need to take a break from school, get involved and try new things, and so we can meet new people and develop social skills. When we are involved in something more than just school and we can develop good relationships. We also just need time just to step aside from school and do something we enjoy.

First Reason why I agree that we should be required to do and extracurricular activity, is that sometimes we need a break from school and having to do work. I know that some extracurricular activities involve school, but it's not like you're doing worksheets for an actual class. I believe that we should have an outlet. An outlet is something that helps you calm down and relax. We should have an outlet that we choose, it should be something fun, something that we like to do, and something that we won't get to stressed about. When I'm doing my extracurricular activity I feel so relieved and stress free, because I don't have to worry about any grades or school work, I can just focus on something that I like and enjoy doing. Everyone needs to have that feeling, that outlet.

The next reason why I agree is because we need to get involved in something and try something new. What I mean by getting involved in an extracurricular activity, is get involved because you what to do it, not because maybe your friends are doing it or your parents want you to do a certain sport, do it because it involves your interest and what you want to do. If you are not sure what your interest are, then try something new that sounds appealing to you. They're a lot of extracurricular activities out there that you may like. Maybe you think that a sport is right for you, and that's all you do, but you might not know that your a really good artist, because you haven't tried it so you wouldn't know.

My last reason why I agree is that you can meet new people and develop social skills. I think meeting new people is important because you need to have some people that you can count on and that can help you through something. You never know when you could meet your best friend for life. Also if you try something new and you meet new people, you develop social skills. Examples of developing social skills are like how you go up to someone and introduce yourself, or how to include someone in your conversations.

Taking a break from school, getting involved and trying new things, and meeting new people are the reasons why I agree with having every student be involved in an extracurricular activity. When you have something else than just school, you look forward to that one thing that you like doing, with new people and friends, and something that you really enjoy. That's why I think you should Agree with all students should be required to do an extracurricular activity. Don't you agree?           ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
B59796948DC5,"How do extracurricular activities make you feel when you are in one? For me they make me feel happy and good about myself. It is a chance for me to interact with people that have one or more of the same interests as me.

If my principal was to make joining an extracurricular activity mandatory I would love that. It would give others a little nudge to join a team or be part of a group doing something they enjoy. Extracurricular activities provide an opportunity to make new friends with same interests as you, contribute to your school and or get you active.

In elementary school, at Generic_School, there was a club called Green Team. This club center was building a garden for the school to use and making sure that Generic_School is as green as can be. My mom had originally forced me to be in this club (like the principal is doing now) to learn more about gardening. At first, I did not really care for what we were doing with the T-Shirt design, the research on flowers and vegetables, the measurements for the garden and some other things. Then we started talking about a compost maker and how it works. Learning the science behind it got me intrigued in gardening and I looked at it a different way, my way. Being forced to do something isn't all that bad because who knows you might end up enjoying it. When the club ended I hadn't just been part of a group doing something I like, I had made the school a better place.

A couple years after we moved here my dad made me retry lacrosse. It was Fourth grade and we moved here in second. I didn't want to do it because my experience with it on Long Island ruined it for me. He wanted me to try again because he knew I liked the sport lacrosse, just that for me to get back into the swing of things I would need a push. I went to Western Loudoun Lacrosse tryouts and was put on a team. I wasn't the best and was probably really close to being the worst, but I played the whole season. It is a good thing I didn't quit because if I had I wouldn't be friends with one of my best friends today. Now me and him do a lot of things together and I still play lacrosse.

Some kids at school just try to get through the day to just go home and play video games till they fall asleep. The principal forcing us to get active and join a club or team is what these kids need. For starters colleges don't just look at your grades and tests scores, they look at what you do outside of school too. Those kids who don't want to put themselves out there because they are too scared of failure or humiliation need a little push to get them to do something they love and is good for them too. Being required to join an extracurricular activity is a good thing to happen and should.

Being required to do an extracurricular activity has many benefits such as contributing to you school, making new friends with similar or same interests and becoming active or increasing your activity. You are just required to do one and you get to choose. You are not being forced to do an extracurricular activity you dislike. It is just one activity that you might like. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
E63713BC8E38,"Did you know that being forced to do very unnecessary things for no reason can give you cancer. This should be the end of my essay, but I guess cancer isn't reason enough for the Department of Education or whoever is grading this thing so here we go. I believe thats students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities because the school might not provide anything that interests them, they might need the time for other important things they have to do, and the principal shouldn't get to decide what you have to do outside of school and in your free time.

My first reason, besides cancer, would be the possibility that students might not find anything that they like or that peeks their interest in the schools extracurricular program. At Generic_Name, there are a lot of extracurricular activities for children to participate in, and most kids can find something that they like, key word being most. Some of the kids at Generic_Name have absolutely no interest what so ever in staying after school. Whether that may be because they dont like the activities, or if it's because somebody they don't like is in one of the only activities that they like to do, it still wouldn't be fair to them if they were forced to participate in these shenanigans for no apparent reason. And if people who don't want to participate are being forced to participate, they aren't going to care much at all for the activity, and so they aren't going to try, that in turn slows the whole operation down, which ruins it for the kids who actually do want to participate. All of it just would be unfair to a lot of people, so we shouldn't do it.

The Second reason I have is the fact that a lot of people need, and use the time they have after school to do very necessary stuff. Carrying for family members, doing chores, studying, and going to doctor appointments are only a handful of the things that many students have to do directly after school ends. Most of the students' worries aren't about being bored, it's about having enough time to do all the things you have to do, and taking away a large fraction of that time isn't exactly what you would smart. Now, imagine some eighth grader that is really struggling with math, he's bending over backwards trying to understand what the mixture of all these numbers and letters mean, he's tried to ask a teacher, but he just doesn't get the way she explains it. He tried asking his friends for help, but they don't know how to explain it either. He knows exactly who could help him, his mom. But he can't get help from his mom about all these things he has been taught through out the year, and the SOL is in a week. If only he didn't have to do all of that unnecessary work and ... Oh! would you look at that, now he has cancer. It's not like the entirety of our after school time is spent fooling around and selling drugs, we only do that half of the time.

I also understand that this idea isn't entirely fraud. It would have some benefits such as keeping kids that might get into trouble outside of school, busy inside of school, it could also build a sense of unity between the students and the school. But the way I see it, the cons very much outweigh the pros in this situation. which leads me to my final reason for why this is dumb, why should the principal get to decide what I get and don't get to do outside of school, and outside, of school hours. I am pretty sure the principal has neither the right nor the power to enforce such a thing. Me and my family should be the only ones deciding what I should or shouldn't do with my free time. Plus, it is highly unlikely that this would pass if our principal tried to turn this into a rule, so why am I even writing this.

I genuinely think that this a very stupid idea because of the fact the it will help or not affect a select group of students that are completely free after school, don't mind being in school for two more hours, or already stay after school everyday. So, you, yes you, I want you to march over to the principal's office spin his chair around and tell him he's a bad bad boy.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
D62C13D2615D,"Have you ever wanted to join a school club? Too bad if you said no because you dont get a choice! The Principal's plan is flawed and quite simply wont work. It is riddled with issues.

The main reason it will fail is because it's taking away free choice. As a result, teens will do what teens are sterotypically known to do and rebel. Many students will probably intentionally not join clubs. The majority of students enjoy going home after school and they will be angered by this plan.

There would not be enough options of activities for people to join. Everyone has different interests and some people would be forced to join clubs they don't like or even want to be in. Also, clubs might fill up faster because everyone has to join something. A kid who really likes robots and is enthusiastic about joining robotics club could be unable to join because it's full with kids who don't even care about robots.

Many students do extracurricular activities but not through school. For example, stuff such as Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts. So kids could do lots of activities outside of school and be forced to do something that takes away what little of their free time remains. The school based activity could even conflict with a student's other activities.

School clubs are a very good way to meet new friends, have fun, and learn. School clubs can even help you find your passion. However, they should be joined on one's own terms.

In summary, schools should not dictate a student's after school life. Although the principal probably has good intentions his plan could have some consequences. So, for the sake of our our free will and free time oppose the plan.                 ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
553A7E9B393C,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For example sports,work on the school year book,or serve for student council do i agree or disagree with this argument.

First off I would like to start off by saying, the principal might just want his students to have more than education. The principal just wants to have a little more fun in school instead of just sitting in side day doing boring classwork. So i should ask this, have you ever been in school and you are bored out of your mind? Well that is exactly why this principal is doing this for his students in his school.

Secondly just let me back ""up""! When your bored at your house what do you do? Well most of you would say um i play Fortnite or I play my Xbox or GTA 5 something like that. But when your at school your like please just get me out of here its so boring! So now is when im going to say that is why this school principals doing this for his student's because he dose not want his students to get bored.

Thirdly when a student gets bored they will do anything possible to not be bored. So thats what leads in to timeout slips and then it starts disrupting the class and it also stops the students from learning. So this is another reason why this principle doing this for his students. hen it gets so bad that it stops the others from learning you know its time to do something bout that. Like even some teachers have board games in their classrooms.

Fourthly that is why their are after school sports such as football,resulting,basketball,baseball,soccer,and even volleyball. But now im at the point where im deciding whether or not im agreeing or disagreeing on the argument. So im going to agree with this argument.

1C7D1F04503D,"Students who struggle in school find it to be exhausting or even stressful, but participating in extracurricular activities may change their mind. Educating students may set them up for success in the future but can also put them at a worrisome situation to finish work on time and get projects done. Students who ask questions and seek for help may be overwhelmed and have trouble understanding the concept, in this situation students need to take their mind off this and do something to relieve them of their troubles. Extracurricular activities can impact students by relieving their stress, improving a more positive mindset, and finally having a chance to make new friends.

School educates students about subjects that may be useful to have later in their lives, while this can be helpful it can also be stressful. Being in an extracurricular activity such as soccer club may gives students an opportunity to have fun and play with their friends, by doing this it can be enjoyable and take away stress from school. Although school is overwhelming sometimes, extracurricular activities make students embrace an opportunity that takes away all stress and helps them focus on exciting activities. By relieving stress the students will feel that they can achieve all the work given to them, this will boost their confidence knowing they can do anything.

Sometimes students might give up on their confidence because of all the work they have to get done. An extracurricular activity such as working on the yearbook can help students focus on an activity that helps them believe they are capable of achieving anything. Building confidence, having a better self esteem, and believing in yourself, are all important steps to having a more positive mindset, this impacts students because it helps students get their work done and doesn't have them worry about stressing out. A positive and confident mindset is one of the most important steps to achieve future goals, by being more confident anything can be accomplished.

The final reason why participating in an extracurricular activity is there will be plenty of people to work with and a chance to make some new friends. Beside all the fun and activities to do in different clubs there will also be people to work with and a chance to make some new friends. By making new friends it will improve one's mindset socially and is another way to deal with stress because when having new friends it can make someone feel happy and excited. Dealing with stress isn't an easy task, but a way to being happier is to make new friends.

School can be stressful sometimes, but with extracurricular activities the amount of stress should be decreased. Extracurricular activities such as sports clubs, working on the year book, or even serving on student council are all opportunities for students to direct their focus on having fun instead of being overwhelmed by all the work. Being positive, relieving stress, and making new friends are all effective ways to not be overwhelmed in school, instead students should embrace going to school because of all the opportunities given.  ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
C3D986A84D93,"Do you think kids should be forced to do extracurricular activities? No, I disagree with kids being forced to do extracurricular activities. Kids shouldn't be forced to do after school activities just because the principle wants them to. Kids should have the option of saying if they are going to or not. You have to see if the students are able to go without any obstacles or even if they want to do extra circular activities. There are many kids where there are issues to get to places issues of even getting permission.

First, kids come to school to learn and parents pick them up but some don't because they have to work or run errands, so the kids take the bus. Sometimes there is not a bus after school or in a regular sport. A lot of the times you need a parent or guardian to pick the student up. Picking kids up right after work can be stressful because of traffic and sometimes parents aren't even home with extracurricular actives are over. So it would be very difficult for parents and kids to go and not be able to get picked up. It would also be scary for the child, knowing that you don't know how you are going to get home. Why make it stressful for both people when you can have a choice to go.

Next, there are students who have illness, who don't have a choice to go or not. You can't force someone who is sick to do extracurricular activities. Forcing someone who has a disease or syndrome shouldn't be forced to do something that could make there condition worse then it already is. What if a student has something they don't know much about yet but they know something is wrong. You force them to be in the extracurricular activities and they get some type of bacteria or run and make everything in their system worse.

Lastly, forcing kids to do something has no impact on how they are going to feel about what is going on. Forcing kids to do things makes them want to do it less and dread what they are doing or going through. Such as forcing kids to do extracurricular activities is just making them not want to come because you can't let them pick on their own if they want to come or not. You should have kids have their say. Letting them like you and know what you are planning on doing could impact this situation a lot with just letting them have their own option.

Understanding now why kids shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities, the principle should not force these kids to do extracurricular activities. They should let the kids decide if they want to, they should figure out if their are any issues if they want to do it, and they should know if they are committed without being told to do it.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
5FB1A7C1D694,"Tim Ryan, an experienced bird watcher once said, ""In middle school, somebody started the weirdest club imaginable... a bird watching club. Being the class clown that I was, my friends and I signed up for the oddest club at school. At first, it was just funny. Then I found myself looking forward to club day. Bird watching was a ton of fun. If I wasn't required to sign up for a club, I would never have found my true passion -- bird watching."" School required extracurricular activities have been controversial for many years. Is it a waste of time? Are the activities even fun? As the years went by, many people started to realize that extracurricular activities are beneficial. Students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities because it can boost their confidence, improve their time management skills, teach them how to work with other people, and they may even find a new favorite hobby.

One of the most obvious reasons why students should participate in an extracurricular activity is because they can find a new hobby. According to a survey conducted by the Activity Observation Committee, 76% of all Generic_City students have found a new, beloved activity that was introduced to them during school. Some people have the courage to attempt a new activity on their own time, but others aren't so lucky. You may think you don't like to do something, but you truly don't know until you try it. Your future won't be resting on that activity. If you like it, then that's amazing. If not, then there is nothing to worry about. You will have tried it and then your source of dislike would be valid.

In addition, participating in an extracurricular activity can boost confidence. Generic_Name, a sixth grader from Generic_School, once said, ""I never actually thought that I would be good at a sport. However, all of my friends are good at basketball. When club time rolled around at school, I got pressured into joining the basketball club with them. It turns out that times have changed. I'm pretty good at basketball. I've been feeling much better about myself knowing that I'm good at something."" By requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, Generic_Name found that she was really good at basketball. A talent could be hidden under your surface. By signing up for a club, it can unearth that special talent. Some students may acknowledge this but are too afraid to try something new. By requiring students to sign up for an activity, the have to take that risk.

Another benefit of participating in an extracurricular activity, is that you can improve your communication skills. Generic_Name is a part of his high school's student council. Part of his job is to work with others to cultivate ideas for school programs. The council has taught him the importance of expressing his opinions and ideas. The council has made Evan much more confident about his opinions and now expresses them throughout daily life. A student council is not the only activity that can boost your communication skills. Those skills will increase anywhere that you are working together, which is usually any activity. By improving your communication skills, you are preparing for the future. You will need to be able to have excellent communication skills during college, work, and just daily life. In addition, you could make many friends. According to the Brain Like Mindedness Observation Assessments, people with the same interests typically make better friends. A club is just a bunch of people gathered together doing an activity that they enjoy. There are plenty of chances to make a friend. So next time nobody wants to join a club with you, don't worry. Once you get there you will make many friends.

On the other hand, some people claim that extracurricular activities are just a waste of time. Generic_Name, a member of her high school's softball team stated that, ""I devoted my entire life to a single sport. It was a very bad choice. I had to quit my job and I've had many sleepless nights trying to do all of my homework. Although I love softball, I should have never made this commitment.""

The only way that participating in an extracurricular activity could be a waste of time is if you aren't managing your time efficiently. Participating in activities can teach you how and why it is important to manage your time. A study conducted by the Time Management Association showed that 87% of all students that are in extracurricular activities have started to use a calendar or agenda to plan their time. Using your time wisely can be very beneficial when you have many things to get done. It can also help with not procrastinating. By knowing what has to be done and when it has to be done, you are more likely to actually do that work. This will help you prepare for what will come in the future. Your whole life will need to be planned out: when to get groceries, what needs to be done at work, when to go to the dentist, or even when to pick up a child from school. Whatever the scenario is, it is crucial to manage your time wisely. Life can get chaotic and it is important to know how to handle the chaos.

Ultimately, participating in extracurricular activities is a very beneficial from a young age. These activities can boost confidence, teach people how to work together, and improve time management skills. So, next time you have the opportunity to try a new sport or activity, go for it! You have nothing to lose and a lot to gain. Suggest clubs and activities to friends and family members. It is important to involve not only yourself, but others too. Remember Tim, the professional bird watcher? If he had never took the risk of participating in the bird watching club at his school, he would never have been discovered his true passion of bird watching. Maybe one day you will be like Tim and participate in an extracurricular activity. You never know... it could shape your future for the better.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
CF9FB3659686,"I disagree with the idea of making each student take an extracurricular activity, because adding an extra activity to a students life will just make it even more stressful they already have to deal with fake friends, sometimes parent trouble and depression due to all the work they already give at the school. Some students might also not have a parent to pick them up or drive them to the extra activity after school so those students might not take an extra curricular activity because they dont have a ride with then that would be unfair to the students that do. Student might also not find the time or have the time to focus on an extra curricular activity because they have enough going on outside the school.

They might also be lazy and not show up because they find zero interest in the extra curricular activity even if they dont have anything else to do. Some extra curricular activity you have to pay money to enter but some students dint have the money to do that extra curricular activity Research shows that students are mostlikey to do something they enjoy to do rather than being forced into the activity and sometimes the school doesnt have the activity that the student likes so they will put no effort into the activity they are forced into.

Of course the idea has pros but not that main one of them is that it will look good in college applications, but not as good as doing something outside of school without the principle telling you that you HAVE to take at least one extra curricular activity v.

1DA96102D0F1,"Have you ever been bored by the dull contents of school? Schools are normally the same everyday, which can cause one to feel as if their life is on repeat. It can feel droning and never-ending with each passing day. More often than not, children need something to break up the repetitive cycle of everyday school. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because they bring out one's talents, help one to make real friends, and give students something to look forward to.

First off, extracurricular activities can help bring out a student's talents. School is a ""one size fits all"" kind of approach, and most students don't always fit in the mold. Each kid finds interest in a different thing or skill. For instance, I took a painting class when I was in the 3rd grade. Painting is now something I do, almost daily, for relaxation and fun. Another example is, my friend Generic_Name started playing soccer when she was in kindergarten. Since then, she has become the captain of an amazing team that made it to nationals last year. Soccer is her passion and she has grown into a great player.

Second, extracurricular activities help kids make new friends. They ""funnel"" students into separate interest groups making it easier to create conversations. Kids are also able to make connections through this shared topic of interest. For instance, I play field hockey and I have to try out to make a team. At my last tryout, a seemingly nice girl approached me and asked how long I had been playing for. She started a simple conversation with a topic that we both love, and made a connection between the two of us. Another example is, my cousin plays softball and was invited to a sleep away camp. At first, she was anxious about not having anyone to talk to. After that weekend away, she came back she told me all about her new friends that she had met through this camp, doing something they all enjoy.

Lastly, extracurricular activities give students something to look forward to. School is generally not an event that students look forward to in a positive manner. Extracurricular activities can be looked forward to with a smile due to the fact that it is participated in because of the student's interests. For example, I look forward to field hockey. I love going to practices to see my friends and going to ""away"" tournaments to play with teams from everywhere. Another instance is, my little sister and cross fit. My sister recently started cross fit and she loves it. Every Wednesday, she goes and sees all of her friends and comes home with the biggest smile. On Tuesday nights she excitedly talks with my mom saying things like, ""We have to get there on time tomorrow, I almost missed the warm ups.""

In conclusion, extracurricular activities are beneficial to students in many different ways. Students can develop life long talents and passions as well as life long friends that share your interests. These activities can also be looked at like a special event to liven up one's day to day life. Extracurricular activities are interesting and still maintain the ability to brighten up any average school day.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Thirdly, this is most important because students learn more,they learn the importance of share time with friends,a lot of people have longer friendship because they like to spend time with friends and they do not spend time with a phone. All the kids should do extracurricular activities in school because this can help then in a future,especially if they take importance to improve their grades.

To conclude, every student should do activities after school,this is a benefit for their future and for their learning skills. Parents should be interest in these things because most students have bad grades in their classes and this is an opportunity for improve grades. Doing sports is an activity that can help kids to be healthy and stronger.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
29371D115009,"I agree with the principal decision about participating in extracurricular activity's. It will give the students something to do, instead of going home and doing nothing. The extracurricular activity could bring students together and create friendships. There are multiple actvity you can do such as sports, work on the year book, and serve on the student council. It will also get the student more involed with the school and make them feel more comfortable with other students. You don't need to participate in one curricular activity you could particpate in multiple activity's. It give you a chance to get better at something like sports if you have never played sports this gives you a chance to play and even get better at it. There are lots of oppurtunities that open up for you . You don't have to participate in the activity's every day. But if you do wanna come to the activity's you must particpate if not your free to go home. There will be times where you can talk with your fans and engage with others. working on your schools year book would be a nice way to connect with our students to. ",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
5B5EC31A45C1,"Should all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity? Well most school's have extracurricular activity's for their students, but the school's activities are usually optional. I think student's should at least participate in one extracurricular activity, because it will help student's to build friendship's, and have more opportunity's.

First of all while a student is doing an extracurricular activity, the student will most likely have to interact with other students. When interacting with new people, that can also lead to building more friendship's. In addition, student's that have more friends will feel more confident and will have a better social life. The students will also feel more comfortable when meeting new people and interacting with them. The student will have more people to talk to and to hangout with. When having more people to talk to will help people see different view points and different idea's.

Finally, a student will have more opportunity's with their life when doing an activity. If they join an activity that will help with high school credits. And college's look for students that can serve for them, so when doing an activity that will help college's notice you more because it will show that you can do something for that college. And you several college's might notice you and you might have to choose one, so you will have different option's to look at.

In conclusion I can that I think that all student's should do at least one extracurricular activity because it will lead to more friendships and most likely have more opportunities for that student. But student should choose what activity they can do, because they need to enjoy to be more social and be friendly to others.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
AA871DB1926F,"The bell had just gone off,students were rushing into the hallway. I stayed in the classroom waiting for everyone to leave so I wouldn't get sucked into the rushing stream that was the middle school hallway. Only after I knew it was safe did I leave. I walked down to the classroom ,happiness filling my bones,as I stepped into the class room i knew I belonged there these where my friends. I think that all people should participate in some type of extracurricular activity because I believe that,Getting students involved would help students to have something to look froward to throughout the day, getting students involved would help them make friends with people that share then same interest as them,and finale involving more student would help open so student up to a wide variety of new experiences.

The first reason is,Getting students involved would help students to have something to look froward to throughout the day. Most students have nothing to look froward to in a normal school day other than little things such as talking to your friends in between blocks or lunch,but with extracurricular activities they have something big to keep them going till the end of school. For many people,such as myself,school is a prison without bars where your forced to learn stuff that you dont want to learn,but with extracurricular activities it feels like you get a choice in what you do.

The second reason is that, getting students involved would help them make friends with people that share then same interest as them. Most student have a wide variety of friend with many different likes,hobbies,and personalty s many of which you don't have in common .Sometimes you just need someone with the same hobbies as you to talk to and what better place to find one is at a extracurricular activity about what your hobbies is!

The third reason is,involving more students would help open students up to a wide variety of new experiences. Many students are not in extracurricular activities for a variety of reasons .Joining a extracurricular activity can lead to a lot of fun doing something you never thought you would enjoy for example the FFA you could join because you wanted to try it out and new thing you know your white water rafting with your new friend wondering why you didn't sign up before you did.

In conclusion,I believe that all students should join a extracurricular activity because Getting students involved would help students to have something to look froward to throughout the day,getting students involved would help them make friends with people that share then same interest as them,and involving more students would help open students up to a wide variety of new experiences.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
C80312F1821A,"To me, having an extracurricular activity is a very important thing that I do because I have something to look forward to after having a stressful day of school. Instead of going home and doing homework, I can socialize with my friends and stop worrying about other things going on. I think if everyone in the school got that opportunity, students would be more social and be able to make new friends.

Playing sports has always been a big thing in my family because sports will keep you active and out of the house and the last thing my parents want to see is us sitting on the couch doing nothing, but having an activity will keep you busy. As the years pass, more and more children are becoming overweight, and sports provide daily exercise to prevent childhood obesity and possibly encourage better eating habits. Most sports are one team working together to achieve a common goal. This can teach young athletes teamwork and social skills that they will carry with them for the rest of their lives.

When I am really stressed out about something, I will usually put my headphones on listen to some music or go outside and play basketball or lacrosse. Doing something you enjoy will usually calm you down and relieve stress. Afterschool activities can really help if you are usually stressed about something. If sports aren't your thing, there are plenty of other activities you can do like clubs and social groups. Joining a social group will help you make new friends and find people that relate to you. Bullying is a serious thing, and something that could reduce or prevent it is a social group. Having people interact with eachother will create bonds and reduce bullying.

So if all students had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I think it would benefit the school and the community. This would provide exercise to ones who join a sports team, teach teamwork and social skills, decrease stress, help students socialize, and prevent bullying.         ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
DE762A22E874,"Do you ever see the clubs or sport teams walking around the school promoting school events? Do you ever wonder what its like? Sometimes you see the student council walking around the making sure everything is up to date. Or you may see a sport team getting ready for a game. However, it may not be so bad having extracurricular activity, who knows it may be useful, it could help with social skills, find something your passionate about, or with your grades.

Sometimes all you need in life are good social skills. Join a club and try making new friends, you could even try joining a group project. You can also step it up and be a leader of a school project. Or you can try starting your own club. Just listen to the key word and ""TRY"" something new.

However, if you do consider joining a club, make sure its a club you like. And its okay if it takes you a while to find something your truly passionate about. Its like a baby learning how to walk, it takes them a couple of times, they'll fall, but they shake it off and eventually they'll get their. Also when looking for a club its always good to try art or music, where can express yourself in anyway possible. And its okay if you don't find what your looking for.

And even if you don't want to join an extracurricular activity, at least think about your grades and how it can boost them up. Cause there's a club for everything. For example, if your failing science join a science club so it can at least help understand whats going on. Or a sports team to help boost your physical education grade. Its up to the student and how they feel about their grades.

And therefore, if all students must have an extracurricular activity whether they should or not. It can help with so much, like social skills, for making new friends. Finding something your passionate about, like art or music. Or to boost your grades if your failing any classes. All students should have an extracurricular activity.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
8D509BBA7DD5,"Touchdown! I just won the biggest game of the year. My team run on the field and we jump up and down in joy. This would not have happened if my principal did not make us take a school activity. I think that it is a good idea to make us take a school extracurricular activity. There are many ways why taking a school activity is good for you.

First it will help kids brain develop faster and it will make smarter. Then it helps you on working as a team if you are doing a extracurricular activity. Next if you don't plays any sports you will get lazy and you will not have any energy to do stuff with your friends. After It will help you on your leader ship skills the most. You never know you might like something you never tried out before.

Next you get to make new friends when you are taking a extracurricular activity. Some kids are to scared to play any sports or join in a school activity, because they are shy to talk to people. After all you get to have a lot of fun playing with your friends after school. Then it gives you a break form school, you are setting down most of the day doing work for school. When you play sports it helps you take your mind off of work and gives you brain a break.

Then it help kids that have zero friends make new ones. Next say you move on the first day you don't know anybody, a school activity help you know new kids. After the school year is over the kids will have something to do over the summer, because they know all of these kid from school activities. Next it will help kid from getting fat the more kids play sport the least likely kids will be leaving school fat. Many school sport teams are small, because there are kid that are good playing the sport but they are scared that they will get made fun of.

Finally it will open up kid to have fun in school. Next it help kid get smarter it take away kids from school and help them learned in a better way. After it works on kids team work skills and leader ship skills, which company want in they co-worker. Kids do not leaned by placing them in a room for eight hour a day for all most 1/4 of there lives. We learned more by doing school activities, it makes better kids, it make smarter kid, it helps kid learned. That is why I think that each school should have kids doing at least one school activity. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
AD447A0ADA1E,"The reason why I agree because I see a lot of people that do nothing all day. My three topics are kids need to learn more, kids need to be more athletic, and kids need to be more interactive.

I agree because if kids got to do extracurricular activites they can learn about what extracurricular activies does for you. Extracurricular activies helps kids work out and get exersize. Getting exersize is good for kids health. If kids got to work on extracurricular activies they would understaand a little bit more then what they did before.

I do not disagree because if kids got to be more athletic then kids would wanna play some sports like basketball or football. Kids would be able to do athletic things and still learn. Kids need to be more athletic because if kids are not athletic they would not wanna come to school and do the extracurricular activies. Kids come to school to have a social life and not work so if there is an extracurricular activies that give them a chance to be social and be athletic.

I agree because having extracurricular activies would be fun. havind extracurricular activies is going to be fun because everybody is going to be running around having a good time. If kids are having a good time that means that they would not mind if everybody had to do a extracurricular activies. Kids being more interactive is good because there are more willing to the extracurricular activies.

My three topics are kids need to learn more, kids need to be more athletic, and kids need to be more interactive. The reason why I put those down as my topic is because I see people all the time wishing they could have done something with their life. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
DC7A5FB980EB,"7 out of 10 students in every school participate in at least one after school activity. After school activities consist of participating in sports, helping other students out, and cleaning the school. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students have other things to do at home, some parents won't allow their children to stay after school, and students will go home later than usual.

I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students have other things to do at home. Students have to do chores, homework, take care of their siblings, they wouldn't have time to do any of these things. They will have somehow make time or do it some other day. One example of this is one day the principal told me that I had to stay after school to do a sport. Next, I called my mother telling her that I had to stay after. I tried out for track and made the team, I had forgotten that my mother wanted me to cook the chicken because she wasn't going to be home. Later that day, I went home and my mother was furious! I felt so stupid for forgetting to go home and cook the chicken that she had prepared the day before. My mom yelled at me, but she ended up forgiving me but she didn't want me to stay after anymore even if the principal made me. Another example is one day I had to stay after school to clean the floors of the hallways because my principal said the custodians needed help. What's crazy is that same day was my sister's graduation! My own self even forgot to give my mother a call telling her that I was going to stay after. I eventually finished quite fast, actually. After, I walked home and my mother was waiting for me, she asked why I came home so late and if I don't care about my sister. I was literally confused, I had no idea why she was involving my sister into this. Finally, I realized why my mother involved my sister, it was because her graduation! I apologized, and I never stayed after again. Overall, this is why I believe that the principal should not make students participate in at least one after school activity.

My second reason why I disagree that all students must participate in after school activities is because some parents won't allow their children to stay after school. Parents are very protective over their children, it was hard enough for them to let us go on our first day of school in Kindergarten; now they have to be even more cautious. One example is one day I was in English, which is my last two periods in school. The principal went over the intercom saying that there was going to be tryouts for volleyball. I really wanted to try out, being in a sport is something I always wanted to do. Also, I wanted to get into better shape. After, I called my mother asking if I could stay after school to try out and she said no. My mother and I went back and forth arguing why she wouldn't let me. Her voice started to break and she said that she's scared and she doesn't want me to. So, I didn't try out, I missed all of the try outs for volleyball. Later, my mother got a call from the principal from my school asking why she didn't let me, he overheard our conversations when I was on the phone with her. My mother kept telling the principal that she's not going to let me stay after. Lastly, I never stayed after because I knew my mother was never going to let me. Another example is one day I stayed after school because they were going to play a horror movie in the auditorium and the principal wanted as much students that could stay. I was excited, I've never stayed after school before, it was going to be a day to remember. Soon enough, I feel my phone vibrate. My mother was spamming my phone with text messages! I ran out of the auditorium and called my mom, she was between furious and worried. She sounded like she wanted to cry but also wanting to yell at me and hit me. My mother picked me up from school and we drove around and she told me how if I wanted to stay after I had to let her know before hand. Overall, this is why I think that the principal should not make students stay after school because some parents won't let them.

My final reason on why I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because students will go home later than usual. When students stay after, it's usually for about two hours. In that case, that would mean if school ends at 2:50, then if you stayed after school you would go home around 4:50. An example is one day my friend named Generic_Name stayed after school for a yearbook program. Later on, the program took longer than she expected, she got home around five. Her father screamed at her for coming home so late. It was late for him because the sun was already going down. I felt so bad, she came to school the next day saying she couldn't stay after anymore for the yearbook program or anything dealing with staying after. Another example is I was staying after school for a track meet and I was the manager because the principal wanted me to be the manager. The meet ended at 7:30, I honestly didn't think the meet was going to end at 7:30. My sister came to pick me up and she said if my parents were home they were going to be so mad. I should've sent a text to my sisters or my parents telling them I was going to go home late. Overall, this is why I believe that students shouldn't have to participate in after school activities.

Because of students having to do other things at home, parents not allowing them to stay after school, and students getting home later than usual, I believe it should not be a must to do an after school activity, even if the principal wanted to. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

C6EF9DDBAA4C,"Put yourself in a position were you are a student at school and you principle recently announced that every student is going to have to take an extracurricular activity like sports, working on the yearbook, serve at the student council, etc. How would you respond to this and what would you do to defend or argue against it. I argue against it and say that all students should not take an extracurricular activity because they maybe have interest into it, be clueless of what do to in the activity, or maybe have more important things to do instead of that activity. In my paper hopefully I convince you to argue against why students must participate in extracurricular activities.

First thing I say a student in some case may have no interest into the activity because he has experienced it before and didn't like it or had a bad experience. For example if the school has only three sport activities like baseball, soccer, and football the student just wants to do a sport. The student doesn't want to do football at all because he couldn't throw as far as all the other kids and got bullied for it having a really bad time. And since there is a little amount of sport activities he will be a lucky guy if he got baseball or soccer. The next day he finds out everything has been filled for soccer and baseball and he doesn't want to do anything else either than a sport so he just has to choose football. What would you do if someone bulllied you for not doing something properly and be afraid to do it again.

Second thing is maybe the student has no clue in what to do the activity he chose but has to try to do it because his parents think he should try something new in something he or she doesn't like but just wants them to feel happy. If the student joins a science club but enjoys doing coding on computers he or she has to try to do it because he wants to make his or her parents happy. Also the student parents do a check up on him everyday to see what he or she has learned in the science club but doesn't know that much in science so the student can't say much about it. Eventually the student gets tired of it and tells his or her parents he or she doesn't like it but its to late for the student now, every other club is full and can't take anymore now he just has to deal with it. If you were in this situation were you didn't like something and you wated to change it what would you do?

Third thing is if a student has more important things to do like study for a test, finish a big project, or finish late homework but at the same time he wants to practice soccer because he wants to become a soccer player when he or she grows up what can he do to balance things out between school and sports. If there were more activities throughout the school that had both in this case like one week about working on school and another on just sports that would be his or her top choice. So he is going to have to make a difficult choice and both of them can lead him or her to bad things if he doesn't do one or the other. How would you handle this situation of balancing important things out.

In conclusion I argue against it and say that all students should not take an extracurricular activity because they maybe have interest into it, be clueless of what do to in the activity, or maybe have more important things to do instead of that activity. All I'm saying if you want to make students take extracurricular activity mandatory have more clubs than you can think of so each student can be satisfied or rearrange students after the process of them selecting clubs. Think about hard desicions will be and how will you solve problems that appear out of nowhere.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Getting involved in after school activities is a great way for students to learn what they love and to excel at it. In addition the right balance of after school activities and school can reduce stress and improve time management skills. It is important for students to be involved in an extra curricular activity after school because it helps them make friend, develop new skills, and can accompany the lessons taught at school.

Participating in extra curricular activities after school can help build relationships and create friendships. By getting involved in different activities after school student have the chance to meet new people who attend different schools or get to know the people they already know better. When participating in an after school activity that a student enjoys there will already be a group of of other students a similar age, and that have common interests making it easy to start conversations and build relationships. For instants the students of the track team will always be able to discuss track practices, meets, and how much fun it is. In addition they always see each other at practices allowing them to get to know each other better. When students get involved in an activity they enjoy he or she will spend quality time participating in the extra curricular that they and a friend both enjoy instead of hanging out on there phones, which in this day and age is quite common. After students locate the activity they enjoy, they can participate in that activity through their adulthood always giving them an outlet to make new friends.

Being involved in an activity outside of schools can assist you in developing new skills. As students try different things they will be given an opportunity to learn about the many different kinds if activities that are offered. By participating in extra curricular activities it allows students to discover what they excel at and what they enjoy allowing them to be able to pursue it. Even if student don't enjoy physical activities such as sports, they can still excel at other clubs such as knitting, sewing, yearbook, or even video games. By simply practicing the things they enjoy students will be able to develop a talent for the activities they enjoy. Participating in after school activities allow students to develop a habit of learning new skills that can aid them in schools, and their future careers.

Getting involved in after school activities is important because it is a great way to accompany the skills taught at school. Most students come home and do nothing but homework until dinner do to not making the most of the time given at school such as study periods. By participating in extra activities outside of school the student will learn how to effectively manage their time consequently making more time for the activities they enjoy. Studies have proven that getting a hour of exercise daily is good for the health, and can help lower stress levels. Even if they choose to participate in a non-athletic activity the student can still reduce stress by spending time participating in an activity they enjoy. Time and stress management are both important life skills that can be assisted by joining after school activities.

It is important for students to be involved in an extra curricular activity after school because it helps them make friends, develop new skills, and can accompany the life lessons taught at school. Extra curricular activities aid students in building long lasting friendships. Participating in after school activities assist students in developing new talents and encourage them to trying new things. Getting involved in after school activities can teach students stress reduction and time management. Participating in after school activities can benefit students many ways and allows them to try new things.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
F83702EEB830,"I agree with it because everyone has to do something productive in school and playing a sport is good for our health, yearbook writing is good for our spelling, and serving in a student council makes you be more confident and talk more with other people.

Playing a sport is the best way to make our bodies stronger and healthy, it also helps us mentally when you are going through times going outside and playing helps you a lot. Playing a sport in school helps you have more energy and be ready to learn it likes opens your mind. Soccer for example is helps your body be stronger, Volleyball helps your hands be more stronger, Basketball helps you jump higher, and Football helps you run faster.

Writing or coloring the yearbook is a great idea too, because you are writing something that everyone is going to see so i know you gonna write neat and correctly. Coloring is good for our brains too it helps us be calm and out of stress. Spelling is one of the most important things and writing helps it improved it, coloring is something that not everyone knows how to do it, but by practicing we are gonna learn.

Serving in a student council helps you a lot because you learn something very important and thats learning how to communicate with other people and be nice. Sometimes its hard to communicate or talk to other people but we have to do it because sometimes the people needs someone to talk to and someone to be there for them. Helping to helping is a best thing you can do maybe you are not getting something from it but at least your being a helper.

AA766FA05F63,"Do students have the time before and after school to participate in one or more mandatory extracurricular activities? The life of a student in nearly any grade can be very busy before and after the normal school day. If students are required to participate in these activities, there is a possibility of students becoming overwhelmed due to the added amount of effort put into extracurricular activities. The principal at our school has made the decision that all students participate in one or more extracurricular activities.

Students that already have activities before and/or after school will find it harder to participate in the activities listed by the principal. If conflicts were to occur in ones schedule, by perhaps reducing study time, discombobulating meal times, effecting sleep, conflicting with appointments, etc, the negative effects on a students general academics and personal life could be great. Foresay, a student may have a doctors appointment immediately after school, but also have to attend an important meeting with the student council at the same time. If this were to occur, how would the student respond to either missing the appointment, or missing the meeting? There would be consequences for both since the principal made participating in these extracurricular activities mandatory.

By participating in before and/or after school extracurricular activities, students may feel overwhelmed or stressed out with the workload and effort that must be put into these activities. Along with personal activities, and daily duties they must fulfill, and academic work at home, completing a quota for an extracurricular activity everyday or on a selected day will most likely result in the student feeling constantly overwhelmed. If our principal closes down the activities, or at least listens to the students say in this and changes the concept of these activities to a more efficient manner, then students will most likely switch to a positive outlook on supporting extracurricular activities.

If our principal does not allow students to have a choice in whether or not participating in extracurricular activities is mandatory or not, the results will not be positive for many students in and out of school. In a normal school day, students may have before and after school activities making their lives very busy. With mandatory extracurricular activities added to the already busy lives of students, students may feel overwhelmed and stressed out with the extra work at task. If the principal doesn't do something about this problem soon, many students will be angered and forced to battle with different emotions. Also, no one will likely find any positives with regards to extracurricular activities if everyone has a negative mindset caused by these activities.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
45AF6741757E,"Extracurricular activities are unnecessary, yet useful tools for success. All over the world, students participate in extracurricular activities; they do what that they enjoy or excel at. The ability to control what one does after school is refreshing to many students; they are overcome with the powerful feeling of independence. They can choose to play sports, take an art class, or argue in debate club. Students can also choose to go directly home and study. The decision to make extracurricular activities mandatory should not be enacted because it takes away freedom, does not account for all circumstances, and does not ensure interest in the activities.

In this day and age, freedom is a right many students do not feel they have. They are required to go to school for eight hours. After school, homework, studying or helping out around the house must be done. While those tasks are time consuming, the typical student should have enough time to participate in at least one extracurricular. However, the principle of controlling the time a student has after school is not right. Freedom is making a choice based on what one desires. It is not choosing to do something because it is mandatory. With this new rule, students will feel locked into something they did not consent to. The feeling of independence will inevitably dull. This rule would send the message that freedom, the concept the United States was founded upon, is not a priority in education.

Secondly, the life of an adolescent does not solely revolve around school; many go through struggles in their life outside of their educations. For example, some students have jobs that allow them to provide for their families. For a struggling family, the money earned might be used to put food on the table, or pay for electricity. Forcing a student to join an extracurricular would limit their time, thus limiting their income. This requirement could hurt a student more than it helps. That is the issue with the rule, it does not account for everyone and their situations. A student might be struggling in school and need the time after school to focus, as opposed to playing soccer. The circumstances of each individual student are sometimes unknown, and hard to categorize. Consequently, expecting everyone to gain from a restricting rule such as this one is unreasonable. Students have different commitments and circumstances they live with, forcing a student into an unwanted activity is unfair to them and their families.

Finally, requiring students to participate in an extracurricular does not ensure they will be interested in that activity. A student who does not care might chose art club, then pull the entire class down with a negative attitude. In another situation, the student might not actively engage in the club at all. Someone with no interest in a club would be wasting the time of the people around them and their own. Time is precious, for people only have a certain amount of it before they leave. There is no point in spending this treasure on something of little to no interest. There is the solution of finding another activity, but some students are not interested in the selection offered. Additionally, some students do not care enough to find a more enjoyable activity. Without this requirement, students would have the ability to take their interests and engagement and do what they please.

In conclusion, limited freedom, different situations, and low interest in activities are reasons why the requirement of after school activities should not be forced upon students. A mandatory extracurricular takes away the choices and independence given to students. Because all circumstances are different, it would not be right to require all students to spend their time on unnecessary activities. Lastly, interest cannot be born from nothing; an uninteresting activity to a student would be irritating to him or her and those around them. The ability to chose what one does with their time is an important skill for life; students must learn for themselves what interests them and how they personally benefit from their decisions.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Make them get more involved, and its good to participate in extracurricular activities.

It will make them want to do more work.

Also it will show how much you care about extracurricular activities then before.

Make them get more involved is a amazing way to go because it has more benefits.

Good options and it would change how you think.

Also its wonderful to see everybody getting involved.

Its good to participate in extracurricular actives because it can change their attitude for the better.

But the extracurricular activities can be fun. It has sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council,and many more to choose from.

But I strongly disagree with this statement because,People have other things outside of school. Some students outside of school might be busy because they have things to do so they can't do extracurricular stuff,students may not have the time to take extracurricular activities. Some students might not have the time to attend extracurricular classes, they might have other things to take care of. Students might not enjoy the things they do. Some students might not even want to go if theres nothing that interests them, so they would not take part of the activities.

At the end

I disagree with the concept of making students take extracurricular activities. Its terrible idea to the students and could take off time for the teachers as well, and how much time spent to the curriccluar activities. So forcefully making students take part of a extracurricular activity is bad and could be worse.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
5DE24AC546C3,"If your principal was to make a rule saying that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity how would you feel about that? I would feel like I was being forced to do something that I may not want to do. By making students participate in at lest one extracurricular activity could bring so much impact whether its good or bad and I think its mostly bad.

For example, a big problem is money, schools might not have enough money to support and make all these activity so they would have to cut school field trips, and other fun things that the students look forward to doing. Another problem is that parents might not have enough money to go out and buy the things needed for that activity let alone the things they need for themselves to eat, drink, and sleep under a roof at night, or maybe if the school says they will have it how would they get the money. Would we even have enough money to go on trips if we needed to, say we win matches, games and go to a competition to see who is the world winner we wouldn't have enough money for that so we wouldnt be able to go.

Therefore brings me into another problem time, we would have to plan to go to those competitions and matches, games for that activity, and the students might not even be able to go to the extracurricular activities because they already signed up for one after school they wouldnt be able to make both everyday unless they quit one, or try to switch schedules if they could but if they couldnt, the students would have to quit the one that there doing outside of school they dont get a choice to pick witch one to quit because the principal said the students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. If students are forced to participate in an extracurricular activity on top of the one their doing outside of school when would they have time to do homework, study for tests, hang out with friends and family they wouldnt be able to on weekend because they would be busy with that activity and on weekends they would rather have fun and hang out with friends than do homework I know I would.

Meanwhile, stress is a big and rising problem, students already stress enough with all the homework and tests that they have to do so by adding in work things onto their plate in going to lead to more stress and more failing grades do to stress and not being able to get work done in time. Stress is one problem a lot of people deal with and normally its mostly from school and by having a rule that all students most participate in at least one extracurricular activity your going to see a lot of students breakdown form stress.

Although having a rule that says that you must participate in at least one extracurricular activity could bring more people to be fir if its a sport or if its just like a debate club, chess club, or over all something like that it allows students to take a break from all the work they are doing, and instead of making it a thing you must be in you could say its optional and students would mostly likely be willing to join these activities.

Therefore, having this rule buy saying students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity should not be allowed because it overall isnt going to be useful or helpful buy creating more problems.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
9172095B8522,"Requiring a student to participate in an extracurricular activity takes away a students freedom to choose what a student does in their free time! I disagree with the principal, I think that students should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Certain students may not want or are able to participate in the activities. Students sometimes does not want to participate or are not able to participate. If a student wants to play a sport and does not make the team, that student may get stuck in an activity they hate, that also may waste the time of the student, who could be doing other activities at home to better themselves.

Forced participation of extracurricular activities may cause planing conflicts. Parents may have super tight plans for everyday, so adding picking up a child can cause serious problems for those families. That includes losing jobs because the parent can not complete the hours of their shift. Also those added steps to a day will have a even more serious effects on single parents.

What if the students make more friends? No, even if the student makes more friends some of those other students are not the best people to be around. Along with the fact that most of the cons of all this out weighs the pros. What if we give all the students rides back home? No, that would not work either. Bus drivers would have to work more hours making the school pay more for their salaries. Also most of the activities do not end at the same time so making the plans for the bus rides would take so much time and be hard to get together.

Requiring students to be part of extracurricular activities is wrong and should not be put into place at any school. Being part of an extracurricular activity is a choice to be made by students, not the schools. They are called extra for a reason.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
4449300739D3,"When was the last time you participated in a school activity? Participating in some extracurricular activities is actually a great way to represent your school. Things such as playing a sport for your school, working on the schools yearbook, writing a school newspaper, or serve on the student council are some great ways you can participate in school activities. Although, some activities can be a stress reliever for some students, others can also cause stress to some pupils that already have a lot on their plate. That being said i believe that it should not be obligated to participate in a extracurricular activity, but instead it should just be left as a choice.

As I mentioned before, sports are a great way to participate in extracurricular activities. Not only is it good for that, but participating in sports in general relieves a lot of stress, helps with exercise so it's good for your health, and a great way to practice partnership and communication. If you are on a team for your school, college coaches can come to your school and see how you and your team play. If they like how you play and want you on their team you can get a scholarship become a professional and make a career out of it, if you really love playing that sport. You never really know what the future holds, and a lot can come out of one choice and or decision you make. I believe participating in a school sport is the activity that most students would choose because a lot of pupils love sports and it is a fun activity to do with your friends and others.

Other activities that I mentioned were helping on the schools yearbook, writing a school newspaper, serve on the school council, and etc. Things like this can maybe give students extra credit though it would depend on what you are participating in. This might also look good in college interviews because it is showing them that you were interested in school activities and were well managed with the things you had to do in them. If you are a person who is well managed these activities would be great to join. They can also, help you improve on your photography, writing, and managing skills. Even though these activities are great, and good to show on college interviews it is still not a good reason to obligate this choice for students, because some can feel like they have way to much things to keep track of and adding an extracurricular activity on their hands is just too much for them to handle.

In conclusion, i believe yes that these activities should be free for all, but should not be an obligation. Instead of obligating it as a must it can be left as a choice and or option for students who would like and enjoy participating in the school activities. I disagree in the fact that making students participate in extracurricular activities should be a must. Some students have too much on their plate and just do not have the time to participate in these activities. Some scholars can also feel stressed out and or pressured by having to see or choose what activity they like that interests them so they can join. In my opinion i would not obligate this option, and would just leave it as a choice.                            ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
8AE9824CC802,"I dont agree with the principle. Some people don't like staying after school. Students might have plans after school so they couldn't come. Some people just don't like being forced to do something that they don't want to do. There might not be some classes that students don't like. If they wanted to do some extra curricular classes they would of done so already. The principle should not force students to do extra curricular activities because they have other plans, the school doesn't offer any classes that students like, and they just don't like school.

Some students have plans after school. If the principle forced them to do extra curricular activities they couldn't do it. Everyone cares about their social life. If they didn't go, their social life could be hurt. Nobody wants to miss hanging out with their friends. If they keep missing these their plans they could get a reputation for not showing up for things. Nobody wants to be late for something they care about. People should be able to do things outside of school. Besides if students don't show up for their classes, the school would just be wasting the teachers time. Everyone should be able to do the things they want without being in school.

The principle might not be able to offer all the classes the students want. There might not be things students want to do. If you didn't offer enough classes of different variety, students would become angry and upset that they couldn't offer the classes they wanted. Some people might not like the classes you offer to them. Some people are not into sports. They might not be good at art. There wouldn't be anything that students like. So then they would be forced into something that they don't really like or are not good at.

Some students just don't like school in general. If students don't really like school they wouldn't want to stay there longer than they have to. People don't like to stay at places they don't like for periods of time. If they did they would just hate it even more than they did before. Even trying to make fun things to do after school is over is still not going to make them like school even more. Especially if they are forcing you to do so. Some people would rather stay home and do something than stay at school longer. If the principle did this, people would just not like school that much. You can't always change people's opinion about stuff.

Finally, we can't force people to do something they don't want to do. If somebody did want to do an extra curricular activity they would of done do already. It would not be fair to force students to do something like this. People are going to be upset if the school doesn't have classes for everyone to enjoy.

1CA7B8FAA58E,"Whether it's being on a sports team or taking extra classes, I think it is a good idea for all students to do an extracurricular activity. I agree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities because students can interact with new people and it will improve home and school life.

The first reason students should participate in after-school activities is they can interact with new people. Students will have opportunities to make new friends during it. They can learn teamwork by interacting with other people, including coaches, teachers, and kids. Also, students can learn many other life skills by meeting new people. For example, they learn collaboration by working with others on a sports team or working on a group project. Interacting with new people is great for students and their futures.

Another reason to support extracurricular activities is it improves students home and school life. Students can earn better grades because others, their teachers or coaches for example, will encourage it. Some activities require good grades in order to do them. Less fortunate students could escape to their activities to forget problems they may have at home. Additionally, students can have trusted relationships with adults in their activities so if they have problems, they can talk to them about it. Students need to have good home and school lives now so they can focus on their future. An extracurricular activity can help them do that.

In conclusion, I agree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities. It helps students make new friends and learn teamwork. Also, you can learn different life skills from the activity. It improves home and school life by earning better grades and having places to go to when you need it. Another good thing about it is you have many adults you can trust and talk to about situations.

Extra school activities such as Flag Football and Game Room are great places to talk and play with friends. Students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity

One activity that is good for your health and is fun is sports. Sports can help you lose weight. While playing a sport your body burns calories and also burns off unneeded fats. Participating in sports can be lots of fun. While playing a sport you and your friends can talk and play and maybe even make new friends. Sports can help in future careers. Playing sports during a earlier time in life will add on experience and can help people in a career in that profession. Sports can be a great school activity for future careers, health, and just having fun.

Another club you can join is the Student Council. In this club you design and create the school dances. In the Student Council you create and design the dances so the other students will buy tickets and go to the dance. If you are in the Student Council you represent a portion of student views. While in the Student Council you and all of the other people there represent other students in some way which is why this club is so important. The Student Council makes decisions on events. The Student Council makes, organizes, and monitors all of the events going on and that are being planned. The Student Council is good for people who like designing, organizing, and helping other students.

Some students arent able to go after school. Some students have lots of homework and don't have any way to leave the school. Well Generic_School has late buses and have a homework club. With Generic_School's Generic_Name stay after you can also stay after school with a teacher then once you finished with the teacher you have the option to go to a club. Many clubs come with different benefits. Something like Game Room comes with the benefit of making new friends. Game Room also has the benefit of doing homework and learning new skills. Even if there are obstacles you can always make it to after school since Generic_School makes it so easy.

79DD950E0FE3,"Should all students be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity? There are many children who feel like they dont belong because they hang out with the wrong group or no group. School is very hard and can be tougher with nobody to talk to when you need it. There is proof that school is harder with no friends so I think they should be required to do an extracurricular activity.

Because school can be very difficult if you have no one to talk to or nobody to hangout with. It is a good idea for children to be required to do an activity. I dont think someone should have to do what the principal wants them to do. I think they should be allowed to choose what activity they want to do. This could also help with making friends and getting to know new people and talking instead of being antisocial.

There are many benefits to doing this in your school you can find the group you are supposed to be hanging out with. Im not saying drop your friends that you already have but add them to your friends and make them feel more included. There are other benefits to doing this with your school such as learning a new sport or learning something new about a topic or game. There is also a way to communicate and get to know your teachers more like if you are not into sports I think they should make teachers participate too. The teacher have to play a sport or help kids with homework.

There are disadvantages as well as advantages of doing this idea. You are being forced to do something not everyone wants or can do. You might not be good at sports and dont want join the yearbook committee. You might not have as much fun doing these things as other children do and they might be better then you at these things. These things can be hard and you might not want to do them but there will be a reward at the end for trying something new.

I think that this is a good idea to do for students to get to know each other and hangout and have exercise . This idea is very smart but I think that at the beginning of the year children should be allowed to vote on what they want to do. They should have someone draw out of a hat and choose twenty ideas for clubs and you get new clubs every nine weeks. This is a very good idea for kids who dont like talking to people and are having problems with there sport or something.

I disagree with this because theres a ton of stuff this would effect.

firstly it would be a giant hassle for anybody who has daily afterschool plans or has to do something because they would get in trouble for not going. Then it would be another giant hassle for people who do activities outside of school because then the school will think he's not doing them and then he'll get in trouble.

Another group of people it would be a giant hassle for is babysitters if you have to watch a little sibling after school or babysit for someone it would make it so you couldn't babysit. Another giant group of people it would effect is kids with afterschool jobs because they or their family might need that money but instead of working a job they have to work on the yearbook.

Then another group of people this would effect is student all of them, think about it what student wants to stay at school instead of relaxing at home. every students schedule would get changed by this and it would disrupt and change the community time schedule because now stores and fast food places that usually get alot of student customers when the school day is over will now get little to none. So i really do think that this little change that the principle is making can change the schedule of the town. Then another persons schedule that would change is Parents' schedule because if they have to pick their kid up at a later time then, that would mean groups of people coming at the same time which would cause a ton of traffic so then it all combined together will make it so stores have less Customers other than students and it will be harder to get around for the whole town.

So in conclusion let me know what you think whether we should be forced to do school activities after school or if we can do our jobs. If you agree with me stand up to your principle if they do force you to do afterschool activities then write a persuasive essay like i did. and you dont know but it might just change his mind about it.

FBF8E0C998BF,"Every student's dream is to be successful, happy, and healthy in life. One thing that can help people achieve this goal is by taking a part in an extracurricular activity. Whether it be sports, debating, getting work done, or just hanging out, students can gain experiences that can guide them in the path of life. Just by partaking in one after school session, new life lessons can be learned, and things like social skills, core virtues, and new work ethics can be absorbed and applied to daily lives. With that being said, extracurricular activities can be beneficial to students in many ways, including introducing new hobbies, helping to build friendships, and pushing students out of their comfort zones.

Hobbies start out as small things that people do for fun. As time passes, that hobby can become a part of people's daily lives. They constantly use what is learned from those experiences and apply it to other things. It is very useful in so many ways, but some people either choose not to show their talents, or don't know where to start. By committing to an extracurricular activity, people can explore many different genres of platforms that they can express their skills on. By being able to express their talents, their stress levels can make a steady decrease, and they can focus on the things that make them happy.

Some people can make new friends very easily, but unfortunately, some people are not blessed with that talent. Through extracurricular activities, anyone can find people who have similar interests as they do, where as that can be hard to find in a big places, like new schools or churches. By joining clubs and other programs, people can have fun with other people that they normally would not think to be friends with. For example, a couple of kids that enjoy playing soccer in their free time want to join a soccer club. They attend an interest meeting after school and meet lots of other boys that share the same interest in soccer as they do. When they go to the first practice session, they see all their new friends and have lots of fun with them. In addition to making new friends and hanging out with them during the after school session, the new friends can greet each other in the hall and introduce them to friends that don't go to the soccer club. There are many other instances where something like this could happen, so joining an extracurricular program is very much recommended.

Although it may seem scary, pushing students out of their comfort zones is a very effective work ethic used by parents and teachers that want their children to succeed. By doing this, teens are more likely to acquire good results, no matter what it is that they are trying to succeed in. If a child is pushed to commit to an extracurricular activity, they will not only see how fun it can be, but they can also see how it can help them get further in life. Extracurricular activities are designed to not only help students find what they are interested in, but they help students that are having a hard time. They are suited for people that aren't able to go to other places to join clubs and people that have schedules that are not suited for other places. Extracurricular activities can ensure a safe, fun place that provides a place for students to express their creativity.

In some ways, extracurricular activities can be intimidating to people that are scared to go out and meet new people. Nevertheless, extracurricular activities can help people explore new passions, make new friends, and be pushed to always try their best whenever and wherever. If people have a hard time finding out what after school activities they should participate in, they should always go to their counselor for help or talk to another trusted adult. At the end of the day, extracurricular activities are a fun alternative to going other places that will always there to benefit you and guide you to a sure success.         ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

The principal of your school has decided to make extracurricular activities mandatory. Extracurricular activities should not be mandatory because, students need, family time, rest time, and play time.

Students need to have time with their families. If students do not get family time, then they could become mentally sick and incapable of certain tasks and activities. There are also many benefits of family time. Some of those benefits are: better relationships with others in the family, improved behavior, and all-in-all improved mental health.

The average child needs 8-9 hours of sleep each night. Many children already do not achieve this amount of sleep because of school. If the Principal makes extracurricular activities mandatory, then most students will have to sacrifice play time and possibly even family time. The performance of students on tests and other class work will start to go down. It will affect the school as a whole if the students are over-tired and slow.

Normally, students are able to hang out with friends, play video games, watch TV, and other activities that the students enjoy. Studies have shown that a little bit of play time or video games each day helps kids to focus. The students could then use that focus to do better in school. If students are being forced to participate in extracurricular activities, they will most likely just lose focus and do worse in school.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities should not be mandatory, students need, family time, rest time, and play time.

F57E2EF9F638,"Extracurricular is a right, a choice in what us students get to do or don't. Not a mandatory rule the school forces upon us. I believe that every student should not be forced to do a extracurricular activity.

I think students should get to choose if they do work sports or put effort into clubs. They shouldn't be forced around by rules to do things. I disagree on mandatory extracurricular activities.

Extracurricular actives are extra time added to the already long school day. Students work for a total of 6 hours and 40 minutes a day and the addition of the homework and projects with averages up to about 8 to 9 hours and day, we focus on school work. We don't need more time added to our already long and stressful day. Some students have a lot of other things going on in their personal lives outside of school. So forcing student to stay after to do dance, sports, clubs, art is a waste of time, materials, and money. Paying for the equipment to do sports, paying the teachers and janitors for staying after school hours, materials needed for the clubs. Making kids do extracurricular activities creates a ripple effect, affecting the the whole school, it being money or on people.

Another reason is that the school doesn't provide to the students in what they are interested in. So being forced into an club or group that you are not fond of, it will only discourage them and unmotivated the student not to try there best. If a student doesn't find the actives interesting and entertaining they wont care and they should get to decided if they get to put work and effort into a curtain activity. But having 1000 plus kids in about a few activities will make the some of the activities more crowed and more packed. And the teacher to kids ratio won't work out, 1 teacher with 50 kids. That sounds like a not of work for the teacher. But imagine the buses and the parents in the cars that came to pick the kids up. The bus is gonna be stuffed with kids and the kiss and ride line is gonna be extremely long. And picture the traffic in front of Generic_School, all of the cars and all of the buses trying to get to their locations.

In the end I believe extracurricular actives shouldn't be forced but more encourage. Schools should know that students are busy, that students are not interested in the same things, and to be aware of the ripple effect caused by making extracurricular activities mandatory.

But more importantly the student should be the ones who get a say in what they would like to do or not to do after school and be the ones who choose to stay for the actives. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

For example, if you are alone or you want to know new people in the activity you can find new friends or you just go and sign in with a friend.

18FCCD9CAC40,"I agree with the principal, kids need these extracurricular classes. Because after a long days of work, kids want to have fun and relax. First of all kids are full of energy, and parents want them to get it all out before they come home.

Secondly kids can have these extracurricular classes to get rid of their jitters, and have fun at the same time. lastly some kids are less hyper so we can have extracurricular like reading, coloring, photo journalism, etc. In conclusion kids will need these things to calm their nerve or to just chill and do whatever they want .

Sometimes kids are given ice cream or sugary drinks and food at school and the kids will get hyper. They need these things to help them work out the sugar in their bodies. Like sports can help by making them run around and making them tired and get rid of the jitters. in conclusion going to do the extracurricular activities or something can get rid of their jitters out of their systems .

Some kids parents want them to get their jitters out before coming home, but the kids just sometimes want to wait to play with their parents. So kids can go run around and play with friends play games and stuff at school in the extracurricular activities. If kids do these than when they go home they can go to sleep and not bother their parents. in conclusion kids are crazy when they get home so if they get it out at school than they get rid out their energy they wont annoy their parents .

Kids that are calm and quiet are not really active and don't want to do sports. So they can join extracurricular that are calm also like coloring . They can also do reading,yearbooks,and photo journalism or something they like. In conclusion some kids want to do sports and some don't in the extracurricular classes they can do whatever they like .

Kids will need to let out their energy or else they will be bouncing off the walls with so much energy. Some kids would like to let that energy out so they go to the extracrrecular classes. Some kids ant to just chill so they go to these classes where they can do both. In condition I agree with the princapal they should put extracurricular classes for those hyper and non hyper kids .",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
317C1C9BCDA0,"Most people you know probably participate in some form of an extracurricular activity. Whether it be sports, a school club, theatre, or something else, almost all of us have participated in an extracurricular at some point in our lives. Extracurricular activities have many benefits, such as an opportunity to do something you enjoy, which will make you happier and help you relieve stress, and an opportunity to meet new people who share your interests. However, some people may argue that extracurricular activities take away time that they don't have, but there's a solution for that. I agree with the principle's decision to have everyone participate in an extracurricular activity because there are many benefits that come from participating in them.

Extracurricular activities are a great way to do something you enjoy. There are many different things to do which means that there is something for everyone. Having the opportunity to be participating in something you enjoy will make you happier. It has been proven that when you're happier, you have lower stress levels. When asked, 9 out of 10 students said that they felt stressed by school often. An extracurricular activity is a great way to relieve some of that stress. By participating in something you enjoy and something you chose to do, you'll be able to improve your skills, which can give you a sense of accomplishment and happiness. These are just some of the benefits of an extracurricular activity.

Extracurricular activities are also a great way to meet new people. There are people that come from all different backgrounds, that you may not have classes with at school, that may be in different grades, or that you may have never known without participating in an extracurricular activity. These new people will share the same interests as you which is a great way to be able to do things together and it gives you an opportunity to be able to learn from each other. By being in an extracurricular activity where you get to meet these new people, you'll have an opportunity to hang out with them on a regular basis when you may not have been able to do that any other time. These are just some of the other many benefits that an extracurricular activity can bring.

There are some people who may argue against everyone having to participate in an extracurricular activity. They may say that they don't have the time to participate and if they do then they won't get their school work done. However, other people who participate in extracurricular activities get their work done on time which means that there are ways to do so. You also won't have that activity every single day which means that it won't inflict on your everyday life. If you're worried about not having time to get work done, you can focus really hard during your study hall period to get more work done, you can get up earlier in the mornings to get extra work done, and you can even do work on your way to or from the activity, or to and from school in the mornings and afternoons. You may also argue that there are no extracurricular activities that are offered that you want to participate in. However, there is such a wide variety of things to do at most schools that there is something everyone can enjoy. However if there isn't something you would want to participate in, most schools will help you create a new club that you can recruit people for and run with a teachers help. Even if people want to argue against this new rule, there are solutions to their complaints.

Overall, there are many benefits to participating in extracurricular activities. You get to do something you enjoy, you get to meet new people, you'll be happier, and although people may find ways to argue against the new requirements, the good outweighs the bad. There are plenty of options at most schools so that everyone can find something that they enjoy. There are plenty of different sports, there are debate clubs, the student council, yearbook committee, the school newspaper, theatre, and clubs for almost any interest someone may have. In conclusion, I agree fully with the principal's new decision and I believe that everyone should participate in some type of extracurricular as well.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
949D00C575AE,"Just imagine, one day you're in the most boring class ever just waiting for the bell to ring so you can finally go home but it feels like forever. Just looking at the clock, next to the teachers desk every second just hoping for the time class dismisses you but you're going in slow motion. But the principal announces that every student in the school has to participate in a extracurricular activity and it puts a smile on your face because you now have something to look up too and school wont be boring anymore.

If your principal were to announce on the announcements that every student has to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, would you agree that students should or not? I would say yes and i have two reasons why.

My first reason why this is a good idea is that students would be more active around the school. Take working on the school yearbook for example. by teacher permission students should walk around campus for quotes from the students, and students can draw the yearbook cover that supports the theme of the year and towards the end students can vote on the top five cover ideas. or they can sign up for clubs for fun, for example: chess club, Art club, Band club, Dance lessons, and school plays. or they can sign up for student council and participate in the parts of a school principal and monitor the school.

Second supporting reason is students can also participate in after school sports. If kids were to participate in sports activities they would have better health and be more physically fit and also make new friends and just all in all have fun. Students can also tryout for the school teams and begin an athletic career for themselves, and if they were to work hard enough and enjoy the sport their playing, it could possibly lead to a professional career. Another reason for this claim if for students to enjoy themselves after a stressful day of work, tests, and final exams, then after school students can spend an hour or two destressing by playing sports and have fun with friends. And at the end of the day students would be exhausted and would rest well for the next day.

My counter claim for why this idea is not good is because, student grades can fall from the lack of focus from these activities. I say this because students usually lose track on what they're supposed to do than what they want to do. Another reason for this counter claim is, students would not only lose focus on their school work but they'd also most likley not follow directions around school in hallways or in class.

All in all I support this idea and these are my reasons whhy I support it, and not only that this helps kids be more active and fit, this also helps boosting social skills and making new friends and possibly change how the school functions around students.                                  ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
F7DE0C3BDC04,"The school has decided that everyone must participate in an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities can be almost anything. It is a wide range of activities, from being on a sports team to drawing objects in the classroom. Therefore, I think students should participate in an extracurricular activity.

Firstly, students who don't know what they enjoy now may find something they will enjoy in the future. Being a teenager is when you find out what you are defined by. Are you a sports person? Do you like geography? Do you like computers? An extracurricular activity, like a computer club, would be where one decides if they like computers. This can help them decide what to do with their future, as the person found out if they want to continue with computer science, or if they think computer science is not their thing.

Second, this can help students decide what to do later in life. If one were in a geography club and enjoyed it, then they will likely be interested in the field of geography. They will likely study geography in college and get a job in that field. It can also decide what hobbies the students may enjoy as adults. They can find people who have the same hobby or interest, and meet some new people.

An extracurricular activity also looks better on a college application. Nowadays, colleges and universities look into what you do after school. Do you do extracurricular activities or do you just do school? They would be looking for what extracurricular activities you did in middle or high school. If you did some activity after school, you will have a slightly higher chance of making it into a university or college. They will think, ""Wow, Generic_Name did a lot of extracurricular activities. He was on the student council, in the geography and maps club, and into theater. That looks great!"", if you did activities after school.

In the end, students should be required to do an extracurricular activity. They can decide what they may enjoy in the future. This leads to what they may want to major in while in university, and what career path they want a job in. Universities also look at what you did after school. If you did something after school, it would look better on your application. This is why students should do an extracurricular activity. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
E7DA3EBD8366,"How would a person act if they were alone with nobody to socialize with ; sad, lonely depressed. Students should stay after for at least one student activity. I have been persuaded by teachers, parents and even friends that I should stay after school for a sport or a study session.

It helps students who aren't very social or extroverted to make new friendships and meet new people, as after school is a time to socialize. Some of these students don't have a very big social life at home. It could be for a multitude of different reasons. Such as strict parenting, introverted, different style and hobbies as other kids.

For a time that students could talk and be with one another is a stepping stone to meet lifelong friends. What if a students friends isn't in one of their classes, they could always stay after school for a hobby that they enjoy. That leads into my next segment.

Students could find hobbies that suit themselves and create a love for a project. the saying goes ""don't knock it till you try it"" which really comes to fruition with after school. Students could have a love for art and sports but never have the time to try it at home. or have a to busy life to get professional lessons for there craft such as piano. But with after school, students have four hours to do whatever the are interested or intrigued to do.

After school could bring subjects that are not yet integrated in school for better understanding for job opportunities, for students who are interested in the stock market and business, they can make something out of there hobby or craft. Students could have a hidden gift that they haven't tapped into, which could have a monumental help in the future.

What if students have problems at home and school is there safe haven? Studies show that students with problems at home usually love to stay at school because of there abusive parents, family members, not enough food. rough neighborhood; there are many upsetting reasons. Students also might have parents who work late and would rather not be home and would rather play with their friends after school.

Some students could learn great leadership and cooperating skills with clubs. clubs bring together people with the same interest and they can create and do a multitude of different thing such as a art club, esports clubs, fashion and streetwear club. Students could have clubs that help with academics like tutoring or poetry. Students could also have club presidents and many different things that they can do to keep their hobby fresh and exciting.

Students should stay after for at least one student activity. since there is a glorious school with loving teachers and amazing people, students should take advantage of after school. students should start clubs, play sports, regroup with teachers.

99F8774DE653,"I agree with the principal on this decision. Extracurricular activities allow us to learn new things which we can use later on in our lives. Colleges and jobs like people who are determined to learn and try new things. These activities allow us to get a full grasp on life and truly live through it. We can use these activities to meet new people and make new friends. Extracurricular activities shape peoples lives, which is why I will be explaining why everybody should try at least one activity.

Firstly, extracurricular activities allow us to learn new things which we can use later on in our lives. These activities spark new hobbies and interests which shed some joy on life. Their are a variety of activities around the world which lead to a vast amount of things people can learn including, a language, a new sport, or a musical instrument. These activities allow us to do things other than sitting at home watching television. We need to put a good change in our lives otherwise their is no point in living it.

Secondly, colleges and jobs like people who are determined to learn and try new things. Extracurricular activities show we can handle multiple things at once, which allows employers to know you can handle the work they give you. Also, after learning something from an extracurricular activity you can use it to help your associates at work which could lead you to getting promoted. Colleges like people who enjoy trying new things, it shows you are willing to do the things the college has to offer, which looks good for the school. Colleges also like people who use the knowledge that the school gives to them instead of wasting it on nothing at home.

Lastly, we can use these activities to meet new people and make new friends. If you do go to extracurricular activities their is a good chance you will meet new people who like the same activity that you do and it's someone that you can talk to. Humans need companionship, and an easy way to find friends is through extracurricular activities which give us someone to laugh and have a conversation with. We don't want to be lonely all our lives, and an easy way to get around that is to make friends, friends help us when we fall ,and cheer us on when we get up, we help them and they help us and everybody feels great when doing so.

We need to realize all the good extracurricular activities have to offer by now. They help us learn new things, meet new people, and get a better college education and a job. These activities shape our lives and give us something to enjoy and look forward to daily. We need to appreciate all the opportunities we have to learn new things that other people don't. We can't waste this precious life away by doing nothing fun or exciting, to fully get a grasp on life we need to reach out and grab it. Our principal isn't torturing us by making us do an activity, he's trying to help us in this short but amazing life of ours.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
A8BAAEDA8475,"Only about 40% of students participate in after school activities. Schools tend to offer a wide variety of activities such as drama, lacrosse, debate, band, and so much more. Despite all of the activities, some student's don't feel the need to join any clubs or teams. Therefore, making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity wouldn't be a good idea because students may not have enough time, not enjoy any of the activities, or feel mad.

Even though students are young, they can be pretty busy. Many students participate in activities outside of school, which can cause their schedule to be pretty tight, and that's not even counting homework. Some may barely have enough time to transition between school and any other activity they may have. So if someone made it mandatory for students to join a club or team, they would have to drop another activity, which they might feel really passionate about.

Schools tend to offer many activities, but they don't offer all of them. As a result, there will be students who just aren't interested in any of them. Many may feel it's best not to waste their time on something they won't enjoy. So making students participate in an activity may cause them to not feel motivated in whatever they're doing, which can bring the whole team or group down. If a student is forced into an activity they don't enjoy, they wont want to do much with the group/team.

If schools force students to join a team or club, they might feel like their free will has been stripped away from them. Many students today can get upset really quickly. Students may want to rebel and skip the meetings/practices. They may even get angry and try to shut the whole idea down, or rant on social media. Forcing students to do extracurricular activities can cause them to get even more homework, which can really effect their mental health, depending on the situation.

Overall, forcing students to do extracurricular actives is a bad idea because they wont have enough time, may not want to do any of the activities, or even get angry. Schools should stay the way they are, and only offer the activities and not force them. Even if it may seem like a good idea to make extracurriculars mandatory at first, it wont take long for it to backfire. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
515CFDAAA723,"Did you know that it is now mandatory to join an extracurricular? We already have so much to do in the little time we have after school, now we have to spend more time on a extracurricular. Students should not be forced to join an extracurricular because most students are to busy and dont have the time, others may not like the extracurriculars offered at the school,or may not be able to join because they dont want to stay in the school environment for longer than they have to.

Lots of students will not have the time to join an extracurricular and may have to quit other activities. Older students may have jobs to go to and then spend the rest of their time studying for school. Studying for school alone already takes up so much time for a successful students day. If they have to join an extracurricular than they will be under too much stress since the lack of free time and will have an even tighter schedule. A study at Harvard shown that 76% of students are under so much stress and 34% will develop negative effects such as depression, anxiety, or tiredness and it will effect their grade. Other students that have more time on their hands, most likely already are in clubs outside of school that involve the community, such as Girl/Boy Scouts, religious groups, environment groups, or private sports teams. If students will forced into extracurricular groups there is a chance that they will have to quit one of their activities to make time for the extracurricular activity.

If the students will forced into extracurricular groups there will be students that dont find any activity fun or amusing. The students were a part of outside school groups but had to quit because of time management, will probably not find interest in groups the school has to offer because they were not like other groups. Some students will probably find these groups a waste of time. Students at other schools will be able to join more outside school clubs specifically for them, while students here will be forced to join some club they will not find interesting and probably useless. Yes, there will be students that do not mind this new rule, but others will not get the same fun experience, instead they may end up disliking the principle and school.

Some students may not want to join an extracurricular because they dont want to be in the school environment than longer than they have to. More introverted students would not want to join an extracurricular because they are tried and want to go back home were they can spend their time freely and independently. It would be good to have lots of student participation and school spirit, however it should be at will and not something mandatory of students to do if they dont feel comfortable. Eventually students will find it very irritating that they have to be in extracurricular and will try to find an excuse or way to quit. Forcing students to join an extracurricular will not give out a positive effect on the school and its reputation. Its better to have student that feel passionate about an extracurricular than students that dont want to be there and just want the school day to end.

Students should not be forced to join extracurricular because they will not get a positive school experience from it. Joining an extracurricular will get more school spirit and students may learn new thing, however it should not be mandatory and nobody will get anything positive from force. We must tell our principle that this new rule is outrageous and should be changed, instead have more school assemblies or let students speak their mind at school more. If the school just pushes ans pushes this new pressure on us it will end with students feeling more stressed, more irritated at the school, and feel like they are more trapped. I do not agree with this decision and as a student I can tell that this will not have a positive effect on me or my peers.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
086603D5B319,"It's 9pm, you haven't finished your homework. You would've finished your homework, if you had the choice to go straight home. However, the extra curricular you have to participate in, took too much time. That's the view of a student, if they would have to participate in a extracurricular activity. Students would have no time to play their Xbox, and have no time to finish that 8 paragraph essay, if they had to participate in a extracurricular activitiy. I don't agree that students should be forced to take one extracurricular activity, because it makes students do something they don't like, makes students have no time for homework, and does not allow students to go home and have time to breath.

Extracurricular activities, are for people who want to be in that activity, or feel interested in it. If student's aren't interested in that activity, then why should they be forced to do it? How would you feel if you had to be on the basketball team but you don't even like basketball?

Extracurricular activities would also make students stay up at 10pm to finish their homework. They would make students more overwhelmed with homework, because the extracurricular activitiy would take too much of their time. Lastly, if students had to take a extracurricular activitie, students wouldn't get a break from school. Students want to get out of stressful school, and go home, but the extracurricular activitie abolishes that opportunity.

In conclusion, if the principal forced students to do extracurricular activities, it would make students more stressed out then they should be. If students don't like the activity they have to do, why do they have to take that activity? The poor students wouldn't have time to breath, and go home. Students relaxing time would be school time, so which one do you choose?

AA6CE053DB9A,"An extracurricular activity is something that only a few students take part in, but if every student had to join an activity, they would all have somewhere they want to be, and be doing something they enjoy, instead of going home right away and not having the fun a young person should be having. Extracurricular activities are a way for students to enjoy learning, learn in a non-stressful environment, and have fun while doing it. I agree with the decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because it gives students an opportunity to learn new things and meet others who might have the same interests, have something fun to do after the school day, and become part of a group.

Making extracurricular activities mandatory can give students opportunities to learn new skills, and meet others who could share the same interests. Students who join an extracurricular activity they enjoy, would have an opportunity to explore new ways to do things and learn from the other members of that club, committee, or group. If students had to join extracurricular activities, they would be able to make friends and spend time with them each meeting, therefore getting to know them well, feel comfortable talking to them and becoming very good friends. In addition, joining an extracurricular activity is a great way for students to learn the necessary skills that are needed for that specific activity, in case they would want to pursue a career in that area. For example, if a student were to join the student council or debate team, they might have an interest in one day becoming a politician or a lawyer. In conclusion, extracurricular activities are a good way for students to make friends and learn new things that could lead up to a possible career.

Students who must participate in at least one extracurricular activity have something fun to do after the long school day. After school ends, many students must go home to do their homework and help out at home, but making them join an extracurricular activity can let them relax from a stressful day at school, and give them something fun to do that could help them forget the worries of schoolwork and upcoming assessments. From my own experiences, I have enjoyed having something to do and somewhere to go after-school instead of going home and doing homework. I used to play violin in the Generic_Name Youth Orchestra where I enjoyed going to every rehearsal and concert, because it gave me something else to think about, I got to be a part of an amazing ""family"", and have fun especially after a long day at home or school. In all, having something fun to do after-school, can ease the pressure from school away, allowing students to also enjoy life instead of being under constant stress and pressure from school, classmates, and family issues.

Mandatory extracurricular activities can make students feel ""at home"", in a particular group. Some students don't always feel like they fit in, and by making them join an extracurricular activity, they could find a place where they are free to open up, talk, and make friends. Having a place where students can be themselves, can give students a boost in self-confidence and morale, which can lead them to be more willing to participate at school and help out at home. Sometimes in life we are confronted by situations and people who can make you feel insignificant and lost, so if students who feel that way were to join an activity they enjoy, it could help them escape from that scary place even if it's just for a little while and help them smile. In conclusion, if all students participated in extracurricular activities, they could feel comfortable for at least some time, before they go back to their daily lives of schoolwork, homework, tests, and family business.

Making extracurricular activities mandatory for all students, is an excellent way for them to get to know each other, learn skills that they could use in the future, whether it's for a career or just for leisure, get to do something they enjoy doing after a long day at school, and give students a chance to express themselves without fear of being left out and ignored. By making every student participate in an extracurricular activity, we can ensure that every student has a place where they will feel protected and have their ideas heard.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
63901FEE7589,"I agree with the principal that every student should participate in an extracuricular activity becuase, students should have more oppurtunities to broaden their minds and be open to new experiences. Especially, experiences that are beyond what basic school curriculum touches on. Students are also able to meet others that share common interests through extracurricular activities.

Foremost, extrcurricular activites are usually very positive environments where students can enjoy themselves without the pressure of school and other issues. For students that may have family problems, these activities may be their escape where they can indulge into what they enjoy doing. If students spend their time in a healthy, fun environment, they're much more likely to be overall happier people and probably perfom better in school.

Another reason why extracurricular activites should be an essential for students is that usually, whether the activty is a sport or some type of club, the school curriculum probably won't cover that topic as much because it has it's own standards it needs to follow. So, in turn, students should participate in activities that interest them because these activities will encourage them to think more deeply, widen their minds, and create new experiences for themselves that they would not get a chance to experience if they never did anything outside of school.

Many students that may be more on the introverted side could also thrive in extracuricular activities since they will have the chance to meet other students that share common interests as them or else, they wouldn't have chosen the same activity. When students already enjoy what they're doing with their free time it's only more beneficial if they have the chance to express their feelings about it with other people that unerstand what they're talking about since they also participate in that activity.

Lastly, very many children in our generation are going to be familiar to a world constantly on their electronics. Although you can't change the modernization of civilization, students should take this time while they're still young and have more time for themselves to join extracurricular activites for the sole purpose of learning more of what interests them. Taking what they have learned in these activites will definetly help them in some way shape or form in the future.

In conclusion, I do believe that extracuricular activities should be part of students' day to day life because the experiences they're getting, they probably will not recieve anywhere else. Activites are a wonderful way for students to spend their time and possibly help them in real life situations when they grow up. Through the helpful and friendly environment, students will work to achieve the fullest potential in their activities.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
6FC90DA103BA,"Have you ever felt like you don't know anyone or don' t really have a hobby? Extracurricular activities can change that. Many people have found their passion and have continued on and have become very successful because of a club or activity they were in as a student. I believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the opportunity to make new friends, discover new interests and cure their after school boredom.

Firstly, getting students involved in an extracurricular activity will help them to make new friends and meet new people. This can help students make friends with a similar interests. For example, one of the most beloved country music duos of all time, Brooks and Dunn, met through extracurricular activities. In 6th grade, the two joined a club called FFA and fell in love with it. Their FFA chapter had a bus for the members when they went on trips. The old, rusty bus had no radio. A couple close friends of the boys had saw them sing in church before and suggested they sing on the trips because of the broken radio in the bus. The boys agreed and sang all sorts of country songs for the members as they traveled. The boys had such a passion for singing what was on the radio that they figured they would produce songs for the radio. Now, they are both millionaires and travel to sing all across the world.

In addition to making new friends, extracurricular activities sprout interest in other hobbies. In 1988, a mother signed her child up for music club because she was working late and didn' t want her daughter at home by herself. Little did she know, her daughter would be one of the most famous singers in history. Her daughter was the worldwide phenomenon, Taylor Swift. Taylor was a shy kid. Though she had a passion for music, she was to scared to sing in front of people. While being in music club, Taylor gained enough confidence to sing in church. While singing in church, a record label producer was there and signed her to his label. She is now producing music and make millions of dollars.

Lastly, extracurricular activities give students something to do when they get home, after school. Some students come home and immediately turn on the TV or play video games, instead of exercising or doing their homework. If it wasn't for a policy at J.K Rowling' s school would would not have the many great books we have today. Her freshman year of high school she entered book club. She gained a love and passion for science fiction books and decided to start writing them. Many of her books have been turned into movies and she is now one of the most successful authors of all time.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities are very beneficial to our students in many ways. They can help our students be successful in our future careers.

I believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the wonderful opportunities like making new friends, discovering new interests and giving kids something to do after school. These can help students in many ways and help us develop a successful future generation. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
7417FAAAD521,"I disagree with this decision because some people might not want to participate in these extracurricular activities. Some people rather go home and do other things because they might not enjoy any of these activities and they rather do other things. Also I think that these activities will get you exhausted because you also got other stuff to worry about outside of school. Then you got the most important thing witch is school work. So in this SA i'm going to be giving you reasons why I disagree with this decision.

School work is a big deal, and a lot of people take it really serious so those people that take it really serious might think these activities will interfere with school work like studying all day or doing homework. Also some people got a certain schedule with school work like studying for a certain amount of time or doing homework for a certain amount of time, so I think these activities can interfere with peoples school schedule. Some people also hire tutors to help them after school so if those people with tutors had to do these activities they wouldnt be able to get the help they need and that can really affect them in school. Even for sports you got to practice to be good and if your to busy trying to practice you wont have that much time of school work.

So i think students should just focus on one thing which is school, and if your just focused on that one thing it would be better because you wouldnt have to worry about trying to practice and get school work done at the same time.

There are also people do are not into any of that kinda stuff, they rather just go home and do other stuff like play video games or go shopping. So if they had to do those activities they wouldnt have time to do what they want to do after school because of the activities. I also think that people should do what they want, like if they wanted to play video games after school or go shopping they should be able to do that instead of activities that they dont enjoy. Theres also no point of doing those activities either if you dont enjoy doing them, because then your just wasting your time when u could be doing stuff that u actually enjoy. Also people got stuff to do after school like chores, you wouldn't be able to do any of your chores because of the activities in the way. People also like hanging out with their friends after school and do stuff thats fun like play games outside or play video games together. Friends also like to hang out, and sometimes they cant hang out in school so they hang out when they get out of school. So I think these activities would interfere with peoples plans and friendships because if your doing these activities you really wouldnt have time to hang out with your friends.

I also think it is kinda bad for your health because some people get exhausted and stressed out because they got a lot going on like sports, responsibilities like chores, and school and its kinda gonna be hard for you to get all of that stuff done in one day. But if you do get it done then your most likely gonna be really exhausted, and with that type of schedule it might make you go to bed really late and thats not good for your health because you still got got to wake up for school early in the morning. Sometimes you might even have a big test the next day and you might end up failing it because you didnt have a lot of time to study because of your schedule. You also got sports to worry about, you have to practice on your own and practice with your team so you can get better. Sometimes you might even have to travel far for your games and that takes up a lot of your time. Even tho its schools activities i think the best time to do any type of activities is summer time because then nobody has to worry about school work or sports.

So I think the principal should find another time to do the activities, maybe the weekends or the summer because I dont think students should be forced to do these activities because some of them might not like the idea and not just that but people still got a lot of other stuff they got to worry about so I dont think thats the right time to do the activities. So those are all my reasons why I disagree with the principle.    ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
EBC1A7DD8878,"Picture this you walk into school one day to an announcement from your principal saying that extracurricular activities will be made mandatory. Your'e appalled, but I'm here to convince you its not so terrible and may actually be beneficial for you and your community. Extracurriculars can keep kids out of trouble, get them into better colleges, help the community, and allow them to meet new people and try new things.

Getting invested in an extracurricular activity is a great way to steer you away from a bad path. You may not have the time to do these things if all your time is being taken up by extracurriculars. It might also make you not want to do drugs or alcohol as they could affect your performance in one of these activities such as sports or a club that requires mental skills.

Extracurricular activities can greatly improve the chances of you getting in the college you want. Getting into a good college can effect your job therefor the entire rest of your life, so starting some extracurriculars can be very important not just for college but onward into your career.. It has often been shown that students with lower grades but high numbers of extracurriculars have higher acceptance rates than their counterparts with higher grades but lower amounts of extracurriculars. Colleges also like to see students who help their school communities. A great way of helping your school's community is through extracurricular activities as they do of cost you anything and are easy to enroll into.

Many extra curricular activities can help your school or local community. One example of a way to help your school's community is the yearbook committee as it helps out with creating the yearbook for that year in turn helping your school's community. The same could be said with your local community and an extracurricular that helps feed the homeless or donates to charities. Even though there are many ways to help your community extracurricular activities are a free way that requires little to no effort to become a member of one of them.

Extracurricular activities can help you meet new people and try new things. You can meet people who have similar interests to you. Meeting new people can benefit students social skills. When constantly put into a scenario in which you are using a skill that you're bad at just like anything else practice makes perfect and that applies for socializing as well. For instance if you do a baseball club you will find people who probably play baseball making it much easier to find new friends. You may also want to do something that interests you but you have never tried it before. Who knows it may become your new favorite hobby or a future career path you could opt to take.

While your principal may not actually be making extracurricular activities mandatory I would highly encourage everyone reading this to go out and take at least one. They could keep you out of trouble, get you into a good college, help your community, and help you meet new people. So go out and sign up for something and who knows maybe you'll love it. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
E9621B1CE4F0,"What would happen if your principal made a new rule where you have to go to an after school activity let me tell you what I think. On a personal scale I don't go to many after school activities. Once school is over I like to just get on the bus, go home and be done with school for the rest of the day. If the principle made a new rule where everybody had to do an after school activity I would strongly disagree. The reasons for this would be that some kids such as myself are tired of school and don't want to hang around. Another reason may be that they may have a sibling in a nearby elementary school that gets home later than them, but no parents are home so they have to be. The last reason is nothing may really stick out to some people.

Someday you just have had a long extra boring day and want to be done with it. If you do, I would agree that most after school activities are fun ways to waste time and keep you at school. I don't think that they should be enforced to go to them because people aren't always in the mood and just want to get home to relax, do there homework, and watch the Simpsons or play video games. Kids should'nt be force to do thing they don't like, even though that's exactly what school is. Kids need time to relax and do something on there own time and after school activities are not that.

If you have a younger sibling and both your parents work then you know what it's like. Having to go home right after school to make sure that they get there safe and then watching them till your parents get home. I feel that lots of kids have this problem or situation I should say. These are the type of people who don't have the time needed to g to any sort or type of after school activities. My question for the principal would be what would he do with these kids make them come and do them over the weekend have the parents hire a expensive babysitter. I'll tell you what he'll do absolutely nothing. He can't barge his way into a family plan like that just because he wants kids to stay at school longer. Thats a stupid reason, to change a families whole system over something so small like that. If I was ever a kid in a situation like this I still would not go, Because their family system family is more important than a principals wish to waste kids's time.

The last reason I disagree with this is what if a kid who has all the time in the world has an older sibling or a guardian of some sort at home for a younger sibling. They look over all of the choices and stare just stare at them all because theres nothing there that fits there personality, then what do they do? I'll tell you what they'll do they don't go to any of the after school activities because thee nothing that they like what's the point it'll just seem like school but longer. I know what people would say ""oh, but they may just find a hidden talent they never knew they had"". No, Ive gone to a variety of after school activities and not ne new thing I've tried I stuck with, shocker. What percentage of kids actually find a ""hidden talent"" probably like 26%. The point I'm trying to make here is that even if nothing sticks out you can still go and try to find that "" hidden talent"" but to me that's just a bunch of baloney.

In the long run an in many people an after school activity is a chance to spread your wings and grow, but to me they suck I hate them. If your principal ever makes a rule like this where you have to go to any after school activity then start a petition get fifth teen pages worth of signatures show it to him. Tell him why you did what you did show him whos the real boss is by over throwing him, destroying the school and getting rid of that stupid new rule. I just really hate after school activities and all they don't have to offer.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
84D460E228D7,"I agree with the deision of the principal. I think that the students should do something that benefits them or the school. Things like playing a team sport can help in many ways. For example you get exposed to new people from your school you may have never talked to, and even kids from schools you dont even go to. And if the kid becomes very good at the sport they are playing then they can get recognized by colleges.

If the kid were to join the student council they get experience on being a leader for a group of people, they would have to make decisions for themselves and others, and get the experience they need to help them succeed in the real world. These are all important skils that I think each person sould have some experience with.

If the kid wanted to work on the yearbook they would learn about photography. This gives the kid a chance to go around the school and talk to some of the teachers, and students. They get to take pictures and dont have to sit in their classrooms for as long as their classmates. They get to see their friends, and learn about the art of photgraphy which can open doors for jobs in the future.

I think these activities arent just to make it so the student has something to do with tht hour or hour and a half of their day. I think these activities are extra chances given to us to help prepar for the future. And give us the skills needed to succeed, like working with others, and being a leader. These skills may not be offered agian in the future so I would suggest taking advantage of what you have been given. But these activities arent just done to help make your future a little brighter. Than done to help make the youth of the person playing these sports, oo on the council more enjoyable for them. To help them have fun and spend time with the people they enjoy. This can create memorys that peoplle want to keep because of the way they make a person feel. So choose wisely when picking the activities, make sure its oone that you know you will enjoy.  ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
994B1D43D406,"Students being required to join clubs at school is unfair and shouldn't be aloud. I think that having clubs for students to join and have the opportunity too is great and not at lot of kids around the world have that opportunity. But having students, especially teenagers required to join clubs could even make them resent school. It takes time out of every ones day, the students, teachers, and parents. Students being required to take clubs affects everyone.

Parents of these children will have to move around their work schedule to make the time to drive their kids to and from their clubs, and that isn't really fair. And what if the clubs cost money and students can't participate, what would happen then? Schools alone already have clubs to join but maybe some of the clubs don't appeal to students but they're forced to join one anyway, again thats not fair. Students also have a life outside of school, they may already do a sport, homework, work, or chores they need to do at home. Students have a life outside of school and shouldn't be forced to spare their own time.

There are a few reasons why it can be good though too. Schools could make money from the clubs and have more opportunities to help with their school. Some of the club's schools could help students in the future, then if students see themselves playing a sport in the future they can get a head start with the club. This could be a general idea for most clubs open to students. Joining a club could also help students be more social and meet people who have the same interests in them. If the school decides too, they could open clubs that could help them in the future for example, they could open a club that teaches students how to pay bills or taxes.

I think if students wanted to join a club they should, just as long as they want to and their not forced or required to. From my perspective as a student, if we were required to join a club it should be during school time not our own. Students have other things they also need to do in their life besides school. I think clubs are a great idea and do help you make friends and meet new people. If you choose the right club it could be an amazing thing for you. Clubs can be helpful for students sometimes, but again forcing them isn't the way to go.

Being required to take a club has its ups and downs. Having students participate in clubs could cause money and social problems. But it could give students opportunities and help them in the future. This should be a students choice, not the schools. If the school wants to make students take clubs on their own time, they need to check with parents too first. In conclusion, I think clubs are a great idea for students just as long as its their choice and they get to choose the club they want to be in.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
6C47182F230C,"""Success is not shown for just doing one thing, it's shown for doing multiple things."" -Taylor Swift once said. To further more illustrate, Students love playing sports or playing with the chess club at school. Students get to have fun out of school while still being on school grounds. For this reason, Students should be able to complete one extracurricular activity because it can lead to a new friendship, students have lots of fun, and it keeps you active.

To begin with, Completing one activity could lead to new friendship. For example, My friend had just made the soccer team and had no clue who any of his teammates were. There was another student who had made the team who wasn't familiar with his teammates, so my friend and him became best friends. Another example is, When doing the yearbook the two girls fought to see who could get the best pictures so they can be announced best photographer, when one of the girl's trampled over a crowd of football players and broke her camera. The other girl stopped what she was doing to come help her, yet knowing she was always mean to her and showed no respect. Because of this, Friendship can occur when you least expect it in tough times. There is always someone out there that just wants to be your friend. New friends lead to more fun.

Secondly, Students have most fun when they can be themselves. To illustrate, When playing your favorite sport, or doing your after school activity. You get to run, play, talk, and be free. All things you only can do every once in a while in school. Most of all you can be your self. To further show, Signing up to do Chess club, Art club, and Robotics are all fun and interesting things to do after school. One robotics team got to go kings dominion because there tournament was so close. As a result, Having fun is the most precious things you can have while being a student. You can be free with knowing theres no limits to having fun and being active.

Finally, Being active while being a student is healthy. To show, Scientist have found that 3/4 of the student population is not being active. Students have not been productive after school hours, so the school boards have gotten together, and decided to have after school activities to keep students healthy and productive after school. Additionally, Students can choose there activity to complete or try out for a sport. This way it's better to keep the students more engaged with the school, yet keep them active. Therefor, keeping students in a chair for six hours is not always gonna keep the students energetic for the whole entire day.

In conclusion,""Don't expect someones success to come to you, follow your own path to success"" -Nike. To further explain, Students can take what class they like. Most students take classes there friends take, but never understood why they took that class when there not good at it. Same as an extracurricular activity. Students can take what ever activity they want for their reasons. Students should agree with having to take one extracurricular class because, it leads to new friendships, students have lots of fun, and it keeps them active. Instead of students being bored all day. They can take one activity of their choosing, while having fun, and being social with other kids. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
9C61ACA70773,"Did you know its proven that extracurricular activities boost student academic performance in subjects they are taking? Well I for one agree with the principal's decision (that every student should take at least one extracurricular activity).This is because of my satisfactory experience with soccer for the school varsity team; soccer as an extracurricular activity for me has been beneficial in ways such as providing me and teaching me principles/essential fundamentals that are used in real life scenarios (such as collaboration, and team-work),it is a productive break from school, and soccer has kept me in good shape and, physically in a healthy condition because of practice, and other things required to play the sport. So because I took soccer and it has helped me with those aspects in characteristic traits,being a productive break, and keeping me healthy, everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity and abide by the principals decision.

One reason to take an extracurricular activity such as soccer and support my position is because it guides students into learning traits like collaboration,team work, and communication (components used in soccer), and they carry out to a students daily life. For example before I took soccer as an extracurricular activity I didn't know how to work with people and that lead to me doing bad in group assignments; we had one for science where we worked on a environmental poster I did not know when to share Idea's,take leadership, or surprisingly how to ask for help! However, when I took soccer we worked on those fundamentals (in training you learn how to pass, how to ask for the ball, and how to get support from your teammates,etc). Those ideals carried on to my personal life and I noticed I started having better coordination with my peers in the science project (also just groups in general). Therefore all students should take at least one extracurricular activity so they learn the vital skills such as the ones I learned in soccer which improves coordination,communication,collaboration, and many more; these skills carry onto daily life for a student and make real life scenarios easier to deal with.

Another way soccer has benefited me and proves every student should take an extracurricular activity is because they act as productive breaks from school. Studies have shown students spend about 2 hours on their phone daily, we can all infer these 2 hours were spent on their free time because phones aren't allowed to be used in school. This fact is accurate for me because before I took soccer, I spent most of my time for recreation on my phone; it acted as a very unproductive break and didn't benefit me in any way (all I did was scroll through social media), but that all changed when I emerged my self into soccer. Those hours I spent on my phone were all replaced with productive training and it was more enjoyable than scrolling through Instagram; I also found my self less guilty and soccer provided me benefits way more superior then just staying at home and doing nothing with my time of leisure (such as the benefits listed in this essay, healthiness,a guide of skills,etc). Ultimately, students should be required to take an extracurricular activity such as soccer because of how they act as productive breaks from the useless addictions of teens such as phones,video games, and many more, and they provide more benefits then those leisurely activities.

Finally, the last reason to support the principals decision is because extracurricular activities like soccer or regarding sports, and activities that get adolescents moving, make them physically more healthy and make exercise fun for students. My personal problem used to be weight ;before I took soccer I was 5'10 and 160 pounds I found exercise UN-enjoyable, and was on my way to face the huge problem of

""American Obesity"". Since I loved the sport so much I naturally lost 30 lb; since soccer requires a lot of cardiovascular training such as running. I also found my self doing other exercises to help my self get better at the sport such as swimming,yoga, and much more! It is a known fact that people who are more fit tend to look after them selves, and move around much more than the ""average Joe."" Therefore, extracurricular activities such as soccer are important and one should be taken by at least every student because they provide a healthy amount of exercise (that is enjoyable), in a students daily life, and can solve problem such as being over-weight.

In conclusion I support the principals decision to require extracurricular activities for every student. Because of my experience with taking soccer has provided me traits relevant to real life scenarios such as team work,collaboration and many more other traits important for real life, It acted as a productive recreational activity while substituting for my phone usage, and at last it has made me a healthier student, and stopped me to my path to obesity. So whether its soccer,football,media communications for the school,or any other activity I cannot stress enough the importance of extracurricular activities, and I definitely agree with the principals decision for the requirement. The fact extracurricular activities are proven to boost student performance in subjects is more than enough of a reason to partake on an activity, don't you think?         ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
2D765BC7C9E4,"Dear Reader

I would say yes to having an extracurricular activity in school cause it could be healthy, could get you to quit being lazy, and might teach you a valuable lesson for the future. The reason why I may think this could be a benefit to your life is because it helped me alot. You should try it at some point and see how you like it.

People ask all the time how is this healthy. I think this is healthy because in some of the activities you are getting exercise. Exercise is helping people lose weight everyday. If you think about it can also help your body for lots of things. Dont put your body in to much pain though.

It might help people with their lazyness although they still might reject sports. It could get them up out of bed to talk with some new really good freinds. It might honestly do a lot of things like they actually have fun. It would definietly get some kids off the video games. Like my Brother for example. What do you think about how this can also get kids off other things?

I know some of these things has definitly tought me some valuable lessons for the future. I mean you could change this world.

With these lessons in your head, it could change your family if you share, or teach the lessons to them. Have you ever learned a valuable lesson in life from a extracurricular activities?

These are my reasons for why I would have kids in school have the extracurricular activities for their health, lazyness, and last but not least, the lessons they could learn.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
A48C41EEA09B,"Sure extracurricular activities are fun for some students, but if you try to make a kid who is already stressed out with school work and add more to their load it could make some students break down! When and if your principal or teacher brings up the situation they are probably only thinking about the benefits, and not the down sides. Some students would be just fine with this because they are already in one of those activities or sports, but for someone who are not, it will probably cause them to worry, (which we don't need that). Therefore I disagree that all students should be required at least one extracurricular activity because most teachers give homework, there would be no time to take care of pets or do chores, and it would just create more stress to add to student's everyday lives.

First of all, most teachers give homework to their students every night. If students also have activities in the afternoon there are so many bad things that could come from that. One thing that could happen is students rush through their work and don't do it the way it should be done. It would be just like telling a bunch of high school students,"" here you have twenty minutes to right a two page essay"". Another reason could be if students have a lot of homework and stay up late at night to get it done they will come to school the next day tired, or even be late for school in general. The last way this can affect kids is if they do not get their homework done they can start to fail their classes. For these reasons I feel it would be unfair to require students to have these activities!

Secondly, I know that there is a huge amount of people and kids that have chores when they get home from work or, in this case, school. If kids have to go to their extra activities they will either end up not doing their chores or rushing through them and not getting them done well. Also research has shown that there are more families in the United States today that have pets than there are that don't. If kids have these extracurricular activities then when are they going to find the time to take care of their pets. These are just a few more reasons why I disagree with this decision.

Lastly, I know I mentioned it before but I will say it again, if students are required to do even just one extra activity it will just add more unneeded stress to their plate! Students already have enough stress in their lives that have to do with their lives at home, their grades, and drama at school. Also, if this were to really happen there would be a lot of kids that would feel insecure, or feel like they aren't good enough to do certain activities! I know that if this happened at my school I would be one of those students. There you have it, just one more great reason why we should not let this happen.

In conclusion, students should not be required to do an extracurricular activity because, students have homework, they have chores and pets to take care of, and they don't need the extra stress that will come with these activities. Kids should have the freedom to do as they please, (most of the time, anyway), and they should not have to do anything they don't want to do! If this is happening where you live and you don't agree, feel free to use some of this info to persuade your principal or teacher to not let activities continue to be a requirement!",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
3BD4C7E7DE37,"Hello i'm Generic_Name and i'm here to talk about an idea i've heard that just sounds crazy. Do you ever want to go home after a long day at school and want to relax, eat, or even nap? Well with this idea of requiring all students to do an after school activity completely kills the relaxing dream. I believe these three reasons should give you an idea on why we should not be required to do an extracurricular activity. First after a long day at school we are tired, students also might be independent or antisocial, finally some kids are not healthy enough to be doing after school activities. These are all things the principal should take to account before implementing this idea.

First reason I believe we should be allowed to choose if we do an activity after school is that we the students are very tired in the regard that we wake up extremely early and must get ready to go to school. Another example of being tired is after waking up for school we proceed to work for 7hrs and learn. The final piece of evidence is that we through out the school day we do not get time to relax and take a breather to process all this information we took in for the day. so after all this going through our day we definitely need a break to relax. I dont know about you but I definitely need a nap after such a day. These are just some examples on why students would be tired and not want to do extracurricular activities.

The second reason we should be offered a choice to do after school activities is that lots of teens in this day and age are independent or antisocial. Some kids would prefer to work alone and just be by themselves. I know when I work alone I plug my headphones in and crank the volume to my music and jam along while I work or play. Another preference for students is that being in the comfort of your home and knowing your alone and can say whatever you want makes them feel comfortable and helps them focus on working. The final reason that some kids prefer to be independent is that you dont have to worry someone else is smarter or better than you. you can just know that you are the only person you have to worry about and being alone helps with that. In my personal life I know some people judge and that would slow me down and i would focus on there comment. So being independent is another reason I would dislike the after school idea.

The third and final reason I disagree with this decision is that, some teens are in health matters and are not healthy enough to do things after school. If a child has a mental barrier or a setback that can stop them from performing like other students. I know about some kids that have speech impediments so if they were to play on a sports team it would be extremely challenging because communication is important. A lot of teens in America are also overweight and are not cut out for playing sports or being on a team. Finally some kids are injured and are healing with a cast or a neck brace, witch stops them from participating in sports or writing if they cannot use there dominant hand. I had an infection in my finger not long ago and I take piano so when i tried to play I was stopped by the injury and it was holding me down.

So in conclusion to all these reasons, being tired after a long day at school, having health issues or injures, and having a preference of being alone, I still believe that we should be offered the choice and power to choose if we would like to participate in an extracurricular activity. Just think about how nice it would be to get to relax after the long stressful day at at school. Besides teachers or adults dont want to have to deal with kids after they did for a whole day right? So I hope that this idea is just an idea and we should think about the challenges kids face and keep things the way they are. I love being able to go home crack open a water bottle have a apple and watch YouTube.

9C8A7156AB27,"POV (Point Of View): Talking to a group of students in hopes of convincing them to join extracurricular activities and giving them a little bit of insight on the benefits of them.

It's a common and widely spread opinion to think that school is dreadful. Some students wake up with no other goal than trying to get through their day as quickly as possible. It is true that the concept of school itself can be very over-whelming, especially when everyday feels like a repeat of yesterday. I believe that there are a few ways to make students look forward to going to school, and that is extracurricular activities. Even if you don't want to participate simply because you don't want to involve yourself at all in anything school related, it's still important that you do a minimum of one extracurricular activities. If you think about it, all students, like yourselves, are required to attend school everyday regardless, so why not try making your own personal stay a little more enjoyable?

There's a variety of activities to choose from. If some students are not the sporty type, there are plenty of non physically-active activities still available. These activities are usually non-school related unless you choose it to be. Not only are you given the opportunity to choose what activity you think suits you best, but these activities give you time to yourself everyday to distract your brain from obtaining knowledge constantly and instead putting your mind at ease for a while whilst still being somewhat productive. Some of these activities may already be ones that you do normally as hobbies such as drawing, acting, playing an instrument and/or sport.

Depending on what activity you choose, you may get the chance to improve your skills in things you may be struggling in such as Math, writing, English, etc. If you're lucky, you may find an activity that will inspire and guide any passions you have. The great thing about being able to choose what you want to sign up for as an extracurricular activity is that chances are, you'll most likely be able to find something you're interested in or perhaps find out about talents/skills you weren't aware you ever had! Some of the singers and/or actresses/actors that you see today are only here because their talents were discovered as little children in places such as schools. Maybe participating in one activity will help you unlock a new passion for something as well.

Many schools offer clubs or activities that some may find boring or useless but still significant for your knowledge. Clubs such as Self Defense Club is one that will teach you the manners and logistics on how to defend and protect yourself in certain situations. There have even been times where knowing these life-saving tips have spared someones life. You never know what people are capable of, especially being surrounded with many people you don't know personally in school. One of the most important benefits of signing up for an activity is friendship. If you sign up, everyone else will want to too and that increases the probability of you meeting someone who's interested in the same hobbies as you. Numerous activities available for sign-up in schools are beneficial and fun and could help you shape your future, so thinking twice would be a wise decision!

It's safe to say that extracurricular activities aren't hurting anyone. If anything, they bring people together and help you familiarize yourself with what catches your eye and what doesn't. If you're someone that's scared to exit your comfort zone just remember; Comfort zones are your quota, they are a comfortable and familiar place, but nothing ever grows there.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
D0C00F3D38E3,"Do you really believe that all kids should do an extracurricular activity after school? Well, I do and so does the principal at my school. Also, an extracurricular activity dosen't always have to be a sport. It can be working on the yearbook, joining different clubs, or it could be a sport. I agree with this decision because it gets children more active, helps them communicate with other students, and just to do something instead of being at home.

Firstly, the decision makes children more active by doing things to keep them moving. There are different activities in the sports catergory to keep children moving and active. The activites consist of cheer,soccer, baseball, softball. tennis, etc. There are also inside activites such as volleyball, swim team, and basketball. Those were some examples of activites you could do to get kids active.

Furthermore, this decision helps children communiate with other students. Normally, children are shy when they meet other kids, but joining different activites throughout the years wouldnt be so hard to talk to other students. Kids often don't talk when joining new activites beacuse of the lack of communication or the lack of knowing the other students. I know this from experience. Joining extracurricular activites will help with communication around the school.

Lastly, students should just want to do something instead of being at home. I wouldn't like to be at home all day knowing I could be at home all day knowing I could be doing something fun at school. Most kids like to stay home and be bored, but little do they know, they could be in different types of activites after school. I also do activites after school, because i don't wan't to be at home doing nothing. Students doesn't like to stay at home anyway.

The decision of making all kids do activites is agreeable. They should be more active, communicate with more students, and should want to do something instead of being home. I believe that if all students at my school do extracurricular activites that the school would be a little but more fun. The students at the school would be more into ging to school.          ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
2B39201EEEE0,"""Are you joking me? I barely have enough time to do my homework and study, now I have to do an extracurricular activity? I can't do this anymore, I have to give up.""

I have to give up.

Those words could be said by any student. Giving up is something I'm sure no teacher or principal would ever want their student to do; however, since now that you have to take another activity, it is very possible that it will be said and done. We should not be forced to have an extracurricular activity because it prevents choice, gives more stress, and it has the potential to make students stop trying to learn and quitting.

When it comes to me, I think everyone should have freedom of choice or opinion. No one should be limited to either of them. Forcing students to have an extracurricular activity is directly violating the freedom of choice that I always believe in. Let's say for instance a student does not want to take a sport or a activity because he/she always goes to a friends house after school for homework or that they just don't want to do it. Well now, he/she is denied of that choice because he/she is forced to take a sport or a job in the school. Just from forcing to play a sport or having to something for the school, all kinds of situations could erupt that aren't good at all. The right to have a choice is very important and we shouldn't be denied of that. That's why we should not be forced to have an extracurricular activity.

You might not think it but no one wants to have stress. Not even people that say they want to have stress. Some students have a very tight schedule and can't add anything else to it. Their day is filled to the brim with things to do and it is stressful enough already. Giving that, imagine how stressful they would get when the principal said that they had to do an extracurricular activity and they had no choice. It would be like a death sentence to them. I got a lot of stress too back then, and it was not pretty. Worrying and being desperate are not things I would want other students or me to experience. Having to have an activity to do for school is a breeze for some students; to others though, it could be quite the opposite. Forcing students to have an extracurricular activity has a negative effect instead of a positive one on students.

Quitting is not an option

-unknown.

Well, it could be now for Generic_School. Students are like houses. Let's say each wall for the student is like a thing in their life.

Amount of fun, learning, homework, stress, etc. You have to put an equal amount of material and size into it. You can't add too much to one side or too small to the other. If so, the house would break down and in other words, the student will also break down. Let's now say a student named Generic_Name was on the brink of collapsing for his house. He was managing well enough to keep it intact and he didn't have time for an activity. Now that the principal of the student forces all students to take an extracurricular activity, what do you think would happen to his house? I would know. His house would break down; Therefore, Generic_Name could not handle it anymore and gave up. Like I said before, no teacher or principal would want their student to quit so forcing to have an extracurricular activity on students would not end up well at all.

I believe that everyone should have a right to choose what they want.

In school and everywhere. Giving up though, should not be a choice. Whether its having to play a sport for school, working on a job, whatever it is. We should not be forced to have an extracurricular activity because it prevents choice, gives more stress, and it has the potential to make students stop trying to learn and give up. A little thing, like needing to participate in a school activity, could and can have a big impact on us people.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
420D3018845E,"I agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school because it is an excellent way to find interests in leisure time, improve people's social and health lives, and it has an important role in serving the community and academic success.

First of all, many students, especially teenagers, spend a vast amount of time on social medias and cellular devices. It may lead to negative consequences such as lack of self-control and self-management, imperfect grades, and even cyberbullying. Before students become mature enough to handle their own situations, adults should be the supervisors and help them get on the right track. Sometimes it is acceptable to force people to on a certain task for their own benefits. Therefore, extracurricular activities is a great option when it comes to after school life. Students may seek their true interests through these experiences and even more, find the purpose of their lives. For instance, a student who participates in a the student council may find a big interest in politics or management; another student who works on the yearbook might seek a great favor in arts and photography. Moreover, there is a possibility that some people can target what they want to major in for the future.

Additionally, extracurricular activities may contribute to students' health and social lives by creating opportunities such as teamwork and group projects. Besides focusing on school grades, students should also pay attention on developing relationships and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, all of these are going to be helpful for having great experiences in the society. Many students crave for a sense of belonging and they often find unexpected gains in extracurricular activities such as friendship or a healthy life style. For example, playing sports can exercise your body and strengthen your muscles, when people get older, it can even prevent typical diseases for a longer life span. Also, sport teams often develop communication and teamwork skills, through these activities, students are able to make new friends by talking about topics that they are interested in, and these relationships can also be a source of strength when people come into challenges and difficulties in life. It is a positive way for students to be physically and mentally prepared for the future.

Furthermore, extracurricular activities is a nice way to contribute to the school and it can even be beneficial to academic success. School provides an educational environment for students and students can participate in activities such as school board or the announcements and news program to serve back to the school. In a way, it has the same meaning and purpose as community service, it advocates for serving others and offers many experience that are helpful to the society. On the other hand, participating in extracurricular activities may serve as a great advantage in high school or college applications, every school looks forward to accepting students who are willing to spend effort on things that they are interested in, and at the same time know the importance of serving back to the community.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities have many benefits for students' academic and after school lives such as finding one's personal interests, adding more values to one's social and health life, and lastly, serving the community while being grateful for nice things in the world. With all these advantages, I think it would be a beneficial decision to suggest students to engage in extracurricular activities.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
A6759897BBE1,"Students have an increased chance of getting into to trouble if they aren't occupied by something good. For example, an extracurricular activity.

For example sports or clubs provided at the school. Extracurricular activities are not just for fun but for learning,experience and building the confidence of one another.

Experiences are a crucial part of life. That's what you use to build yourself in the future. For example when I was in kindergarten, we were playing with blocks . I had a blue red and purple castle. It was built so high , it almost reached the ceiling. When my teacher called for snack time, I got up and we all traveled to the cafeteria like a school of fish. While I was munching on my goldfish and sipping on my apple juice, Generic_Name had snuck back to the classroom and knocked down all the kids castles and went back to the cafeteria. When we got back to the classroom we were horrified. Everybodies blocks that were once formed into beautiful castles, were now sad little piles of colors. When the teacher had saw what happened she looked at Generic_Name and said "" Where were you during lunch?"" He burst into tears and explained why he did it. "" I didn't mean to I was just so angry because my castle wouldn't stay up so II'm knocked ours down. I'm so sorry you guys ,"" Afterwards he got sent to the principals and didn't come back until tomorrow. From that experience, I learned that just because you can't make it doesn't mean you have to stop others, just ask for help.

In extracurricular activities you have the chance to learn from others. For example the first extracurricular activity I took was dance. I had a lot of fun in that class. I learned new techniques from the older kids and I now am able to pass those steps to the younger ones when I get older. On the first day however, I was nervous. I thought they wouldn't like me . I thought they'd judge me. To my surprise, when we did dances I was always shy because we are all here to do the same thing dance freely, so I quickly gained my confidence an started getting to work going ""Full-out"" which leads me to my next point.

People are always lowering other's self esteem because of how low theirs is. They think that if someone's is higher then theirs, they are going to be targeted. That's not always true . For example when I first started going to extracurricular activities, I didn't know anybody. I walked in the library with books in my hand and a nervous look on my face . I sat ow at a table alone when a girl and her friend walked over . They asked if they could sit there and I said sure. We got along quite well I made them laugh they made me laugh and we had a fun time so we got each others phone numbers and started talking all the time. Since then, I have met some amazing new friends that will always be there for me when need them .

I believe that it is most important for my principal to make it mandatory that every student participate in atleast one extracurricular activity. The experience is amazing an your confidence and friendships will increase which can lead you to a great school year.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
86DC4C84C053,"So our principal has made a new rule that everyone must do an extracurricular activity. This is debated by people. Do these extracurricular activities benefit kids?

I agree with my prinicipal. This is a great idea, a healthy way of school for students. The students get to meet new people and possibly make new friends, and if they join a club or a team with their friends they can play with them. For sports they get to work together as a team and do their best. For clubs they can solve issues or help out the school with things like the yearbook club and student council. These clubs and sports teams are very fun with friends and meeting new people and making friends is even better!

This also gives something for students to do. Instead of going home and immedietly playing video games or waiting for the weekend this gives students an opportunity to do something after school instead of going home and getting bored. This also makes students more social and talkative. By having to work with new people and building relationships with people and this is where you make new friends! By having good social skills and being able to be coached or cabable of working with others helps you get known as a fun person to play or work with in clubs. Also if you are good at it it's even better!

This can also help the school. With clubs this can help the school get things done like the yearbook and the student council can make decisions on what to move forward with. Sports can help raise money for the school with fundraisers, and their success might help too. This also helps the school improve by solving problems like fixing broken items or getting jerrseys etc. When the school doesn't have many problems than everyone is ok and nobody is unhappy with the school

Having after school activities is good. This helps kids and helps the school. Kids get tthe opportunity to make friends, play fun sports and help the school. This benefits lots of people and will make people happy.                                                             ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
4B8DA6C2D322,"Should the principle force people to do extracurricular activities like sport, work on the yearbook or serve in the student council?

I do not agree with this because the student shouldn't be force to do stuff is fine if the students wants to do then but they shouldn be force to do then.

For example the principle is forcing people to do sport but there is a kid that can do sport because they have problem of walking he shouldn be force to do sport because he can do the sport because he's leg are in some condition.

The activity are helpful for students, that by doing this activities they can learn more stuff that can be helpful for the future but shouldn't be force to do then.

What if the student is force to work on the yearbook but he mes up on a yearbook of someone and that someone complains to the office, the fault of messing up the yearbook is that person who created the yearbook. and that person that mes up the yearbook is getting in trouble for messing the yearbook.

So the conclusion for this is that they shoudn be force to do this kind of things like sport, work on the yearbook or serve in the student council. ",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
C18DA1185654,"If the principle decided on if everyone had to do an activity school would be not in good shape including that there is many reasons why this shouldn't happen. People who are in school has a higher chance of not liking school than liking it. Students have more pressure doing extra activities it is just like adding more school to school. There's more reasons for which this idea is unreliable.

There has been studies proven on which students don't like the facts on which school starts at 7:30 am in middle school which students have to wake up about at 6:00 for the bus so people have been thinking to start school somewhere near 10:00 or 9:00 which that also is aggravating of an idea because that would cause school to end at like 5:00. Some students do like school then they will volunteer for these activities there for students shouldn't be forced to do these activities. Doing sports takes time from doing homework which benefits your actual education. School is roughly about 6 hours and 45 minutes on which this goes for more than half the year and estimated students get 2 and a half months break.

There is no time to do any activities in school so that means the activities are after school. as proven this will basically add more time to school since everyone has an activity after school. The fact that most students don't like school it should mean that the principal won't give them extra work for things they may not like even though they can choose their activity, maybe all of their favorite activities are taken so they have to find an activity they don't like. this constructs the purpose on behalf that students should not be forced to do activities.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

By deciding to stay after school, you've signed up for tons of fun! You can do homework with peers, participate in fun activities, and maybe even meet your new best friend!

There's a vast variety of awesome activities to take part in, and you can choose to do whichever ones you want. Do you want to create art? Join the art club! Do you want to compete in sports? There are plenty to choose from! There are so many activities that you're bound to find yourself having fun with something! If you don't understand something in one of your regular classes, you can go to your teacher for help! That's right, teachers stay after school too! There's something for everyone.

Since you choose what activities you want to participate in, it is likely that you'll meet others with similar interests to your own. There are many different types of people you could meet after school. It's nearly impossible not to get along with at least one person. I'm not saying you'll like everyone you meet, but it's only logical that you'll find someone nice.

Clearly, having a rule requiring extra-curricular activities wouldn't be so bad. It's fun and exciting. So much so that most people would probably do it anyways. Even without the rule that requires it. I don't believe that there's anything wrong with this awesome new rule.    ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
3.69E+11,"Would you believe me if I told you that any sort of extracurricular activity would help you later on in life? Well believe me it really does and that's why I strongly agree with our principal making this rule. It won't only help you with important lifelong skills you will also make new friends. If you don't like sports there is many other activities to participate in. So these next few paragraphs will tell you all about why I agree with our principal.

One of the most common activities is school sport teams. Not only do you make new friends from it you also learn one of the most important life lessons. Teamwork is extremely important to me because you will need it for the rest of your life. Sport teams is also a great way to stay healthy and in shape. And if you are competitive in any way you will fall in love with sports.

Teamwork is a great life skill to have no matter what you do. Whatever job you do as a adult you will need teamwork to make it a sucesfull business. You need to be able to work with your co-workers to come up with ideas for your business. If you are independent you usually don't make it very far. More people will always think better than one.

If you don't like sports and aren't competitive don't stress there is still activities for you! If you enjoy stuff like yearbook club, student council, writing or anything that's considered a club you can still do an activity and enjoy it. You get the same leadership and lifelong skills you get from sports while still having fun. It's hard to make friends with the same interests but if you join a club you find many people with the same interests as you. And your'e also having fun while you learn or work.

Any one of these two things are important to do for later and life. You may not like or principals choice but I know you will one day. He's doing it for our best so we can be even better people. There is many choices to pick from so you will never feel like it's forced. I hope this opened you up to everything our school offers.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
C29A6FAADF82,"I disagree but at the same time i agree with it, because that i feel like the students should get to choose if they want to participate in an activity involving school, its not really the principle job to make the students participate in an school activity. The principle shouldn't have that rule because he don't know whats going on at home, students might have a funeral to go to, they might have to visit a relative and that is some of the reasons why he shouldnt have the rule.

another reason he shouldn't have the rule is because some people might have to go to work, kids might have to go to work is to help pay the bills around the house and some people with a single parent often tend to getting a job so they won't get evicted from there house, and people try to keep the bills payed so they can have warm water and cool air in the house so they can survive and if the school try to make the rule official it will cut off time for work and the bills won't get paid in time.

a second reason he shouldn't have the rule is family plans, sometimes family plan things to get to gather in there free time like a family cook out, going to a restaurant,and just going out and having fun with relatives, since the rule is you have to join a school program it will give you less time to spend time with your family especially if you choose sports because sports are after school.

but i agree with it because the principle just want students to get involved with school and after school programs so everyone has something fun to do in there free time and help the kids stay out of trouble and do something productive with thereselfs and get to meet new people and make friends around the school and thats how i aggre withe the rule.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

But most of the little amount of kids that disagree are the kids that say ""I dont have time for this"" and they would rather be at home playing video games,sleeping,or texting there friends. Me personally i dont like this new rule because school is already seven hours away from hour family and from daylight so why make it any longer. A lot of kids dont get to see there parents that much because they are struggling with money so they have to work longer or maybe there parents are really sick and have to stay in the hospital. Another reason is they dont have good athletic ability and they might get bullied for looking weird while running,throwing a ball,or while catching a ball. So i disagree on this rule and they need to change it. If you really think about this new rule you really realize all the bad effects compared to the good effects and there are more bad effects. When you look at the bad effects you realize one kid could be getting bullied for the way he or she runs and you dont change the rule then your really just letting bullying continue.

Extracurricular activity's is not a good chose because a lot of students dont like going to school,and dont like to participate in activity's. The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with his dissection because most of the students will not want to participate in a activity. The students will just sit there and do nothing or they'll fall asleep. And there are more reasons why students should not always participate in activities.

The principal made that rule but the students that dont want to do it they'll get in trouble. And for them getting in to much trouble it can affect there life and also it can affect there grads. Students should have the right to choose what they want and what they dont want,because it would not be fair. For example,The students needed stay after school for an activity but they couldn't go. The extracurricular activity's are great sometimes because you have more time to hang out with your friends and stuff,but when they dont let you then thats when students get mad. I would not join an activity because when i get home i dont have time to do all my stuff at home. Students get annoyed when teacher tell them to do something they dont want to.

All the schools from Generic_City have good and bad rules. They dont let you do what you want to do even sometimes you get in trouble for not going to your activities. Students often dont have time to be doing activities or they dont have much important to them. Also they can be scared to go because their scared to get bulled by someone. Their are many reasons why students should not participate in activities. If a student picks a sport like soccer they can get hurt in many ways and in some other sports. People get bored when their just sitting their listening to the teacher. They also can get distracted easily and then they get in trouble for talking. The teachers can also be to much they get mad if your chewing gum in class and then they be like ""IM GOING TO GIVE YOU A REFFERL FOR CHEWING GUM.""

The teachers can make some other fun activity's so the students can enjoy there time with there friends. Some students can be lazy to even think about doing activities. I mean a lot of people out there can have different ideas some dont think the same like others do. The county should make more activities that are excited so students can go and learn more stuff so they can understand that maybe activities can not be that bad.

603D3019DCC5,"Fun is subjective. Everyone sees fun a different way. For instance, someone might see fun as throwing a ball back and forth with a friend, while someone else finds fun in instant gratification in online video games. Others, on the contrary, find fun in discovering new and innovative ways of counting prime numbers and memorizing absurd amounts of digits of pi. These people also frequently get the short side of the stick when it comes to decisions majorly accepted as fun. This consists of extracurricular activities such as sports and inter murals. Although this is a particularly opinionated based subject, it is also one worth mentioning. I believe that students should not be obliged to take part in extracurricular activities because students are overwhelmed with considerably more important subjects such as mathematics and English, students have a lack of free time as it is, and most people would rather do extracurricular activities at home rather than at school.

People are overwhelmed during school with other things besides extracurricular activities. For instance, most students find themselves dumbfounded when trying to reflect on what the teacher has said in the past hour of not being able to focus. This is most likely due to sleep deprivation or stress. One plausible explanation to explain why a student might not get enough sleep at night is because he or she spent too much time studying or doing homework when he or she should have been sleeping. This is a problem not only because of the lack of energy during integral class time, but also because it causes stress. When students suddenly realize that there is an upcoming test the next morning or there is a massive project due the very next day that they have not even taken a crack at, stress is typically a resulting factor. Even if the student does get to sleep early, he or she may not be able to fall asleep or stay asleep the whole night because of the stress caused by the assignment or assignments due. This will only get built upon when adding even one mandatory extracurricular activity. This is a crucial problem occurring to students, but when asked, they are not willing to admit it to authority figures or even their parents. Therefore, students should not be obliged to participate in extracurricular activities because they might already be overwhelmed with seemingly more important subjects.

Students do not get enough free time as it is. Hypothetically speaking, after coming home from a long day at school, a student might want to play for a bit before getting started on his or her arduous homework. From a brief look at the clock, the student realizes that there is no time to play and decides to start on his or her homework while he or she still can. Because the homework that was given to he or she was too much to handle, he or she still did not manage to finish his or her homework even though he or she did set aside play time. While this is no anecdote, a lot of real students go through this, myself included. This, along with the additional extracurricular activity that is probable to give even more homework, proves that students are already incapable of completing homework assignments because they do not get enough free time to do so. Therefore, adding the mandatory extracurricular activities will only drag down the amount of free time students have to have fun and play.

I may not be the perfect candidate to speak on everyone's behalf, however, I think that most people would rather do extracurricular activities such as sports at home rather than at school. This is probably because no matter how hard they try, the school never executes their plans correctly. Also, if and when someone does do it at home by his or her self, he or she would normally have a lot more fun and feel a lot more accomplished with the activities because there are no limits when it comes to creativity and imagination. Therefore, I encourage imagination by not wanting to have one or more mandatory extracurricular activity at school because the students will probably not like it if the activities were set up by the school.

To conclude, I do not think that each and every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students grow easily overwhelmed and stressed out over other subjects such as mathematics, students have a lack of free time as it is, and most people who would like to do extracurricular activities would probably like to do them at home by themselves.

Here is the first reason why students should join activities. Students can make new friends and meet new people if they are in an activity with a group. For example, when I started doing orchestra I made lots of new friends and I met people that I didn't even knew went to my school; also that were in some of my other classes. When I moved up to other orchestras I made more and more friends. I am really glad I joined, because then I wouldn't have met all those people and my friends. Also you might find someone who has the same interests as you do and you can maybe be try and be their friend.

The second reason why students should be in one or more activities. When students have joined a after school activity or just a during school activity or even an elective. Some students have said that the activities they are in became their new hobbies and they found out that they were actually good at it. If you join a activity and you really like it maybe you can make a career out of it. Isn't that how most famous sports players became so good at the sport and make lots of money. It's because they might have tried out the sport during school or even after. They figured out that they were really good at it. So they tried for leagues and other sport events and made it their career. So maybe if you join an activity you might be surprised and find out you are good at it.

Here is the last reason why I think students should join one or more activities. When people have join and activity they might have learned about something that they never knew was a thing or maybe just something cool to do. For example when you join soccer you can learn lots of tricks and cool things you can do with the ball. Also when I joined orchestra I never knew how to do any cool hand positions and shift up on the strings. But throughout the years of me playing I learned mostly all the things to know. Also I learned about new people who played the same instrument as me. So join something, you can learn lots of new things.

Throughout this whole essay you have read about why students should join a extracurricular activity. Examples like you can learn new things, meet new people and make new friends, and people found out that they were good at the activity. So the next time you see a flier posted up about an activity. Give it a try you might find out that you really like it and find out you are really good at the sport or whatever you choose to do.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
E7111F690B98,"I agree with the principal and most people just hang around and dont do any work. Kids need to start being more happy and play sports and enjoy life. At certain schools around the world Students act bad and just act up in general at school, and teachers dont seem to do things about it. If kids played sports more the school would gain a good reputaion. Sports are always fun, more people need to get there gets in sports like how the schools wants them too

I believe that we should have all schools make kids certain sports, in certain times of the day. Like In elementary school you have gym after a class. We should tell parents that would want there kids to do activities that they would enjoy. If we had Students playing sports everyday then lots of people would be happy, plus who doesn't like to have fun once in awhile. If you wanna get on to the yearbook you need to be good in class and have good grades. If you do good things like help the teacher out they might take a picture and post you on there, saying something like ""This person helped me do something difficult"".

In order to be a student councilor, you need to understand others in a way that you can help them if they need it. Also you need to be a decent person and very understanding. Some kids may come if they need someone to talk to or are having trouble at home. As a student councilor you have very many responsabities such as caring and helping others when they need you. In our future we should all be happy and enjoy life. Schools should let students play sports and be a councilor or be in the year book. Parents should let there kids be a little more free.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
D5C7CD75E324,"Many students at our school are furious with the principal's new decision that requires students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities are any activities that take place after the school day at school or one's school-related. A few examples of the many extracurricular activities our school offers are playing on the school's sports team, working on the yearbook, or serving on school council. I agree with our principal's decision stating all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will be able to explore new interests and feel a greater connection with their school.

Exploring new interests and learning about yourself is an important part about growing up, and extracurricular activities do a great job providing this. I participate in some of the fun extracurricular activities at our school and I've been able to learn new things about myself, such as I enjoy cooking. When I heard that our school offered a cooking club I thought that sounded like something fun, but at the time I didn't know much about cooking. I was worried I'd be bad at it, but I decided to join anyways since I had always wanted to try and learn to cook. By participating in cooking club I was able to make new friends that I would have never met if I hadn't joined. Also, I realized that cooking was actually something I enjoyed a lot and am pretty good at. Since it's now mandatory that students participate in extracurricular activities, they could join a club that they may have never thought they'd like, but by joining they could realize it's something they genuinely enjoy and are good at.

It's important that you like school and have school spirit since school is a place where you spend so much of your time. Not many middle schools have sports teams, but I think it's really cool that our school allows us to have a basketball team for both genders and both grade levels that plays against another local middle school one night. The week leading up to the game is super fun because it's a spirit week, and everyone gets to go to school dressed up and showcasing their school spirit. Going to the basketball game is such a fun extracurricular activity to participate in since you get to cheer for all of your classmates that worked hard, you get to show your school spirit, and you get to have a fun time in a new environment with your friends. Extracurricular activities really allow you to have school spirit and enjoy things in school that go beyond your daily classes.

Students being able to explore new interests and feeling a greater connection with their school is something important that extracurricular activities are able to provide. Since you must participate in an extracurricular activity now, students could join a club that they wouldn't have previously, and they could possibly find out that it's something their interested in and good at. As well as learning about yourself, extracurricular activities give students the opportunity to have a deeper connection with their school by allowing you to get the chance to enjoy something that isn't apart of your daily school schedule. I truly believe that the principal made an outstanding decision making it mandatory that students participate in at least one extracurricular activity in hopes to make the school a better place. Now go ahead and learn about some of the other amazing extracurricular activities our school offers!",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
B7B158E7E87B,"Tick, tick, tick. Ring! School is out for the day! Or maybe not? Your principle is making everyone at your school join in a extracurricular activity after school. All of your friends are talking about how they won't be able to go to their sports practices after school and other activities that they enjoy. I do not agree that every student should have to participate in a after school extracurricular activity.

One reason I do not agree that every student should have to participate in a after school extracurricular activity is that some students already have a activity to go and do after school. According to statistics at Generic_School 43% of all of their students have activities outside of school on school days. Many school students already have after school activities varying from sports to book clubs. If schools make students join a school bound activity then they might not be able to do a out of school activity that they are enjoying now. Students might not be able to find a extracurricular activity that they enjoy at school but out of school there are a ton of more options.

Another reason I do not agree that every student should have to participate in a after school extracurricular activity is because students already spend a decent amount of time in schools. Superintendent Generic_Name says ""most schools in our district have their students in school for around six to seven hours a day."" Adding more time for mandatory after school activities would leave less time to work on their homework or study for tests. Making extracurricular activities mandatory will likely resolve in arguments between the school and parents. The parents might argue about how these activities get in the way of their schedule and they won't want to try to work around it.

A third reason I do not agree that every student should have to participate in a after school extracurricular activity is because it can interfere with students and adults schedules. Generic_School, who has made extracurricular activities mandatory, explains that many of their students parents have complained that they want them to stop making extracurricular activities mandatory because they can't find the time to pick up their child. Generic_School is a great example of why we shouldn't make extracurricular activities mandatory. Many parents have to take time out of their jobs to pick up their child but mandatory after school activities will most likely have them confused and on the clock.

Many people would argue that extracurricular activities are a great way to make new friends and have fun. I agree that is what after school activities are suppose to be like but some people don't like the idea of staying at school any longer then they already do. Another thing is that what if you choose a activity but it is already full so you are auto assigned to a activity you don't like. Some people might just quit the activity and find one they like outside of school, but you have to stay in your assigned group because it is mandatory.

I do not agree that every student should have to participate in a after school extracurricular activity. My reasons are because some students already have a out of school activity that they enjoy, students already spend enough time in school, and it can interfere with students and parents schedules. If you enjoy a school activity then you should keep doing it but if you are not into school activities you don't have to do them.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
DB9838545463,"A boy's mother is suffering from cancer, so he must return home every day after school and care for her, assuring her that he has arrived back safely and is readily at her side. Cancer is a violent, devastating disease that deteriorates its planned target and spreads throughout the body at a rapid pace. This is an example of a student who has too many preexisting obligations, and a family crisis taking place that can't be ignored. This student may be unable to participate in extracurricular activities. It is common for a child to engage in sports and other social activities, but demanding such a thing is unnecessary and could overload them. When a student is mandated to take extra time to do something, their grades could plummet, they could gain anxiety or depression, and they could lose vital sleep.

When someone who regularly attends school goes through traumatic experiences, their grades go down the drain. They lose focus or simply give up. In their endeavor to help those in need and help themselves, they begin to view school as useless, or not deserving of their attention. Forcing students who are already under a great deal of stress to take part in more things can be their breaking point, rather than nourishment. The person could be brought to a new low: looking to drugs or alcohol as an alternative to stress. They will become dependent on such things and lose themselves. They will veer away from valuable paths that were leading towards a diploma or an advanced diploma. Studying will be hard to fit in, and the student will stop caring about their grades in the vast sea of depression. They will inevitably fail to understand the importance of educational rewards.

Depression and anxiety are similar, but not the same. They can, however, occur simultaneously and for the same reason. Anxiety is the constant fear of what awaits. Sometimes it's random and without reason, sometimes it's a debilitating disorder, and sometimes it's because the person is genuinely afraid. Depression happens to a person with a slower onset: it waits in their mind and causes them to doubt. Sometimes depression causes suicide, a very sad, final act which can't be reversed. Depression and anxiety are both very damaging to the mental health of a person, and can be caused by an inability to grasp the bright side of life. These things can happen when students are overloaded, and they can get worse over time. If someone is told they are required to do something when they can't find it within the realm of their capabilities, they become hopeless. They doubt whether they can hold their own against the mountain of depression, family problems, school, homework, extracurricular activities, and everything else that keeps piling up. Some students just can't handle the extra work, or they can't handle getting to the destination. Some students have to walk home, and they physically can't get to where they need to go for an extracurricular activity. Trying to can result in exhaustion, just as depression and anxiety can.

With all of these things the child is trying to participate in, they can lose sleep. The anxiety can keep them up at night, praying that they can complete the requirements of school. They could be praying that their mother gets through a terrible disease, or that their father comes home. They could be praying that their brother or sister succeeds in getting off drugs, and that their friend doesn't hurt them self. A thousand thoughts could be whirling through this poor person's mind, preventing them from getting to sleep. Consequently, if this person is driving, they could get into a car accident, hurting themselves along with other people. This is yet another reason why extracurricular activities can't be demanded.

These are terrible circumstances: plummeting grades, depression, anxiety, and loss of sleep. Any of these terrible circumstances could be caused or worsened because of a demand for extracurricular activities. Although the benefits of social activities may be significant, they simply can not be demanded.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
DFB05A5E4FE7,"Well There is a lot to do in school, but some kids don't have time to do in school and outside activity , some Kids might do it because they like doing things and being active , and some other Kids might have bad grades and want to stay on them . perosonly I would do it to keep me happy and doing things then staying in the house and watching my phone or watching TV.

A6B20075B2A5,"Imagine you're drowning, then someone gives you a baby to take care of, it's name is ""soccer practice"". Some students already have other things to do, they don't need to balance more in their day. A forced school activity is sometimes too much for students who already are not doing so well in school and at home. Why I feel we don't need a mandatory extracurricular activity is for students that take care of siblings, too much homework, and it's stressful.

Taking care of a sibling is hard enough, to put a sports practice on top of that is harder. I take care of my younger brother at home, he is in 6th grade but I still make him do his homework before I can do mine. Adding another activity to my after school day would mean that my brother probably won't do his work until I get home. A mandatory activity would mean me suffering, not sleeping enough because of my brother, then being tired at school, then not doing well at practice and going home to just sleep ignoring my brother, he would be most affected because of this.

Homework is another thing entirely different thing. I mentioned my brother not doing his homework until I get home, but I can't do my homework until he is done. I have to then do my homework later and later, forcing my to sleep less and less, which is definently not good for you. activities push back what is already pushed back. It is also not that fun to do homework at 11 pm.

Stress is something very relevant, most teens experience some degree of stress sometime in school, whether in a project or a speech. while trying to balance school and home life, the added stress of doing well in that sport, club or band can tip students over the ""edge"". I experience a lot of stress about school, one more thing to worry about might make me go bald at 40.

In reality this plan of a mandatory activity is just too much for me and for my peers. You can think whatever you want about this topic but feel there is no way that plan would have positive feedback. It seems to me like it only causes problems. Now, all I ask is for you to take this into account when talking about this subject.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
7D0190DF4E7D,"After months of protest against it the voting was sure to happen, and we all knew that it was sure to happen. We would have to pick a extracurricular activity in order to finish the school year. Here are some reasons why this is a bad thing, and some ways to make it a little better.

First, students need to have choices for what they want to do in high school. We need more freedom as we become an adult. When the people who are barely passing their main classes add another thing to do, they can just lose it and fail everything. When this goes in to affect some students will drop out because of all the stress.

Next, the principal can't just force people to do what you want them to do. At the beginning of the year the principal said that ""Things might get tough at times but at North Generic_School we won't force you to do subjects."" The principal went back on his word when he is forcing students to take extracurricular classes. You can't force people to do something (after saying you wouldn't) and not expect resistance.

Also, here are someways to make this better. We should be able to choose to or not take extracurricular activities. I know I have said this the entire document but just change it. Next, students should be able to vote or come up with extracurricular activities the school could mold into an club or class. Also, students could have the choice on what days they would have the elective.

Finally, I think that students shouldn't be forced to do things they don't have to do. I think that to make this better the principal should rethink this entire ordeal. We need to make Generic_School a good school again and beat Generic_School. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
D9B3809280F9,"Why It Should be Required for Students to Partake in an Extracurricular Activity

Should students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity?

Yes, they should.

Doing activities that aren't required have many benefits. Just some of those benefits are good for the brain, represent your school in different ways than just your grades, and get to know some teachers better than you already did.

It's also just fun.

Many studies have shown that sports or other activities can help the brain or mind in many ways.

It can help by distracting it from stress.

Another way it could help is by developing parts of the brain or educating it in a different way than ""normal"".

For example, if the extracurricular activity you participated in was playing an instrument, that has been proven to educate the brain in different places and that person could be very intelligent.

Next, you can represent your school in other ways then just your grades.

For example, if your sports team wins a championship game you and your other teammates could be in the newspaper or on television wearing the schools jerseys.

If you get clothes with the activity you participate in and schools name on it, that is another way to represent.

When people see your team or group they might tell people how good you were.

When schools are represented in a good way you may get rewarded for it.

Lastly, you could get to know teachers better.

Most of the coaches are also teachers.

When students are in class teachers teach you about a certain subject, but when your at a sports practice or instrumental rehearsal you get to know them in a different way.

You both have something you are excited about doing in common.

Students dont necessarily ""love"" to learn, so they aren't as energetic during school as they would be during something they enjoy.

In conclusion, yes it's a great thing to participate in extracurricular activities.

It develops young people's brains, shows what your school is all about, and get closer with some teachers.

There are many, many more reasons but these are most relevant.

When deciding if it should be required or not please consider these important reasons.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
4EE5BF805EB5,"A old man told me once "" the future dose not come to you. you go to the future"". I agree with the principal making every student do one extracurricular activity. The principal making every one do extracurricular activities is a good idea. Its a new way to make friends and have fun, and it can help find what you might want to do in your future.

Making everyone do a extracurricular activity is beneficial for the students and the school. These extracurricular activities will help people be able to make new friends because they will share a common interest .When I grew up in Generic_City from first to third grade. I did a lot of extracurricular activities .one of them were soccer. I met a couple of kids that also liked soccer too. So me and my friends would stay after school to play soccer everyday.

extra curicular activites would help us find our passion for what we want do in the future. extra curiculat activitys might help student what they want to do in their future at a very young age. people who are in journalism club might want to be a journalist in the futrure. people who loved scince club and all the cool experiments might want to become a scientist when they grew up.

When the old man first told ""future dose not come to you. you go to the future."" I was confused. every second that passes by I go a little bit into the future but now I get it.

C6D0943E61A7,"Growing up as a person is not just about the things you learn in school. It is also about having fun and learning who you are. I believe that extracurricular activities are the best way to learn how to do these things. With extracurricular activities, you will enjoy your middle school life much more. They will create less stress, give you oppurtunities to meet new people, and will make you a better person.

It's hard to find people that you like in middle school. If you find a club, sport, or activity that you enjoy outside of school, you will meet other people that share that same interest. You will likely form bonds with these people and become friends. Having people that you can talk to and trust is very important, especially when you are in middle school. Being in a club or on a team teaches you to cooperate with others and be more social and outgoing.

It is a well known fact that school causes a lot of stress in adolescents. After school, going to your extracurricular activity can get your mind off of all the stress that goes on in school or while doing homework. Playing a sport actually releases chemicals in your brain that make you happier. Doing an activity can also make you better at time management. If you are participating in an ativity after school, you must have the responsibility to do your homework as soon as you get home and not get distracted. This will prepare you for when you're in high school and there is block scheduling. You can't procrastinate or you will never catch up.

Extracurricular activities teach you a lot, no matter what the activity is. Whether you are learning a new skill, or helping the environment, you are becoming a better person. Many schools offer activities or clubs that can get you involved in your school's community. You can volunteer at a local animal shelter, or learn an instrument and make beautiful music. Whatever you do, finding something that you are passionate about will have a positive effect on your life.

Although many middle schoolers enjoy sitting at home all afternoon, eating and watching television, they should experience different activities. You don't know if you are good at something or if you enjoy it if you haven't tried it. If you go out and try new things, you will see that there is a whole world outside of school and home, just waiting to be explored.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Students can become friends with other people. Some people don't have friends and they wanna make friends. Some students have friends and their friends are doing a different activity. Some students don't wanna feel left out so they make friends.

FC4FBC43EF32,"Should all kids participate in a extracurricular activities? I think kids shouldnÃÂ´t be forced to play in sports, or join a club. They should have a choice to join anything or not. After school kids have may have work to do at home. They should go home and bond with their families. Kids should have the choice to join school activities or sports.

First, kids after school have more important things. Some have to take care of younger siblings, or family members every day. Some teenagers have jobs to support college funds or to help their family. To the students that work sports and clubs arenÃÂ´t very important and they need the job more. Schools should think about those students before enforcing this.

Second, five days a week for almost an entire year kids go to school for about eight hours a day. After school kids have homework, chores, and a social life to keep up with. Making them join extracurricular activities puts more on the student. They should be able to hang out with friends and family. Schools should try to be more helpful instead of putting more stress on their students.

Lastly, some cases activities can be good for children. Sports can help kids with depression or kids with a lack of friends. Sports can also get some students a scholarship to a college that they canÃÂ´t afford to go to. Clubs can help them what they are passionate about and want to work into further. Some extracurricular activities can help kids get healthier. Extracurricular activities can be helpful sometimes, depending on the student.

In conclusion, Sports and clubs shouldnÃÂ´t be forced onto students. The activities should be recommended and given time to think about. For some students, sports will benefit them but, for others it can give them stress. I understand the reason for the schoolÃÂ´s idea but I still believe they shouldÃÂ´t apply the rule to the school.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A35176B2A7B0,"Have you ever stayed up so late trying to complete all of your homework? Have you ever stayed up trying to complete projects all due one day? Now, imagine your principle is forcing you to do another activity, causing you to lose more and more time and sleep. This can affect many student's conflicts, interests, and other issues such as homework and their grades. Why jam another thing into student's lives if they're already packed enough?

Many students already have many things going on in their lives. Appointments, club sports, family, where are they expected to fit another chunk of time? If the principle is forcing students to attend an extracurricular activity, it must be during school hours or else it will conflict with many possibly already scheduled events. However, if the principle decides to make the activities not apart of the school day, students would either be going to bed even later, or waking up even earlier. Sleep is a very important factor of your health, and it would not be fair at all to take it away from students. Some families go on an annual week-long trip. Although, you will always be missing a bunch of school, you will also be missing out on you activity, and that can stress someone out very easily.

Another issue with forced extracurricular activities, is there may not be an interesting activity for everyone. That it totally not fair to force a student to do something that they may not want to do. There is no issue in encouraging students to participate in extracurricular activities, but if they don't find one that interests them, they shouldn't have to do it. If a student does not think they are good enough or do not want to participate, being forced can cause stress in their life. Stress is a serious issue that can lead to anxiety, depression, or possibly even suicide. That may sound extreme, but it does happen, and is not safe for any student to suffer from.

With all of the other issues listed previously, there still come more. Parents have to work to support their families. Whether they work from home, work at an office, or anywhere else, they aren't available all day, every day, to pick up/drop off their children. Knowing all the students that get picked up and dropped off from school in the car pickup line, this can become a school wide issue, regarding many of the student's parents. If they can't get there in time, then their students are left at school. When the students finally get home, they will most likely have a bunch of homework, a project, or studying they need to get done. Students stay up way too late doing their homework in the first place, imagine adding an hour to two hours later than that. If a student can not finish a project or their homework, their grades will plummet.

A required extracurricular activity can be detrimental to a student's life and mental health. This can impact their conflicts, interests, and other issues in their lives such as homework and grades. It would be so unfair to impose these activities into their already jam-packed lives.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

I felt my whole body burst with joy, hearing the crowd and my team mates scream with excitement was a feeling I will never forget. It is a feeling I hope everyone can feel one day. Playing sports really boosted my self-esteem, with unforgettable memories. I believe everyone should participate in some sort of extracurricular activity in school. That could be playing a sport, being in a club, helping in yearbook, even being a student council, and many other activities students can do.

First, I think students should participate in extracurricular activities because it helps students interact with other students and even adults. Interacting with other students in school will be very helpful in life. Students need to learn to get along with others and respect one another. Most jobs are required for you to interact with other people. Not everyone likes to interact with others, but when participating in any extracurricular activity it gives you the chance to practice this and work on getting better for later on in life.

Next, when students do extracurricular activities they are less likely to be lazy. If they are doing a sport, club, or participating in any other activities they will be active in that activity. When doing extracurricular activities students will always be working hard in whatever they may be doing. Teaching students to work hard in life and school leads to success. The students doing these extracurricular activities will most likely to have more success than the ones who don't do any sports or activities, and are lazy and don't care about doing anything at all. Working hard in life can also help students self esteem. When you work hard you will probably be proud and accomplished for yourself. That could make a big impact on students lives.

Lastly, almost everyone has a dream college they would love to get in to. Colleges look at the students grades, but they also look at the extracurricular activities the student has done. When students do extracurricular activities it helps them. The more extracurricular activities you do, the better it is for applicating for a college and better for later in life. Some people don't always believe this is true, but it is proved that the more extracurricular activities you do the better the student will do.

Therefore, if everyone did extracurricular activities, then they would be much more successful. So the next time you see a sign-up sheet for a sport you think you would like. Sign-up for that sport. Or even when the class votes for the student president, try being the class president. Go for it and think about all the reasons it could help you. It could help you more than you think. Extracurricular activities will lead to your success.          ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
22DB84B437CC,"What do think of extracurricular activities? Usually they are programs or activities outside of work or school. In this case it's school and, not all students like doing them because they don't like to interact with others or they don't have an interest for it. Some schools require extracurricular activities and I agree because it's a chance to have new hobbies and friends.

To start, by doing extracurricular activities you can discover new hobbies. Some students are required to do extracurricular activities and have found a new hobby or interest doing so. I believe it is a good thing because by having new hobbies they can also discover new career paths to go along with it. Therefore, when a student decides to get a job or when they graduate they might have some experience in that area due to the extracurricular activities. Students could also use these hobbies in their everyday life or even boost their confidence in something like SCA. However, some of these extracurricular activities are not all hobbies but, long-term thing like sports. Sports can be a good way to boost confidence and how social a student is in public, at home, and school.

Lastly, doing activities outside of school is also a great way to make friends. Activities such as sports, SCA, or any hobbies can be a good way to spark new friendships. These friends could be long or short-term but, by having friends can produce more interacting with others and more participation in extracurricular activities. The only downside is, horsing around or being engaged in conversation while participating in activities. However, students who are not very social with others could make friends an have someone to support them when they need it. This could also benefit others participating because they could engage in conversation, depending on the activities, and have the opinion of that students.

Overall, by doing activities outside of school students could discover new hobbies and make new friends. Extracurricular activities are not only good for what they are meant to be but, for boosting parts of a persons personality that might be low. So, next time think of an extracurricular activity as a good way to start something new.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

It's not that schools don't have after school it's that students just don't care or they don't know what's out there. In all my years of going to school I have all ways participated in after school activities, and every single one of them has helped me in some way, and that's why I think that students should participate in them. Students should be required to participate in sports, working on year book, or serving on student council because it helps them maintain grades, gives students a chance to interact with other students, and they have a chance to give back to their school.

Students that play sports have to maintain their grades when they'er off the field in order to play on the field. This helps them to have a ""C"" or higher and they can apply what they learn on the field to when they'er off the field. A student in my class is always asking for his absent work because he has to leave early for one of his games. This student doesn't play just one sport but 3. So when he comes back the next day he has to make up all of his work if he wants to stay on the team. An example of applying what student learn on the field to off the field is my friend that plays football. He said to me ""I could never make a touch down if some one wasn't covering my blind side"",then he said, ""It's not about if

I win because

I would have never maid it if there was no one on the team to cover me."" Then the next day at his game he maid sure that the crowds were celebrating him and the team when they won.

Year book gives students a chance to interact with other students by giving new students a chance to make friends, and it helps them find other students they can relate to. In the 6th grade I was going to a new school, that I new nothing about and then club sign ups came, and I decided to sign up for year book. when I started out they gave me a camera and told me what kind of pictures they were looking for. When I went around the school and asked students if I could take their picture they were nice about it and said sure. Out of the 25 people I asked to take their picture 17 of them asked me if I wanted to be friends, and I said yes. Also the people in the year book club were new to the school just like me we talked about how we came to a new school and none of are friends came with us. Year book helped me find friends and find people who understood what I was going trough.

Student council is a good way to give back to your school, by showing that they appreciate your school and to show school spirit. Students on student council show that they appreciate their school when they represent them. For example when student council does a sock drive and then goes and distributes the socks to the less fortunate, they are showing how their school feels, and that they want to give back to the community we live in. When the students on student council show school spirit they go to the school sports games, show up for fund raisers, and set an example for how other students should act in school. By showing this appreciation and spirit they set the bar higher for other schools and show that they support our's.

Students should participate in sports, working on year book, or serving on student council because they will have good grades, a chance to interact with other students, and a way to give back to the community. Students will build character buy interacting with other students and have fun while doing it. Ding, ding, ding, thats the sound of the bell for after school. All the students flood into the hallways talking to each other about sports, year book, and student council. No student fells left out and every student has a friend.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
4739D03E52FB,"I remember being in the yearbook club in 7th grade and enjoying the experience, well this doesnt carry for everyone. Forcing kids into extracurricular activities wouldn't be fair, people can be busy after school, parents can't pick them up, and they just not find interest in these activities or be in ones outside of the school.

Firstly, every kid at one point has had chores or are still doing chores and from experience their time consuming which could easily lead to a kid being to busy for a club or sport, kids could also have part time jobs like babysitting or mowing the neighbors lawn, and they could have a job that requires them after school. Chores are vital to keep a house running in most cases. Things like doing the dishes so dishes don't build is a major one for a nicer and cleaner house, and maybe its the kids job to do them after school. Another issue with this is the fact that some kids babysit and other small jobs this means they have things to do at certain times and places. Some kids in middle school and high school have jobs and can't stay after due to schedule.

Secondly, most parents have jobs and with those jobs comes times where maybe they cant pick up their kid, this means that the kid would be stuck at the school waiting or have to go alone which based on where you are could be unsafe. Family members like a grandma or grandpa could be busy or not able to drive which could make them unavailable to pick kids up after school. Kids couldn't get home on their own, walking could be an option but some parents don't want their kids walking due to safety issues or concerns.

Lastly, there are some clubs and sports that the school doesn't host that kids could go to, like another team outside of the school teams or the clubs might be a out of town or start right after school. Sports are hosted outside of schools like some teams for soccer or basket ball, so the kid could already be on a preexisting team and this probably wouldn't count to the required amount. Finally, some kids could dislike or not find interest in the activities available leaving them either forced into a sport or forcing themselves into a sport they don't like.

In conclusion, the idea of required extracurricular activities sounds pointless, kids could be busy with work, might not be able to work with their parents schedule, and they could be involved with something else outside of school and might not like the selection given. the idea of a extracurricular activity being required sounds like it could mess with peoples out of school jobs and or things, plus parents would have to be involved and most can't all the time.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
6.60E+11,"Imagine you are sitting down in the cafeteria alone because you have no one to talk to, and then you hear about an interesting extracurricular activity so you sign up. That is how most students find something that they really like to do. Extracurricular activities are a way for students to explore there talents and find what they are good at and what they can improve. I believe all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they have something to look forward to, get to make new friends, and get to try something new.

One reason reason students should do an after school activity is because it gives them something to look forward to. Most students agree that school is boring because they learn about stuff that they don't find useful. some students even drop out of school because of those reasons. However, with extracurricular activities you get to do what you want to do after the school day. Instead of people dropping out of school so they can start a music career, they can join a music club after school. Then they can work on both their academic work and perfecting their music talent without dropping out

Another reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they can make friends. Most friends people make at school are through extracurricular activities because everyone there has similar interests. At the beginning of my first year of middle school I auditioned for the middle school musical

Rock of Ages . I didn't have many friends at the beginning of the year, but I made a lot of friends through the musical who I am still friends with now.

One reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they get to try something new. School should be about learning what this is you can do well naturally and what you might need improvement on, and this is exactly what extracurricular activities do. There are different types of activities for different types of students. You cans sign up for the school play, a sport that you like, a club that helps the environment, and countless others. If students didn't sign for an extracurricular activities they wouldn't be able to experience everything that their class mates did and they might regret their decision later.

Extracurricular activities are something every student should do because it lets them try something new, helps them make friends, and it gives them something to look forward to. Some people don't think every student should be forced to do extracurricular activities because it takes time away from students being able to spend time with family or do homework, and they are right. However, even though they will have less time to spend with their family and on homework the students will still be happy because they got to do an extracurricular activity. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
274FC279EC5D,"Do you play a sport outside of school? Outside of school, most students have made a serious commitment to activities that they have an interest in.

I don't think students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity in school because it takes time away from playing sports, reduces the socialization of students, and makes school seem boring.

Firstly, participating in an extracurricular activity in school creates less time for a student to play a sport on a travel team. Some students are very dedicated to a sport on a travel team. Missing practice could negatively affect a student's performance in a game. In addition, coaches could think a player is slacking off if a player continuously misses practices. They may also believe that the player isn't interested in the sport, so they could kick him off the team.

After-school activities also reduce the socialization of students. If a student is staying at school until five o'clock for an extracurricular activity, he doesn't have any time to go to his friend's house because he needs to do his homework when he arrives at his house. A student also won't be able to socialize because it will be able too dark by the time he gets home and settles in. In most cases, a person is famished when he comes home from a long day at school. After eating a snack, the sky will be pitch black. A student won't have any time to meet his friend.

Requiring students to take part in a extracurricular activity makes school seem like a boring chore. To begin, students already have to be at school for seven hours. Adding two hours to the day isn't a thrill to any student because it means students have to be at school for a longer time. In addition, if students don't have an interest in any of the school activities, they shouldn't be forced to choose one. They will dread coming to school because they will be forced to be part of an activity that is tedious for them.

In conclusion, students shouldn't be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because it takes time away from playing sports, makes it harder to socialize, and makes school seem boring. After-school activities don't provide anything that students aren't already being exposed to, making them unnecessary. Would you rather be part of an extracurricular activity, or go to basketball practice?",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
E6A0EF9688EE,"I agree, students should participate in after school activities because it's a way to express yourself and to get know other people, there is a big chance that you could make many friends as well. First, I believe that if you participate in an after school activity it will make your mental health and physical health better. For example, football is a very active sport, you can get a lot of exercise out of playing the game, doing drills or even just going over the plays, It tests you in a physical and mental way. What if thats just not your thing, you could go for robotics, it will challenge how well you are with your hands by putting intricate things together or even coding the robots or the project your working on. Maybe you just want a relaxing activity, there is a program called base, it helps students study by providing a nice, quit, and relaxing environment, you are allowed to talk to other people around you but the volume must stay low. Secondly, instead of all the activities, you are also allowed to stay after school with your teachers, make up some work, retake a quiz/test, or do some community service for them, there is a place for everyone at after school. Lastly, after school is open to anyone who wants to come, we will gladly welcome you with open arms, if you have any questions about where to go or even what teachers stay after school, you can ask the front desk, or your teachers for more information. The news will have announcements about after school if it will be an all academic day or if after school is canceled it will probably be announced on the news. I feel like everyone should go to after school so everyone can have the same oportonitys to ask teachers if they need help or what they need to do in class to catch up, or even show the gym teachers how good you are at sports, but always remember that after school should always be a safe and fun environment, and make it as enjoyable for other people as it is for you.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
DC73C0D559C2,"Extracurricular activities help distract students from doing terrible things. What if some students have to go to church after school? Or what if some students have other chores to accomplish after school. If we give each and every student at least 1 extracurricular activity, then all of those students who have something else to do apart from extracurricular activities would have to change their schedule due to the fact that they will not be able to complete their objectives after school. This represents my position of disagreeing the idea of giving students at least 1 extracurricular activities.

Primarily, students have the choice to participate in extracurricular activities, if they choose to not participate in extracurricular activities then that would mean that they have other personal activities or objectives after school. I chose to rarely participate in any extracurricular activities due to the fact that I have a lot of chores to accomplish at home after school and having 1 or more extracurricular activities may impact my daily schedule and I would have to accomplish my chores at a later time than usual. If students do chose to participate in extracurricular activities then that would mean that they have already planned their schedule for their days.

The second reason is that if some students have their days planned and their schedule ready for the day, but if we give those students 1 or more extracurricular activities, then they would have to rearrange their schedule and replan their days again to squeeze in the extracurricular activities into their schedule. And if some students rearrange their schedule then that means that they would have to do their personal activities later than usual. If school ends at 2:15 and I have to go to church at 3:00, I would finish church at around 6:00 and have 3 more hours to do my home work and do my chores around the house. But if I add 1 1/2 more hours for soccer practice then I would leave school at 2:15, go to soccer practice at 3:00 and finish at 4:30, go to church for 3 hours and then come home at around 7:30, I do my homework and do my chores for 2 hours and now its past 9:00 and I am still doing my chores.

In conclusion, students that must choose an extracurricular activity mustve already have a choice of what they would like to do and already must have a planned schedule of their days. But their comes the risk of those 1 or more extracurricular activities will may impact their schedules for personal activities or objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
EC3D5F3383D0,"I completely disagree with our principal's decision. Students should never be forced to do activities, they sign up for them because they want to. Some students have responsibilities after school and dont have time to stay. Some students also dont have enough money so if the activities have a entrance fee or they go on field trips often then that would not be helping their families. The students would be more stressed and tired during the school day as well. I do not believe students should be forced to do extracurricular activities.

When clubs go on field trips they usually cost money. Some families barely have enough money to put food on the table and having to pay for field trips or club entrance fees won't help their situation. If the student can't afford to go on the field trip then they will have to stay at the school and that will make them feel left out. If the students are not forced to join a club then they won't have to pay for entrance fees or to go on field trips. They also won't feel as left out and alone at school.

When extracurricular activities are made mandatory it can put a lot of pressure and stress on students. Most kids have chores and homework to do when they get home from school. When you pile up homework, chores and clubs it can be extremely stressful and tiring. Students will fall asleep more often in class and their grades will plummet, which in turn will make them stress more and make things worse. without them having to do clubs students will have less to worry about.

Some students may also be excluded by the other club members. If a student has trouble understanding something that all the other club members understand they might be made fun and bullied. If students who are not interested in any of the clubs have to join one, then they may just pick one at random and sometimes they may be unqualified for the club they choose. Other members of the club who chose it and are qualified for it may believe they are better than the student who isn't prepared for it and may start bullying them. This can lead to the student becoming aggressive, angry, sad and even depressed.

In conclusion I believe our principal's decision is wrong to force extracurricular activities on students. It can have terrible side effects on their emotional state and mental health. It can also have bad effects on their families financial state. If the students get bad grades and fall asleep in class then the schools image will be tainted as well. It will not be seen as a good school but rather as a school that puts too much pressure and work on it's students.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
E82F173F9C67,"I agree with this statement because if students were to participate in sports, they would be more fit and active. I agree with this a lot because i used to not really do anything in gym but then i started running and I noticed how fast I run so I kept doing it and i go a little bit skinnier and a little bit faster.

Working on the yearbook is also something i'd agree with because it could either make the student feel good or wanted and that goes for any extracurricular activity. Im pretty sure that if you help working on the yearbook you probably get to edit some of it in your own way.

Serving on the student council is a good thing to do because you're serving them food and its also a great thing to do because it makes you feel happier and makes them feel blessed, thankful, and boost their moods. Im kinda used to this because i worked at a homeless shelter and i had to feed the homeless people and almost every single time i served them food they'd always feel so blessed and thankful to get the food.

I think another extracurricular activity is reading because your doing something you don't normally do. But I think students should read to get more knowledge and grow a bigger imagination because I remember i read diary of a wimpy kid books back when i was 11 and it made me feel more positive about myself, made me accept who i am, and especially made my imagination grow a lot.

These are all of my reasons why I agree with the principal with participating in at least one activity.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
127E7F587FBD,"Determined, I sprinted across the soccer field to get open for a pass. My teammate was pushing the ball towards the opposing team's goal and I wanted to ensure that we would score. I ran right past two or three defenders and called for the ball. He kicked me the perfect pass right through the middle of their defense. During those two seconds the ball soared over to me, all I could think about was scoring that goal. Once the ball reached me I chested the ball in order to control it, then fired a shot straight into the bottom right corner of the net! The score was now 2-1 with us in the lead, late in the second half. I smiled and silently thanked my parents for making me play this sport. Thanks to this experience, I have been driven to write an essay regarding extracurricular activities. Recently, our principal has decided to make extracurricular activities required. He states that every student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While not everybody is on board yet, yes, it is a good idea to require extracurricular activities in schools.

First of all, extracurricular activities are beneficial to most people. A survey given to schools across Generic_City that was made by the county's school board asked students about their extracurricular activities. Three questions in the survey particularly stand out. The first of the three was whether or not students enjoy their extracurricular activities. The second one was whether or not students learned something from them, and the last one was if students would recommend their activity to other students in the school. The answers to the first and second were both 92% yes, and the third one was 81% yes. Therefore showing that extracurricular activities can be an important and enjoyable part of your life. They bring new and fun learning points to your life rather than old and boring school based curriculum that you might not even use for the rest of your life. There is absolutely no reason why students shouldn't participate in an extracurricular activity

Furthermore, there is something for everyone. When I was in the 6th grade, way back in the day, I had a strange friend group. hardly anybody shared the same interests. I liked to run, and my buddy Generic_Name liked to sit back and watch TV, but we were somehow best buds!

When our school started introducing some after school activities, every single one of my friends was in a different activity. I was in the running club, Generic_Name was in movie analysis, Generic_Name was in Lego club, and Generic_Name was in board games. Not one person was disappointed with their activity. This proves that there are options for everybody. Every student will have something that interests them which leads to them enjoying the activity, and learning from it.

Most importantly, these extracurricular activities can lead to a career choice. In an interview with principal Generic_Name of Generic_School, Generic_Name states: ""Extracurricular activities are very important to me as a principal. We offer our students a wide variety of clubs such as writing club, sports analysis club, biology, chemistry, and history, hoping to spark interest in these students for their future career choices.""

This quote by Principal Generic_Name shows that extracurricular activities are not just used for fun and games. They are there to inspire students. To get them ready for their future.

If students don't learn what they want to do in life how will they ever be successful? That alone is important enough to make extracurricular activities required.

On the other hand, some people believe it shouldn't be required to do some sort of extracurricular activity because they would take up unnecessary time. A survey was given to parents of Generic_City Public School students, asking if they were unhappy about how much time their children take up doing their extracurricular activities. Out of 128 responses 53% said yes, they are unhappy with the amount of time their child is taking doing his or her extracurricular activities. Sure, this is a good point. However, the activities are not meant for the parents. They are meant for the students. Going back to the first survey mentioned; the one given to Generic_City students; out of 2243 responses, 96% of students say their activities are worth while. Almost every single student thought their activities were worth their time. If students believe their activities don't take up too much time, why not require them? If their parents are unhappy that should not change anything because these activities are meant to benefit students, not their parents.

All in all, we need our extracurricular activities, and to make them required is a great idea. It is fun for the students, It's beneficial, it's a good learning experience, and it's a good way to give students ideas for their career. If you want to help make schools require extracurricular activities, you can send an email to your principal asking to require them. If you want to help out in different ways, go ahead and form a club for your school! It could be anything that interests you, or anything you want to inform others on. It's up to you. Before we depart, I want to ask you; Without extracurricular activities, where would we be now?",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
FBDAEF796D29,"Don't you think that some students wont find the activities interesting? what if the students dont have time for an activity and participation due to the work load from school? Dont you think students would get injuries from the sports provided? In general, most people stress enough with other things out of school. So I think students should not be required to participate. Because not all students have time for an activity due to tight schedule, some students will not be able to balance a extracurricular activity with school work, and the activities that are available like sports can cause injuries.

Most students already have tight schedules, and take advanced classes that challenge them already. Home work and projects stress students causing them to take a lot of time and effort to raise there grades. What I am saying is, the work load from school already keep students busy. Not everyone will have time to practice for a sport competition, or have the time to plan school events as student council.

Time after school is valuable to students. How? students like to enjoy there hobbies like drawing, playing games, hanging out with there friends etc. Replacing that time with extracurricular activities would only stress the students more causing them to tire themselves. Family time is important to students too, but that time is limited because school takes mostly take half of the time in a day. About an average time of 7 hours school takes up in one day, so say like a student wakes up at 7:00 AM and school starts at 8:30 AM. School would end at 3:25 PM and the remaining time would be left would be about 6 hours for a student to do chores, finish homework, eat dinner and lunch with the following of other responsibilities.

Doing an activity would mean balancing time and responsibilities at home with homework too. For some students it wouldn't be a problem but for others it might be. Not everyone is capable at managing time so as multitasking. Everyone is different but everyone has there own time and schedule knowing fitting in other activities is hard to do. Example, say like you do a sport which would be like volleyball and you sprained your wrist on your dominate hand. Your dominant hand is used for writing in school. That would mean you will have to take more time completing other assignment's due to the injury. Injuries will interfere with your everyday life because of the time the injury takes to heal. It can also permanently affect your health which causes your time management to shift permanently too.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities impact students lives more then you think. Not everyone has enough time or have the ability to balance an extra activity and responsibilities out of school. In the end its mostly the students choice to join an activity or not. Cause you don't know everyone life out of school or the hardships that they are going through that are preventing them to participate.    ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
763585B6169F,"Imagine you are a student and your principal is forcing all students to participate in at least 1 after school activity and, you do not know if you should participate or not. In my opinion, I agree with the principal that all students should participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity due to the amount of fun, making friends, and less free time.

Extracurricular activity can be so much fun and exciting, even if its a sport, helping with yearbook or even serving on the school council. But, remember not all activities are fun to you. What makes a extracurricular activity fun is that it makes that person happy of what he or she is doing. For example, In middle school my friend and I both tryout for our school Football team and Basketball team. After we tryout, My friend decided to do football than basketball because she like throwing and catching the ball unlike myself I prefer basketball over football because I like shooting and having supportive teammates. This example shows that extracurricular activities can be fun when you find the one that most interest you.

Another reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is the people they are going to meet.

When playing a sport or joining a club students are going to meet all different kinds of girls and boys that they probably never seen or talked to in their entire life. Doing these after school activities helps the students bond with other kids or even help them become friends. For example, there is a girl she new to your school and she does not really have friends but, she likes to draw. So, she sign up for the art club and see bunch of kids from her class that also sign up for art. At first, she was nervous then she and the other students started talking and were getting along well. This example explains that joining a club or sport team can bring you closer to new people.

Even though extracurricular activities can be fun and bring people closer it can also take up a bunch of free time.

Some students will just wake up, go to school, do homework, sleep, and repeat every single day. Doing after school activities such as basketball, soccer, yearbook, art and etc. Can keep students busy from around 1 hour or 2. For example, when I was in 6th grade I did not do any extracurricular activities but, when I tryout for basketball and made it. It kept myself pretty busy all afternoon everyday. Now, I wish I had so free time for myself. But, all the example was explaining that doing clubs and sports kept students busy.

To mostly sum up everything, students should a least give it a try to participate in their schools extracurricular activities to see if they will have fun or even meet new people. That's why I believe students should participate due to amount of fun, making friends, and less free time.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
70ED78541A7E,"I agree with having extracurricular activities, they can also help you so much as life grows. Extracurricular activities can help you get more knowledge about what you are doing, it will help you in the long run with collage, and it can help people get something off their mind.

First of all, if you play sports you can learn any knowledge from hearing or even watching he T.V. screen. There was this one time when I was getting ready to get on a horse and my horse trainer said ""make sure you always tighten up your girth before you get on the horse."" Then she showed me the reason why she would always tighten her girth before she got on.

Second, extracurricular activities always help you in the long run if you want to go into collage. The people who except you in are the people who have checked your grades, sols, and even check your sport status to see if you got any scholarships. They want to make sure that you did not get in trouble a lot. Because if you did you will not go into collage.

Lastly, you can always help people who try extracurricular activities if they want to get their mind off something if they have a hard life or just want to do something fun. Sometimes when I am sad I like to see my friends and they always cheer me up.

I think doing extracurricular activities is a 100% recomended if anyone wants to try it. Extracurricular activities can help you get more knowledge about what you are doing, it will help you in the long run with collage, and it can help people get something off their mind. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
DAF474E5E711,"If our principle made everyone in our school do some sort of extracurricular activity, I would be on board. Kids should be more active. Some kids don't do anything but play video games. Our school has a wide variety of activities from sports to Musical Arts to clubs. So if after school activities were required, kids could get more exercise or spend time outside, they could make new friends and find new interests or hobbies.

Lots of kids don't get their daily dose of exercise like they should. Doing a sport or certain clubs could help them get that daily exercise that they need, and our school has lots of different options to choose from. You could do Football, Baseball, Tennis, Basketball, Wrestling, Track, Archery and more. And those are just the ones that are provided from our school. There are lots of other sports outside of school that you could do including swimming, martial arts, golf and much more. But sports is not the only thing that is available.

If some kids don't like sports, thats OK. They could try playing an instrument or singing. At our school, we have an amazing Musical Arts program. We have Band, Strings, and Chorus. You could choose from one of those, or you could try two. In both Strings and Band there is a wide variety of instruments to play from trumpet or tuba to violin or bass. If you join Band or Chorus, you also have a choice between doing Jazz Band for Band students, or Show Choir for Chorus students. All of these classes teach students how to read and then play or sing music. But if music is not for you, then there is still more to choose from.

Dont like sports? Not interested in music? Well then maybe you could try a club. We have a large selection of clubs that you could do, like yearbook club, Lego club, chess and checkers club, debate club, and lots more. Some clubs require you to be enrolled in a certain class, like Jazz Band. some clubs are after school clubs, like weight lifting club and archery. And some clubs even depend on you grades like junior beta club. There are lots of choices and even if none of the clubs sound interesting, try one! You might like it and it might spark a new interest.

So if the principle made us do an activity, then it would be a good thing. Kids will interact more, they will get more involved in the school, and they can stay healthy. And with the large variety of things to do, why not get involved?",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
17E0D40B3CB8,"Dear principal Generic_Name, I know you want EVERY student to do clubs, but I have some advice for you. So, every student has their own talent but some students either don't have talents or want to show to other people. But what if a student has a family emergency or something like that. I know that some students want to do it and some that don't want to. One reason that students don't want to do it is because they don't want to stay in school longer, we go to school 7 hours a day, 5 days a week, but we want to relax at home, thats want we look forward to, going home after 7 hours of not doing the thing we love. I understand that students like school and want to present their talents after the 7 hours. But, it is not fair to choose fot the sudents. So, in my conclusion don't make EVERY student do it, let them choose what they want to do. ",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
C762A53BA0E5,"In 6th grade my parents forced me to sign up for student council. At first, I was upset and I was trying to convince them to change their mind. They didn't. The next week I had my first meeting and I loved it. My first meeting was the highlight of my week. I wish there were meetings every day, but sadly there werent'. The only reason I got involved in student council was because my principal made the decision to offer student council and many other extracurricular activities. Students should participate in at least 1 school activity.

One reason students should participate in school activities is so that they can make new friends. Dr. James Arnold once stated that ""friends are like oxygen the more friends the better and you need friends to live just like you need oxygen to live."" This shows that it is impossible to have to many friends. There is no negative effects to having too may friends. Participating in school activities is a great way to make new friends. Dr. John Washington said that ""I once signed up for my school yearbook because I liked taking pictures, but I was a little worried because I didn't know anyone in the club. So I tried to make new friends. I met this kid named Alex and we became best friends till this day.""

It is clear to say that joining school activities is a great way to make new friends.

Secondly, it is true that going a school activity can also help the community. A serve taken by John Hopkins University shows that an average of 4 trees are planted every year by each U.S. school. With all the global warning going around the world it is clear that every tree being planted by U.S. schools will help the earth and that is all because of school activities. Some schools have a greens program that helps clean the earth. Normally the program meets once a week and they go and plant a tree, pickup trash around the community, help garden, and sometimes they volunteer to help the less fortunate. Students should be proud that they are helping the community in such great ways. The school should recognize the program and help to get more people to join the program. Programs like these are great for the community and environment and should be in every school in the county, but that's not my choice.

Lastly, students work really hard during school and deserve to do something fun and school activities is the perfect way to reward them. A report done by Oregon University shows that 89% of kids feel like they work better after 10 minutes of getting some fresh air. Students can be getting that fresh air by doing school activities. School activities combine learning and life skills together. By letting students go outside they are getting fresh air so that they aren't stuck in a school building the whole day..

Some people might think that doing these school activities is a waist of time and kids should just be learning the whole time. Although, they are particularly true it is also true that in order for kids to get a good job they need to be a respectful person and most jobs and colleges require community service hours. By joining these school activities they prepare you for the future. Tobias Johnson is the president of the company smart bond. He once stated that ""when I first started my company I only hired the people that have given back to the community and the people that seem like they have a kind hearts."" This means that these school activities will benefit them in the future. By joining these programs you can also put them on your regime and that shows that you have helped the community or helped your school by doing the right thing. Company and colleges will look at that and think this person is a leader. All good companies have leaders guiding the companies and employers to do the right thing. If a company didnt have any leaders to guide their company the company would fall apart and argue a lot. In the end picture it shows that most of the students that take school activities end up most successful in the future.

Ultimately, it is clear that doing school activities will benefit the students a lot through the use of making friends, helping the community, and getting the kids some sun while in school. By adding school activities to every school in the U.S. we can change the future of our society. If we dont start now by trying to change our students then companies will fail. If companies fail their will be no competition for buying goods and everything will be overpriced. We need to act now. If you want to help call or send a email to your principal and try to persuade him to add student activities to your school system. If you already have school activities then be active in joining them and try and convince your classmates to try and join them. This is our future.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
F651889F1A2D,"I strongly disagree with the idea that all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities after school. I disagree with this idea for 3 simple reasons. The first one being that some students may simply just not gave the time to the extracurricular activities. For example a student may currently be in a situation where they have a sick relative and they're the caretaker of the sick relative, for personal reasons. Therefore they have no extra time on their hands for this activities. My second reason is that some students may not have any interest in any of the activities the school has to offer. Now some people might say for the students to create something that hey would enjoy. Although that may sound like a good idea, there are some key things that you have to think about like budgeting and things like that.

Even though the principle thinks he/she is helping the students they're really just wasting their time. My third and final reason is some students may have failing grades. So all the extra time they might have during or after school they may want to spend that time dong makeup work to improve their grades.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
555B1B7D2167,"I disagree that we must participate in a school activity that we might not even enjoy doing because we don't have to do something that we are not good at or generally, what the principal wants us to do. In every school, there are so many activity that you can do, but do you really have to do them? No, i don't believe so. Every student should decide on what they want to do. Not all students want to do activities that others want them to do. We should be heard instead of the principal or staff making all of the decision that we may not agree on, like having to participate in school activities.

There are so many different activities that we can do. Not all needs to be decided by the principal. Students should find a hobby or a activity that they think they are good at. Things out of school. Not everyone is perfect at doing a specific type of activity or sport. Every is different, no one will ever be the same as one another. They should choose something that they want to do, not what someone else picks for them. Let them see what they are good at and decide.

Other parents may find this upsetting. Some parents want their kids to join a sport or do different activities but what if there isn't any time for them. Most of these activities are after school and not everyone has time to do them. Other students have important things to do and they just might be able to do any activity. Some parents don't want their kid stressed and if there is just many things for them to do. An after school activity or anything related to that, just might not be right for them to do. Other parents want their kids to do a sport or serve on the student council but they might not realize how it can affect their kid. The same goes for the principal too. They said that all students must participate in at least one activity but what if they can't?

The principal should listen to students' opinions and what they want to do instead of having to do these activities that they told them to do. Every student has a right to state their own opinions and the principal should listen to them. If the students don't want to do the activities that the principal told them to do, he or she should listen to them. They all have their own reasons to why they decide to either do the activities or not. Maybe the school should listen to what they have to say. If it's important to them then it matters.

I believe that we should let the students decide on what they rather feel like doing. They should talk to the principal first. They should listen to what their students have to say. If they want to do an activity then they should. But if they decide that they dont want to have to do these activities or they just can't do them, to talk to the principal. We should all do something that we would enjoy doing but if we just don't feel comfortable then we shouldn't.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
9AB67EA76820,"Do you think students should have to participate in extra curricular activities? I think we shouldn't as some people may not have the time to do them or just may not want to. Some people may not like sports or just are not very good a them. Some people may not want to do anything and may just want to do homework or be with friends. There might not be enough or any options they might like. Here are some more reasons why.

The reasons why some people may not be able or want to do yearbook would be that some people may not show up to get their picture taken or they may not have the time to get to a person. Some people may not want to get their picture taken. It can be stressful sorting out whos in what grade and if they do any extracurricular activities which ones. People may get stressed over yearbook for not having enough time or things in it.

The reasons why some people may not want or be able to participate in student council would be that some people may not be able to do it they might have tight schedules and might not be able to go to the meetings after school. It can be stressful trying to figure out what to fix and helping others. Decision making might be hard as it can help some but hurt others and certain people might make bad decisions.

There are some reasons why not everyone would want to do sports to like some people might be handicapped or unfit to play sports. Some people may not like sports or may not have time after school to play them. Some people may get stressed over practices and homework. I feel like it would also just not help as some people may get bullied or laughed at for messing up.

Another problem would be that not everyone has enough time to actually do these things like some people may have family issues or need to be picked up by a certain time. Some things may take a long time and might cause problems to people who have to do homework. Some people might be sick or have to be places at a certain time.

This is why not everyone might be able to do after school activities and why I think its a bad idea.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
84305C417C4B,"Extracurricular activities should be mandatory because kids could look forward to activities after school instead of going home and sitting around for hours. It would help kids stay out of trouble, keep students active, and help students build a social life.

Making students stay after school would help them stay out of trouble. Most students parents have and office job. The average work time is from 9am to 5pm, and school gets out at around 2pm- 4pm, so most kids are left unsupervised for around 2-6 hours. Kids left alone can get into all sorts of trouble and can be persuaded to do things that they know they should not do. Kids can be convinced to do drugs, join gangs, and vandalize public property. Instead of doing these things they can be supervised at school doing something that is fun and enjoyable instead of being mischievous. The school environment would be much safer because students wouldnt be influenced be other people to do any bad things, so they would not be doing or selling drugs and they would not be in or associated with a gang. Therefore, students would not bring in bad things into our schools. Making students stay after school would help them stay out of trouble, and stay good people.

The second reason that students should have to participate in an after school activities is because it is a way to get kids out of the house and encourage them to do something with their lives. Some kids go home and play sports outside or play a game with their siblings, but most kids go home and play video games for 5 hours till they have to eat dinner or go to bed. This is very unhealthy. An extracurricular activity would get a person who usually plays lots of video games to do something active. They could play sports after school and they would still have time for video games. Playing sports after school could convince them to play sports for fun, not because they have to do something after school and they could join a league and exercise more than just after school. This would help kids stay active and healthy. After school activities for all people is a good idea because it would help kids stay active and healthy.

Finally, making kids stay after school would help students build a social life. During the school day some kids do not socialize with others because they are tired, shy, or they are very focused on academics. After school, activities would really help kids gain a social life. After school activities are laid back and are made too do something active after school, not to secretly trick kids into too staying an extra hour after school. The activities after school are fun, they are meant to be. Kids after school who are shy can communicate with others because the activities give them ways to start of conversations and communicate with others.

In conclusion, Extracurricular activities should be mandatory. This would help kids stay out of trouble because it would keep them doing something healthy instead of something mischievous. It would students kids stay healthy because it would force them to do something active. and finally, it would help students because it would help students gain a social life because they could communicate with others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
478A901B5D00,"Whether the students should participate in a extracurricular activity or not should be the decision of the students. Some students could find the activities to not be enjoyable. Also, it wouldn't be very fair for someone else to decide if they should have an extracurricular activity. It should be up to the students.

As a result of forcing the students to partake in activities, they may not take interest in them. They wouldn't find them to be fun. If the students had to take an extracurricular activity, they could just see it as another boring class. And they most likely wouldn't want to stay in school for longer than they had to. And though it's true that some students enjoy activities such as sports, student council, and working on the yearbook, others might not. They might just find them to be boring.

Another reason why extracurricular activities should be optional, is because it would be fair otherwise. If someone else chose for them to participate in something they didn't need or want to, it wouldn't be fair. The students should be able to decide. It is true that being in an activity can be beneficial, but the students shouldn't be forced into them.

Finally, the activities are not supposed to be required. It has the word extra in it for a reason. Extracurricular activities shouldn't be a requirement. They should be a choice. A decision for the students to make for themselves. It's important for them to be able to do that.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities should not be required. They should be a choice for the students. If the students needed to participate in the activities, the students may be uninterested and bored. They may feel that it would be unfair to push them into joining an activity. They should be the ones to choose whether they join one or not.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
9B14802F55B8,"I agree with this decision because I believe extracurricular activities help young people in many different ways! Extracurricular activities helps us have lower stress levels, learn to be social and work with others, and help us find who we are. Extracurriculars also expand our horizons and give us opportunities and new passions we otherwise wouldn't have known about! Extracurricular activities also make you more well-rounded because then you won't only be in school but you'll also have another responsibility to take care of.

My first reason to why we should have at least one extracurricular is because they help us balance our lives and learn new skills. When school is becoming very stressful, other activities can take your mind off of it and help make you more relaxed. When I am feeling very stressed about something I like to bake things because it takes my mind off all other things I need to worry about! They can also help us with social skills. People aren't always good at working in a group or being a social person. Being able to work in a group is a very useful skill and being on a team can help you learn to be good at that! Some extracurricular activities can teach you valuable things like those.

Volleyball helps me take focus off things that are happening in my life. For example, one day at school I was having a really tough day and I came home super upset and did not want to go to practice but my parents made me. During practice, my teammates expressed how they also had a bad day and talking about it made me feel a little better. Playing that day really took my mind off my awful day because I was so distracted by trying to play well and work my hardest that I forgot all about my day at school!

Another reason why I think we should have extracurricular activities is because they expand our horizons! They help us find new talents we otherwise wouldn't have discovered. You never know if you'll be good at something if you don't try it, and that's what extracurricular activities are for! They can help you showcase your hidden talents and give you new opportunities. Extracurricular activities are also such a fun experience, they can make you so passionate about them if you find the right one for you!

As I mentioned before, I started playing volleyball in fourth grade and since then I've become very invested in it. Before trying volleyball I tried other sports like soccer and gymnastics but I wasn't passionate about any of them. Now I play on a travel team for volleyball and I love the sport so much! It's helped me discover talents I never knew I had before. I never would have known that I can jump high, work well in teams, or give good pep-talks if I hadn't decided to try volleyball!

My last reason for why I think extracurricular activities are helpful is that they make you a more well rounded person. Excelling at school is great, but having another activity really makes you seem more balanced. For example, high school students don't only have school to worry about but also extracurricular activities! If you have more extracurriculars you look balanced and it shows that you dedicate time to work hard in school and in your activity! This helps you develop a habit to work hard in more than one thing which will pay off a lot in the future.

Extracurricular activities such as sports, theater, debate, etc. help so much in trying to get into college. You stand out as a person who can do more than excel at school! Playing volleyball helps me look more well rounded because it's a huge commitment! I have to work so hard to be able to travel every weekend while still doing well in school! It's made me really focus on getting assignments in on time which is really eye opening!

Before I move on to my closing statement, I would like to share about how extracurricular activities help me in my daily life. Volleyball really helped me learn how to balance school and my activities. I learned how to complete my homework days before it's due, how to study for tests quickly and efficiently, and how to catch up on school work after I miss some days for a tournament. My other activities also really help me with stress because I know after a hard day I can go to practice and play my best because of how frustrated I am, or I can bake something tasty and have a nice snack and it really takes my mind off what I'm worrying about!

In conclusion, I think having every student participate in at least one extracurricular is a great decision! I agree with this decision because activities help us control our stress levels and teach us valuable social skills. Another reason is because they give us new opportunities and showcase hidden talents we may have not known we had. My final reason is that they help us look more well balanced and shows that we put time and effort into excelling in school and in our extracurricular activities as well. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
2EAFA0911EC3,"Our principal at my school has edcided that he wants to make all students attend in at least one extracurricular activity. I do not agree with this statement, doing that would put more stress on kids as a whole. If he did add that rule than it would either add time to school, or make the rest of the classes shorter so they can fit it in. Some kids also do not enjoy any of the options there would be, so that would just make te kid do a class he doesnt need or want to do.

Stress is a thing that kids already have to deal with because of other classes that they already have in school. Adding an extra class or activity they have to do could either mess them up mentaly or mess up their schedule outside of school. Some kids have killed them self because of school and school only, adding that extra class would really not be good for the kids brain.

Another issu would be adding time or taking time out of school. If the class they took was in school they would have to shorten their other classes to fit it in or even leave a class they are already in. If their activity is outside of school that means that they would have to stay at school longer after school is over. That yet again could mess up a kids schedule if they already had things to do when school was over.

Most of the kids would be bored out of there mind and just not enjoy the activity what so ever. Lets say a kids parentforced them to join chess club, that kid at first liked chess when he was learning it but when he knew all of the rules he didnt like it and it got boring. If there was an option to change clubs if they added this rule then he could just leave it. There is still a chance though that he didnt like any of the other clubs or couldnt do any other clubs so if that happens, he is stcuk in a boring club.

Money would also be an issue with this rule. Not only would some kids not have money to buy equipment they need for the club the school could also at a time not have enough money for the club. Lets say that happened, that means that club either gets shut down or is garbage because they dont even have the budget to make it happen. Just like i said before even if the school did have the money some of the kids would not be able to buy equipment which would mean they cant do that club and would be stuck in a different one that they may not like.

Another issue is having to build things for a new club. Now this probably would not happen but there is still a chance that it would, If they added a volley ball club and they didnt have a volley ball net or volley balls than they would have to build a net or maybe even a new gym for the club. Here is where another issu comes in and that is the budget, you need money to order new equipment. No equipment means no club no club means that the kids who wanted to do this club cannot do it and they have to choose a different one that they may not like or takes time after school which messes up there schedule for things out side of school.

Now if you do not get my point for all of the things i just said, All of my issues connect to one and other. Adding this to the school would just make the school worse and cause more issues than the school already has. In my opinion it is pointless to add it and would just mess up the whole flow of school that they already had, and to be honest the school board would probably not approve this addition so it was overall just a dumb idea that the principal had. Thats all i have to say, i hope you enjoyed this response.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
20B859376593,"What is every student participated in extracurricular activities? I believe students should participate in extracurricular activities because they can make new friends, be involved in something after school or on the weekend and make a change to their community.

If every student did some kind of a extracurricular activity, they could all get at least one person that can be called your friend. Everyone needs that one person that plays football with you, helps you with your homework, and cheers you up when you're down. Imagine how many new friends you would make with extracurricular activities.

If every student did some kind of extracurricular activity, instead of eating potato chips and watching T.V, they could be playing soccer with friends, or making clothes for the homeless. Think of all the free time you have, and what you could be doing with that time if you participated in a extracurricular activity. Even if it's just playing chess and checkers with friends, think of what you would be doing right now if you were at you're house.

If every student did some kind of extracurricular activity, like volunteering at a local pet shelter, or helping your family pay for college, that is still making a change to you're community. Imagine if some students chose to make something as small as raising enough money for a new slide at the local park, or even raising enough money to build a brand new local park. Some people may choose to work and help pay for their college, or buy a special gift for their parents anniversary, it's still affecting the community in some way.

If every student did extracurricular activities, they would make new friends, be involved in something after school or on the weekend, and they would make a change to their community.                                                                       ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
FC15D48EB587,"School days are very long, due to that students don't get to spend enough of their own free time. A standard school day is anywhere between 6-7 hours and that takes up almost one third of a students day. So why should students take another 1 or 2 hours to participate in extracurricular activities? I believe students don't need to participate in after-school activities because they should spend their free time however they want, they may also have issues to take care of at home, and not everyone likes the extracurricular activities.

These activities may also not suit everybody. For example, participating in sports,working on the yearbook, and serving on the student council may not fit somebody who is a musician. Students have a full day of school and want to hangout with friends or have fun in there free time, so these activities can also make people get out their comfort zones, some people may not be very social, while maybe somebody has basketball practice 3 times a week. Not everybody has the time for these activities, I know personally I like to spend time with my parents since they're at work all day and I'm at school all day. So you might not be able to talk or connect with your family a lot. It's the students free time they should pick what to do with it. I still think if you would like to participate in these activities, why not. Although not everyone has to participate in these after-school activities. I think also kids might be getting tired and want to go home, instead of staying and waiting at school all day.

On the other hand people may think that having one extracurricular activity will help students be more happy and it's better for them. After-school activities can help you meet new people, socialize, have fun and many more things. Although this only works for some students that's why it should be voluntarily. Because, for example, Some students could be very stressed out with school and need a break and that's what they use their after-school time for. So it's not good for the school to come and interrupt their daily schedules. There are also plenty of various problems students face like being bullied or having mental issues, so the best place for them would be home. Many students also have busy schedules and schools want to interfere with it.

In conclusion, students may be busy, the activities don't interest them, they don't spend enough time with family, or have many other problems. So the school shouldn't interfere with that and doing extracurricular activities should be voluntarily chosen. You should also be able to choose what to do with your free time, because you just had a whole day of school and need to have fun and relax. It's not healthy to be stressed out that's why after-school you should use it as a relaxation time. That's why I believe students don't need to participate in after-school activities because they should spend their free time however they want, they also may have issues to take care of at home, and not everyone likes the extracurricular activities.                               ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
BC1F674402CA,"When I was younger my mom made me join a musical. I was not very fond of the Idea, but after a while I grew a custom to it. I ended up meeting a lot of new people, and enjoying singing. Extracurricular activities can be fun because there are so many options. Now the principal proposed, ""All students are required to be in a extracurricular activities."" I agree with his proposal, because you can obtain relationships, stay active, and it would give you a general sense of skill.

For starters, you could have amazing relationships with others. In time those friendships could help you out in the future. You never know if the friend you make will be a celebrity and you could be well known because of them. Through tough times or just for entertainment, it brightens up life to have someone with you.

Second, it would keep you active. Its better to be active than laying on the couch all day doing nothing. It is a known fact that staying active can lead to a longer life span. If you stay active on a daily basis you can be more mobile, and not have to sit in a wheel chair everywhere they go. staying active is something tat keeps your mood up even without you knowing.

Third, it would help with life skills in general. If you needed a job, the skills you learned with the extracurricular activity you did in middle school will help you out. Multiple extracurricular activities look good on collage applications, so when you are applying for a scholarship. And if you have skills you could teach others.

In conclusion, having extracurricular activities as a requirement is great because of the friendships, the general sense of skill, and the fact of being active whether it is your brain that is working or your physical body. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A4BAA826534F,"At first thought you may think that extracurricular activities are a terrible idea due to it meaning that your are taking extra classes. On the contrary actually. My thoughts about these activities correspond with our principles. They can help you work in teams, it gets you up and moving, and it may also mature you mentally.

If you sit in a classroom all day taking notes, not talking or working with anybody, how will you ever learn to work and coopperate with others.. Team sports are a fantastic way to learn to work with others. In order for a good team to be successful, they need to learn to work with their teammates. Debate club is also a fenominal way to learn to work with others. Although debates in the debate club are 1 on 1, you use others for support. Also, in order to come up those ideas you need to discuss them with your team for support and feedback. The student council helps you to learn how to compromise with others. I personally was on the debate club a couple years ago, and it taught me lots about how you don't always get your way and that in order to progress to a goal you need to take others ideas into account as well. People may prefer working by themselves, but working with others is a necessary skill in order to suceed in the future.

Obviously sports are a great way to excersise. 38% of kids in America don't play a single sport. If you play sports after or before school it can get you up and moving outside of the house or a classroom. This extra class is an easy and free way to help you lose weight or to stay in shape. I read an article on

The Washington Post that said that over 52% of students around the globe between the ages of 10-13 are slightly overweight. If students could choose to play a sport after school then maybe that number could decrease. I personally used to be overweight. I didn't play any sports and I didn't leave the house that often. My school offered an after school basketball program that got me interested in participating in sports. From then on I've done several sports such as swimming, basketball, and football.

Sports can definetly be a great after school activity that students take part in.

There is no question that taking extra classes can help you mature your brain and expand your intelligence. Schools offer several classes to help students keep up in class and excell in what they're learning. My school offers science and math clubs that allows students take practice tests, solve challenging problems, and play games at the same time. Some classes may seem exciting but they may also assign you colosal amounts of homework. With the extra homework you may have to dedicate extra time to finishing it. The extra homework can teach you responsibility because although it may not be a grade, it's something that you have to do in order to gain any benefit from the class. It can also teach you to manage your time. You need to make some room on your agenda to finish all the work. My friend Generic_Name took 2 science classes ( one after school) because he was sure that's what he wanted to pursue when he grew up. It taught him many new things that most people at his age don't know. As you can see extracurricular activities can expand and mature your brain.

I strongly agree with our principle that there should be a mandatory extracurricular activity because it helps you learn to work with others, gets you up and moving, and can mature you mentally. You should go tell your principle about this topic to make it happen.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
B81A81BDA987,"Having students participate in an extracurricular activity is a good idea and is very beneficial to students.

Students will be able to get life and job experience from participating in extracurricular activities. A student participating in yearbook or student council would get good experience and help them decide what job they want to do. A student that does yearbook and decides they really like it might try and pursue a job in journalism, a student that participates on a sport team might try and pursue a job on a sports team. Participating in sports would give students good teamwork and communication skills, which many jobs are looking for.

Students will be able to make new friends by participating in extracurricular activities. A student on a sports team would be able to make new friends even if they are new. I have met many friends of mine through after school clubs, and some through sports. Being in an extracurricular activity would help some kids become less shy and allow them to come out of their shell. A few people I know have been able to talk to more people and be less shy because of doing other activities out of school.

Participating in extracurricular activities might help some students get better grades. At my school we have something called Math League. In Math League kids go and do a 5 question quiz and depending on how many they get correct it helps boost their grade up in the next test or quiz in math class by giving them a few extra points. At some schools yearbook is an elective, so participating in that will get you a good grade in your yearbook class. The only thing you cant get a good grade in is sports, but if you have a bad enough grade you will be kicked off the sports team.

Many people say that forcing a student to do extra activities out of school is bad, but I think it is a good thing! Having a student that participates more in an activity out of school might help them answer more questions in class or talk more. Being in an extracurricular activity will help students later in life and in school.

In conclusion, there are many good things about having all students participate in an extracurricular activity. Being able to make new friends, get better grades, and get experience is a very good thing for middle and high school students. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
11B659A6D867,"Many school, including the one I attend, have numerous extracurricular activities. These activities range from sports to chess club. There is a diverse amount of things you could do as an extracurricular that could cater to everyone. Enforcing a rule that students must participate in at least one extracurricular may seem hostile and violating to students, but if we focus on it precisely, it actually has a few positives to it. This doesn't mean that there are downsides to this decision but exceptions could always be made if needed. I agree with the decision to make participation in at least one extracurricular mandatory because it is important to branch out and be apart of something, it gives students more to learn and more to do for themselves, but it does come at the price that some students are not able to do extracurricular activities for certain reasons.

Being social is something important that we should all be able to do. It helps us throughout our teenage and adult life. We can help improve our social skills by joining a club or a team because then we have to learn how to interact and connect with new people. It's good to branch out and meet new people because you may meet someone new who could end up being your best friend. Being apart of a team or a club could also teach you teamwork and collaboration skills that are important to have when you become an adult. Starting early on these skills by doing an extracurricular will end up helping you in the long run.

Being in a club or on a team will inevitably teach you something whether it's big or small. Learning new skills or lessons through activities offered at school is a positive thing because they could always be applied to real world situations. When students are given new information, they are able to do more with and for themselves, which then builds character. It also creates more opportunities to do things with their lives. Students are involved in new hobbies which adds more to how their daily lives are and how interesting they are in general.

Of course, like any plan for schools or elsewhere, it isn't perfect. There's many things someone could say as to why they disagree with the principal's choice, but, it benefits the majority of people. Now this doesn't mean that there are no good counterclaims to this decision because there are. A good amount of students don't do any extracurricular activities because they just don't have the time or means to participate. A student may not have the money to buy all the personal equipment they need for a sport, or the transportation to and from the activity, or they simply have too much on their plate, like babysitting a younger sibling. A good solution to these issues is to have it discussed with a guidance counselor to find a way to fix these problems. They could find a way for the school to help pay for them to participate in a sport or they could help find someone to carpool with. if no solution can be find though, then the student should be allowed to exempt from participation if there is no other solution.

In conclusion, the decision the principal has made is one that could help every student benefit from. It can add a lot more to a student's life and change it for the better. There is a large enough variety of extracurricular activities that the majority of students will be interested in at least one. This new rule is intended to help students in the long run as this will make it easier to develop new and exciting skills for themselves to use. It helps them develop social skills and be apart of something big and they learn new things for themselves. However, they do come with negatives as I had talked about, but there are solutions to them. In all, mandatory extracurricular participation is a rule I'm on board with.                ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
7BB00D6357FC,"I think that extracurricular activities shouldn't be forced upon students. Many students may find the extracurricular activities to be stressful, like public speaking or playing a sport. The activities can also be very time consuming, students already have lots of homework and adding a extracurricular activity could cause their grades to drop because not finishing homework or outside of school projects because they wouldn't have time for everything. The name extracurricular activity has the word extra in it, meaning that it should be a choice, not a requirement for students to do.

The extracurricular activities could add stress, not every students can handle the stress from their activity. Some activities, like public speaking and sports. Students can find the activities stressful because if they might mess up and embarrass their self. If they stutter in their speech or strike-out in a baseball game, they could be embarrassed greatly because they were forced into they activity rather if they choose to participate.

The extracurricular activities can be be very time consuming, students don't need one more thing they have to do. Students already have homework and projects, they activity could add more stress on top of the stress from homework and projects. The students might not finish their homework and projects resulting in there grade dropping because of they activity

Lastly, extracurricular activities should stay extra, it's in the name. Forcing students to do an extracurricular activity wouldn't them make extra anymore, more like a required activity that everyone has to do, which can be stressful and time consuming for the student. Extracurricular activity should remain as an extra activity for the students that can handle it.

The activities being potentially stressful, very time consuming and the activity no longer being an extra activity are reasons why I think students shouldn't be required for each and every student to do. If a student that think they could benefit from participating in the extracurricular activity should do an extracurricular activity but every student should have to especially the students that would be negatively impacted by being forced to do the activity.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
EDC27501821A,"Over 85 percent of high school students do extracurricular activities without being told to do so. I would disagree with the idea of forcing someone to do school activities because the student should know what is good for them by themselves, and making someone do it for you could never help. When a school chooses that you need to do something you lose the idea that when your done with school you should still do that sport or club.

There are many clubs or sports that you can do in a school but still there are less or more depending where you go but there is always quite enough activities. The chances of not going to a certain activity are high and there is not a lot you can do about it. If there is a point where there are no more places left or just to little choices that you like the school would force you to do something you dont like, giving no use to do that activity. There are many outside clubs or sports from the community that people can join and many students do. The school could never know if you were to join or not, because they dont know what happens in your life which brings me to my next point.

Time management is something many people need to build or are still working on it but no one is ever done because things keep coming into you life. The school does not always know how many test you have to study for, or how your house is being rebuilt after something broke or anything small that can still affect someones life a lot. Those reasons are just few of the things that can surprisingly affect a lot of people and then too still have to put more work to do an activity is outrageous.

Making someone do something never seems to work for me my mom always told me to clean my room and I would do so but needed to make a fuss and fight about it for no reason. Now that I have grown a little older I do clean my room with no one telling because cleaning my room is no problem, but if my mom were to say I have to clean my room I would think of it as a crime against humanity, having no point and having it become a fight for no reason. The same idea can come to this argument that making something do it is worse than doing it yourself.

For a school to make a you do a activity is not fare and should not be done and doing so can harm the student in the future in many ways like time management, doing sports on your own without being told, or affecting there academics. Most students would already do a sport that they would like but not make it in because there are to many people, than this rule would force him to do a activity they would not like to do giving no point to do it anyway.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
B5DB0D021C61,"In our community, it is important to be actively involved. This not only helps those around you, but it can have a profound effect on you too. I think it is beneficial to have students participate in at least one extracurricular activity outside of school. This could be sports, clubs, or even volunteer work. Students get to know new people, have an impact, and even gain valuable life skills that will help them in the real world. I participate in a creative thinking program called Odyssey of the Mind. Since joining that program, I have made new friends, competed for my school, have become an effective problem solver, and have even seen improvement in my grades. I know getting involved after school could help other students.

One of the numerous benefits for joining after school activities is the fact that you meet new people. If you join a club or sport, you can meet others with similar interests. Students are also exposed to others with different backgrounds then themselves. Among meeting new people and making friends, this can help students who feel lonely, less lonely, and give them something to look forward too. In fact, 85 percent of people who join an after school activity would say that they made new friends, have better self esteem, and a stronger support system outside of school.

Doing something outside of school also gives students an opportunity to have an impact. Volunteering at a local animal shelter, or participating in programs like Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts gives them the opportunity to help out those in need, and provide services to them. If you participate in sports, you are making a positive impact on your overall health. Exercise releases a hormone that makes you happier. Clubs can result in students having a positive influence on each other. If you participate in Student Council, you are having a direct impact on those in your school.

Clubs and extracurricular also give students real world experience. In Odyssey of the Mind, collaboration is key to being successful. We work as a team to reach an overall goal. I would say that participating in Odyssey and other activities has made me a better team member. Extracurricular activities also establish a strong sense of responsibility in a student. If I am playing on the soccer field, I need to have been responsible by attending the practices, and practicing on my own in order to be a good asset. Clubs also help you with communication. In Student Council, we need to be able to effectively communicate with each other inside, and outside of school in order to truly make an impact.

Students everywhere have benefited from after school activities. As a result, students get to know new people, make an impact, and gain real world experience. With these benefits in mind, we know that extracurricular activities can be the turning point in a student's life, and lead to long term success. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
76D127736D17,"Your sitting in class, your teacher is droning on and on about plant cells, and then he gets an email. It reads: ""Please read this email aloud to your students. Dear students; as your principal I have noticed a lack of participation this past semester in after school activities. Because of this, starting on Monday all students will be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Thank you all for your cooperation. Sincerely, Generic_Name, Principal, Generic_School."" A murmur falls among the students, after a short while it settles but it is made very clear the students dont agree with this decision.

I'm one of those students. Students should not be forced to participate in a extracurricular activity. Students should have free choice of what they do with their free time not the school. Forcing students to participate in extracurricular activity is not a good idea because it can cause students to lose their time at home with family or just their own time and it may lead to issues with getting homework done because they don't have enough time.

Students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activity because it takes away from their home/ free time. Lets say your in tenth grade and you have a big research paper due next week, your halfway done with it and you should be finished in two days, which leaves you plenty of extra time in between and after to complete your other homework or just have some time to yourself. But then your teacher reads you that email, now your unwillingly playing basketball and that extra time you had is now gone. Basketball takes place three times a week. Sure you'll still get your homework done but now you have no time for yourself. Or maybe it affects your sleeping patterns. Just because your homework is still getting done on time doesn't mean your getting done on time. What used to be you asleep by 10:30 has now turned into you asleep by midnight with no time for yourself. Maybe it means you have to skip your nightly family dinner because your activity takes place during then, or your just to loaded with homework. Either way its not the right of the school to take away your home time they already take away a portion of it with all the homework you get. Taking students ""me"" time isn't right, it can lead to a unhealthy relationship with your family or cause you to lose sleep.

I touched on the other side of this point in that last paragraph, but what about homework? Let's assume that the principle decides he doesn't care about giving students me time, fine I can't stop him from feeling that way but there is one thing he didn't count on, grades dropping. By forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities you are taking away their ""me"" time which for some means their homework time. Students may not have enough time now to finish their homework or they may prioritize sleep and ""me"" time over it. It may even be used as an act of protest. If I was a student at Generic_School I would get a protest going, and get as many students to stop doing their homework and trying in school. Sure at first it would just drop our grades but if enough students did it then the school average would drop and then the school would have a problem. You shouldn't force students to participate in extracurricular's it may affect their grades or their care to succeed.

But some may say ""extracurricular's build character and help make a well rounded student."" But thats not true at all. It takes away a students right to choose. It takes away their character not build it. By forcing a student to do an extracurricular your taking away a part of that student, a part that made that student that student. His or her independence, his or her freedom, has been stolen, and that isn't the schools choice.

Students should be at their own will in what they choose to do after school, especially since their already required to do homework.

Students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities. It can cause them to lose time to themselves or their family at home and it could lead to them not completing their homework and their grades being affected. Why should a school be allowed to play ""in loco parentis"". ""In loco parentis"" is an old Latin phrase that means ""in the place of a parent"". So why should the school be able to play in the place of a parent. If a parent decides that they want their student to do an extracurricular thats the parent's decision. Students should not have to participate in a extracurricular activity.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
273FB0645ADE,"Here at Generic_School, students must take at least one extracurricular activity. Students have several exciting choices, they could participate in school sports, be in the yearbook class (help put the yearbook together), or serve on the student council. Extracurricular activities is a great requirement for many reasons. One reason being, it allows students to take a break from their core classes. It allows them to get their minds off of all the stress put on them from the work they are doing everyday in those classes. It is also just amazing to be involved in your school. If you want to be involved in football for say, you would get to walk around every time there was a game, in your jersey or cheer leading outfit. There are many other sports students could get involved with like basketball, volleyball, lacrosse, cross country, etc. You do not have to be involved in a sport, to be involved with your school. Sports are not for everyone, although depending on what extracurricular activity you participate in, you could get extra advantages.

Extracurricular activities are a great way to get your mind off of all the stressful work going on in your other core classes. During your classes, you have to always stay focused on the work your teacher is giving out. If you do not finish that work, you either have to turn it in incomplete or do it for homework if the teacher is being nice. If you get to do it for homework, along with all the other homework you already had, you will be up late trying to finish. What if your Parents/ guardian, makes you go to bed, and won't let you finish? Then you have to turn it in incomplete, or use it as a late work and finish it the next night. Either way, you would end up getting a bad grade on the paper. It may not be the worst grade, but it's not your best work, and you always want to have your best work to be turned in. If this ends up happening constantly, your grades will start to go down. another way your grades can go down is if you fall asleep in class. It's hard enough to stay awake in class, especially right after you eat lunch, and then you have to go sit in a dark classroom, listen to the teacher, and attempt to take notes. It's almost like the teachers want you to fall asleep. When you cannot communicate, it makes it very hard to stay awake. That's why taking extracurricular classes are good for taking a social break away from your core classes.

It is always good to stay involved in your school. Extracurricular activities are a great way to do that. You have three option choices, sports, student council, or yearbook. You can always do more than one, you could do all three if you really want to. If you want to do sports you have lots of options like football, lacrosse, volleyball, cross country, basketball, etc. If sports are not for you, then that's okay because you still have other options. Student council is a group of responsible, chosen students. You get picked in home base at the beginning of the year, when your teacher asks ""Who would like to be in student council?"" If you raise your hand, your classmates will vote who they think would be best for the part. If you are n student council, then you know about all the upcoming events before anyone else does. It is your job to make a poster and present it to your home base the next morning. If you decide to take yearbook, then your job is to help put all the pages together. You will get a partner, and you guys will have a minimum of 2 pages, depending on what your topic is. You get to choose the pictures, and get the write the summaries for your pages in the yearbook.

With some of the extracurricular classes at forest middle you could get some extra advantages. Sports wise, if you are on the football team, you get fed before every game. If you play either basketball or volleyball, you get open gyms on certain days of the week. Sports are an after school activity, whereas student council and yearbook are during school. So if you are in student council, then you get to miss 1 day, every month, to go socialize and make posters, instead of going to your 7th period. Also the next morning you get all the attention from your home base all to yourself, like you are the teacher. Student council probably is not for you if you don't like talking in front of people. Unlike yearbook, is an everyday thing, although some times throughout the week you will just have all period to chill, and not do anything. Every Friday is called relaxation Friday. Relaxation Fridays you either do nothing except play games on our chrome books, some times get our phones, go to sleep, color, do homework for other classes, or do little math puzzles, but you always have options for your free period.

Overall, it is a good thing that our principle is pushing students to be more involved, and becoming a part of extracurricular activities. It is next to impossible to hate your extracurricular class, because the point in having them is to make school a little more fun. It's giving students a break, letting them get more involved with what's going on, and you even sometimes get extra advantages. Who wouldn't love it? I know I love my extracurricular classes. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
9583FE0522BD,"I disagree with what the principal has decided on. For one people have stuff to do when they get home anyways. Students like myself also have a lot of homework when they get home from school. Some kids just can't go to any after school activities because their parents work a lot and no one can drive them. Forcing students to do something they don't want to do is bad anyways.

So when I get home from school on someday's I have to go to tutor, or boy scouts. That's two days out of my week that I have used up. Sometimes my week is completely full when soccer season comes around and sometimes I have nothing to do after school. Then I usually just hangout with some friends because who wants to go out of there way in mid march when the sun is shining bright to go do student council. Not me that's for sure I'd rather have fun then do something I don't want to do or didn't sign up for.

I know were in eighth grade and people say they get more homework than us and that's true but the amount we get is just horrendous. Picture this your about to hop on video games or go play with your friends and then you mom says ""Don't forget to do you math, science, civics, PE, German, and English homework."" Like where did all that homework come from because I don't remember marking in my agenda thirty different assignments to do. If anyone thinks eighth grade is easy it isn't I have to keep my grades above a B or my parents go ballistic so do you really think I have time to make a yearbook.

Some kids can't go to certain things on some days because both of their parents work late. When I was in like fourth maybe fifth grade I couldn't go nowhere after school because my parents both worked late. I had to go to a daycare after school sometimes because they wouldn't be home in time to unlock the door because I couldn't be trusted with a key for some reason. There were many clubs I wanted to do but couldn't.

This is why I would strongly disagree with my principal if he made us do after school activities. If I was sixteen and had a car I wouldn't mind driving myself to go to an after school activities but my parents get home late so that's not gonna happen. The amount of homework I have to do when I get back already takes like an hour to finish. Don't even get me started about how booked up my weeks are sometimes.

18A77D3DD491,"Have you ever wanted to do something fun, of your choice after school? It would be good for schools to make every student have to do at least one extracurricular activity. There are many reasons it should be mandatory for all students to do extracurricular activities. Students should all do an extracurricular activity because it can make them try new things, students could make new friends, and could help them get more skilled at things they like.

Firstly, an extracurricular activity can help students learn new things in many ways. One way is that they can push for the student to become more well rounded individuals, and force you to get better at something that you may not yet know you really love to do. For example, if you were to join a yearbook club and were tasked with making the front cover of the yearbook, but you are not an amazing artist then this is your chance to learn and get better at being an artist.

Secondly, a student is able to make more friends and meet cool new people at extracurricular activities rather than at school. Students are able to make more friends because they are able to meet lots of new people at these extracurricular activities, and are able to meet people who share interests with them like basketball, painting, or Dungeons and Dragons. As an example, a student who joined a drama club could find new friends who also like performing just like themselves.

Lastly, a student would be able to gain lots of skill by participating in an after school activity. They would be able to do so by collaborating with other people who may be more skilled than them or who have a different set skills that they could teach each other, a soccer player might show another how to dribble better while they show another how to guard the ball better. Students would also simply gain more time to practice the things that they like to do allowing them to get more experience.

In conclusion, although it might not seem right to force students to do extracurricular activities, it can help students become better people overall. For example, if a student were to join an after school basketball team then they would be able to get better at basketball and gain new friends who also play basketball with them. So finally, being forced to do extracurricular activities would allow students to learn new things, make new friends, and improve their skills.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
F5428139729A,"OUR PRINCIPAL JUST MADE SCHOOL BETTER!!! I bet your wondering how. He's making us students participate in at least one activity. I feel as if we do activity's we can have a good mindset because first, having a good mindset is a key in life; if you dont feel good about yourself then how will you win in life. It makes something hard and gives a challenge and lets us know that things dont come easy and go our way all the time the way we planned it. Say the activity is hard and the whole school is racing and competting in this challenge that the principle has assigned for us. We have to learn to strive for what we want and not just give up because we dont get it, or it's to hard. If you give up the how will you win the challenge, learn form your mistakes so you dont make the sameone again later.

However, if dont like it, its going to be a everyday thing so soon or later you going to like it, but look on the bright side; you get out of class, dont have to do work, and you get to socialize with your friends our other people you dont know, try to make new friends you never know those new friends could be better than your friends that you have now. At least you have something else to keep yourself active, instead of doing work.

Some people need it, but dont want to say anything because their embarssed they'll get joked on, peopke shouldn't be scared to work out, run, or just exercise in general in front of people, it's all personal refrence. I you dont want to work out they just need someone to push them, so they know that they have reason to get in shape.

Students that play for the school need it to. People are so tired of doing work and having such a long day at school dont feel like going to practice right after school.

Why are they doing extracurricular activities outside of school? Well it can improve their performance in schools, teach them valuable lessons that might help them later, and be a fun thing to do with their friends. Our principal has recently announced that all students must participate in at lest one extracurricular activity, and I agree with that statement.

One important aspect of extracurricular activities is that it often helps students perform better in school. A good example of this is taking an engineering or math related activity. Students who partake in such activities can learn skills in math that they can use in school to do better in their math class. It could also reinforce thought processes that they have already learned and so they could get better at that. But what about extra curricular activities that don't involve math, like sports? Well sports require your brain to think about a problem that could happen later in the game, then prepare for that. Thinking ahead is also very important in a learning environment, and those who didn't think ahead will likely reach an obstacle that they weren't prepared for. However, students who take extracurricular activities will be more likely to find ways to overcome this obstacle and excel academically.

Extracurricular activities will often teach students lessons that will help them throughout their life. Doing almost any extracurricular activity involves working with other people which can teach students the value of teamwork which will be important when the students grow up and get jobs of their own. Students can also prepare for their future job from extracurricular activities because if a student has decided what job occupation they want, then that student could take an extracurricular thats related to that job and get experience that would help them succeed in that field. One such example of this would be a student who had decided that they want to be a teacher, so they took tutoring as an extracurricular activity which would help them find ways to teach to their liking and give them an idea of what it's like to be a teacher. By doing extracurricular activities Students learn information and skills that will allow them to excel later in their life.

Another great reason on why extracurricular activities are good is because it allows students to spend time with their friends outside of school. Most students don't live close to their friends from school and won't be able to see them much outside of school. But, if two or more friends decide that they all want to participate in an extracurricular activity, then they would get to see each other more often and get new friends from the extracurricular activity. After students graduate, they likely will very rarely see their friends from school, and might remorse on the time they wasted not spending time with their friends. That's why extracurricular activities are a great way to spend time with friends.

Extracurricular activities are very helpful, they help students excel in school, succeed when they grow up, and allow students to spend time with their friends. I hope everyone agrees with the principal's idea since I believe that it would benefit the school and everyone in it. We should at least give it chance to show us the good it can bring and let us ll have more opportunities for success.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
A23348674832,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree because not all students like to participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

Some students don't like sports because they might not know how to do them or they might not like any sports. Like I'm not good at sports, and i don't really like sports .

Students should be able to do want they want either they do sports or they don't but they should get to choose what they want to do.

Maybe some students like to work on the yearbook and maybe some don't. If the principal is saying that student must join a least one activity and they join the yearbook club and what if they don't like working on the yearbook.

Student council might sound boring to some people or it might sound interesting. If the principal says that you have to join at least one activity and someone does not like to do sports or anything else and they decide to join the student council and what if they think it's boring and if they decide to choose something else then what will they pick because they don't like any other activity.

Over all i disagree because students should be able to do what they want like if they want to do a activity or if they don't.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
C25CA518A21F,"Extracurricular activities are commonly found at all schools. They range from basketball and football, to book club and yearbook club. There are limitless possibilities to extracurricular activities you could do. These activities are important because they allow you to make new friends and be social, get better at skills that arent taught in normal school, and they allow you to do something fun and participate in something besides school.

Being social is one of the most important aspects of life. Making friends, having fun and spending time with each other. When you are in school, you can talk to your friends but you cannot truly bond with them because you have school work that you need to focus on. When you have an extracurricular activity you are able to spend much more time with your friends as well as make new ones. In my personal experience, I play basketball daily, and I have met many of my closest friends while playing basketball. Without basketball I would truly have less close friends than I do now.

In regular school, you are taught all of the subjects that you are used to seeing. Math, science, English and even some special electives like shop. Although you have many choices to what you want to do, there arent as many choices or fun activities as extracurricular activities. If you want to do coding, there is a coding club, if you like reading, theres a book club, or if the only sport you like is basketball, you can do only that. The ability to do whatever activity you want, and limitless choices of those activities, are found no where else, even compared to school.

School is stressful, and when you only think about school, it gets worse and worse and a lot of people need a break from school. That is where these activities can help. They might be more work but they allow you to take your mind off of school and on to something completely different that can benefit you in the same way. If you only think about school and no other activities, you will stress yourself out over due dates, bad grades and much more. I am not saying that you shouldnt worry about these things but people overthink them and dwell on them which makes the student not feel good. If they had more extracurricular activities, they might not be as focused on those things and relax and enjoy the activities and school more.

Extracurricular activities should be a part of every students life and are extremely important to their success because of the social aspect, the fact that they are new activities with different skill sets, and they give you a break from school which allows you to think about something else. They can even make someone healthier, mentally and physically. They are important to the students and can change how they feel over their entire career as a student.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
8679D5C9C9C7,"Time, such a valuable commodity. Choosing how to spend your time is one of the many lessons to learn through adolescence. You could read a book, play a sport, study for a test, or procrastinate and play vidieo-games all day. Needless to say, time management is an important skill to learn and a freedom many enjoy. This is all why I strongly disagree with the principals new policy. All it is doing is restricting students rights and wasting their time, while requiring them to participate in a school sponsored activity they might havee no intrest in. For many kids, this system is just ludacris. Many already have packed schedules, have activities outside of school, or simply have no interest in school sponsored activities. All of these are valid reasons the principals new policy should be repealed.

Many students already have very tight packed schedules. Many cant handle homework or getting their work done on time. Taking an activity would do them more harm than good. For example, I am one of those kids. While I am definitely not bad at school, I am absolutely terrible at time management, which if I procrastinate too much causes my grades to dip quite a bit. With a policy of required activities, these kids, like me, would all be in even more of a struggle to complete their work. It would be complete pandemonium, rushing to get stuff done on time while also having to juggle a club or sport.

Speaking of clubs and sports, many kids associate with clubs or sports unrelated to school. From my understanding, this policy would require kids to take an activity sponsored by the school. This is simply absurd to many of these kids, who might already be in two or three activities, being told they have to take another. It would be chaos! I, for one, am a boy scout, and I play baseball in the spring and summer. If I was suddenly told that I would have to invest more time into extra curricular activities, many of which i personally have no interest in, I would be furious.

And thats another very big point. Many kids just dont have interest in any school sponsored activities. While a whole bunch of activities expand kids horizons and teach them valuable lessons, what is the point of those lessons if they dont care enough to listen to them in the first place. Whenever I am listening to somebody talk about something I really dont care about,

I forget everything within five minutes. A required activity a kid has no interest in would just end up being dead, wasted time, where the participant would learn nothing of value.

This new policy put forth by the principal, while it may seem like a good thing on the surface, is actually damaging our students. All it is doing is stressing out already stressed students, by requiring them to take another activity they have little to no interest in. Policies like this are just restricting students freedom, and having adults make decisions for kids. At this point in life, its very important to learn how to make decisions and manage their time. With this policy, the principal seems to want to restrict kids decision making power, and put stress where there was none before. All this is doing is worsening the mental health and shift into adulthood of our most valuable asset, our children.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
0DE08F4053C5,"I believe that there is no merit in requiring students to take part in an after school activity. I find that it is not beneficial for students to take part in activities outside of school. These activities give students no particular academic advancement or benefit. This time could be spend doing other things outside of school, for example sleep, homework, and extra help. Students also need time to themselves, so they can do the things that they enjoy. They want to have fun, and i am sure that there are more enjoyable things to do than spend more time at the place that students dislike the most.

First of all, most of the after-school activities give no benefit to the students. For example, yearbook will not help someone with their math exam. If you sign up for basketball this wont help with your science test retake on Monday. The time students waste on after-school activities could be better spent on this that will give them academic advancement or success. This will not give students the extra sleep, study time, or free time, this will only deplete it. There is no benefit in wasting more time at school where you wont be learning anything. I believe that students would appreciate it if the after-school activities were optional rather than mandatory. This would give students the option to attend and not the inconvenient requirement.

My second reason is that this time wasted on after-school activities could be used for better things. For example, extra help from a tutor so the student will be prepared for their exam. This time could also be used to get some sleep, which not only the students gravely need. Family is also a huge part of a students attitude inside and as well as outside of school, the student can use this time to spend with their family. The students acquire a substantial amount of homework every day, the tie after school ends is vital for students, because they need to complete the work that they acquire, which can be done more efficiently at home. It is simply unnecessary to require students to waste their time attending after-school when they have better things to be doing.

Finally, most students don't particularly enjoy school, they find it boring. The time after school is important for students, They can do the things that they enjoy. For example, They can play sports, play games, and they can spend time with their family, but the students can only do those things if they have the time. Having fun is not the only thing that students can do when they get home, they also have work to do. If the time is wasted at school the student wont have the time or energy to do the things that they enjoy doing. The students deserve time to themselves so I cannot agree to a proposal that disrupts that. I believe that this is not the best decision for the students, Because they will not have the time to enjoy themselves.

So in conclusion, I disagree with the principal requiring students to attend after-school. It gives no particular benefit to the Student. Second, This ''after school'' tie can be used for better things. Finally, this takes away from the students personal time. Please consider the students when making decisions like this. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
80368BCB869B,"Before my grandfather passed away, he would always say,""Don't dislike things until you try it."" I feel the same about extracurricular activities. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Doing an extracurricular activity can reduce things things like stress and anxiety. It can also help with building teamwork and social skills with people within a team or club. Last but not least, it can boost their confidence and people will acknowledge them.

To begin with, an extracurricular activity can reduce distracting things in life such as stress and anxiety. on my first day of middle school, I decided to join the school's ,according to the band director, spectacular band program. After choosing and learning how to play my instrument, I felt that I could relax and take my mind off homework and other stressful things. Overall, the feeling of trying something new and something I enjoyed really helped to lower my anxiety and stress. After questioning my fellow band mates about how they enjoyed band, most of them replied that they will do it the following year.

After that, playing a sport or being in a club can help build social and teamwork skills with the people around them. Back when I was around eight, I played soccer with people in my school I had never met before. I was extremely nervous as if I was presenting an idea in front of a entire live audience in a stadium. Then we had a little talk with the coach and our teammates. After getting to know each other, I felt more and more comfortable as we moved through practices everyday after school. As we worked on our skills and communication, both my teammates and I were getting better. Before the tournament, we were ready to face off against the best team in the league. Our practicing paid off and we won the tournament and large trophies.

Last but not least, extracurricular activities and boost one's confidence and morale. It can also give the person more acknowledgment. When ever people in sports or teams win game they are boosting and more happy. According to a study, 86% of all students that play sports also do better at school and tests than students that don't.

Most studies even show that happiness is like a domino effect. When one person sees someone else happy, they also feel more enjoyed by the joy around them and so on. When a certain group or team keeps winning, they are noticed as a team that is better. They reach that status because they work hard and it comes out to a great profit. Anyone could be that team if they work hard enough.

In conclusion, students should participate in any extracurricular activity that they prefer to join. Main reasons is that it reduces anxiety/stress, builds skills in teamwork and communication, boosts confidence, and gives acknowledgment. Altogether, participating in an extracurricular activity can bring benefit to anyone who tries. Like my grand father used to say,""Don't dislike things until you try it.""                                                                                 ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
16271A900F31,"If the principal ever decided that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity, I would strongly disagree with that idea. After the bell rings at the end of the day, students should have the freedom to do what they wish with their extra time. I am sure that if this happens, most students would not be happy with that, including myself. It is good to have extracurricular activities outside of school, but you cannot force it upon someone. It would be a good idea to encourage it, but not to force it. I think this rule would be unfair because it takes away student's freedom to leave school after the final bell rings, students should decide what they wish to do after school, and school is already very stressful, piling more school related activities on top of school would be extremely stressful, and someone higher up in the education system should make that decision, not the principal.

If this rule was ever put into place, it would take away student's freedom to leave school after the final bell rings. This shouldn't even be the principal's rule anyway. If this unfair rule was ever enforced, the county or someone higher up than the principal should make this decision. Most students including myself, just want to go home and talk to their friends. I am an honor roll student, play two competitive sports, and I am also in the National Junior Honors Society, and putting even more activities on my calender would be very stressful. It is not good to just be lazy and sit around all day, but the school cannot decide what to do for you after the bell has already rung. Even if this rule was enforced nationwide, I still dont think this rule would be the slightest bit fair. Making a student stay after school and do an after school club, would actually make a good punishment for a student who has done something wrong, but forcing busy, well behaved students do that would be extremely unfair. Making a student stay after school is the whole idea of after school detention, which is used as a punishment.

Students should decide to do what they wish after school. Most days of the week I have baseball, basketball, I go to the gym, and have 30-60 minutes of homework. A lot of the time, I have two of those on the same day, sometimes even three! I am not forced to do any of those activities, I choose to do them. If the student was forced to do an extracurricular activity, that would be something their parents would decide, not the principal. All of my friends including myself strongly dislike school, but most of us are on the honor roll and do other activities, not involving the school. Besides, what benefits is the principal going to get out of forcing something upon their students? When I leave school at the end of the day and finish my homework, I want to get as far as I can get from school. Most days after school, I take a few hours of down time to relax, and a few hours of non-school related activities. I am a very productive, well balanced person, and being forced to put extra activities on top of the ones I already have, would enrage me.

School is already stressful, so piling more school related activities on top of school would be extremely stressful. Being overwhelmed with school, whether you are being bullied or you are failing your classes, can lead to depression. Many cases of teen depression have to do with school. I enjoy being productive and participating in activities, but not when it comes to school. Making students do after school activities would be a very shallow-minded thing to do, given the fact that most students dislike school. It is good to encourage students to go to extracurricular activities, but not to force them. In high school I intend to be on one of my school's sports teams, but I am making that decision on my own. Besides, maybe you dont enjoy any of the after school activities. I am already forced to come to school for seven hours a day, and adding another hour or two on top of that would be very tiring and stressful. Doing extracurricular activities are great for you, but not when you are being forced. Just thinking about staying after school for an extra hour or two stresses me out.

Someone higher up in the education system should make that decision, not the principal. If this ever actually became a rule, It would be followed by more than just one school. It would either be countywide, statewide, or nationwide. I am not saying that I agree with this rule but if this was ever passed, the principal wouldnt have the power to force students to do this. The principal does not have the ability to pretty much extend our school day. That would be something decided by higher up people, like the governor, president, or board of education. The principal just enforces the rules, not creates them.

This rule would make many students angry. It wouldnt make anyone happy, because the students that want to do after school activitiess, can still do them just as easily. No one gets any benefits from this rule. Making students participate in after school activities would probably encourage students to cut class more often, and maybe just not even show up to school at all. You can be a well rounded person without having to attend after school activities. Again, I think this rule would be unfair because it takes away student's rights to leave after the final bell rings, students should decide what they with to do after school, piling more school related activities on top of school would be very stressful, and someone higher up in the education system should make that decision, not the principal.                ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
C1A275127D98,"Boom! Generic_Name kicks the soccer ball as hard as she can towards the goal. The goaly is surprised but quick on her feet as she thrusts herself towards the ball and catches it before it reaches the net. The referee blows the whistle and that is the end of the game. Generic_Name has not only let herself down, but her team as well. Each team shake hands with each other and leave the field. You have an expression on your face that describes disappointment and anger. Our school's principal, Generic_Name then looks at you from the bleachers and calls you over. As you make your way across the field, you keep yourself questioning yourself. What did I do? Am i going to be kicked off the team? Am I not good enough? Generic_Name asks you whether or not you think everybody at school should do at least one activity or sport. Generic_Name disagrees with this statement because students have after school activities they do that include sports, private lessons, and even classes.

Sports are a great way to exercise and distract yourself from school or even things that are stressful. There are different types of sports including football, soccer, baseball, basketball, tennis, etc. Imagine yourself running across the field with a football. The game is about to end and you are tied with the other team 21-21. You are so close to making a touchdown when out of the corner of your eye, you see the other team sprinting toward you. You run faster and sprint across the field and make the touchdown. The score is now 22-21 as the whistle blows the end of the game. Your team picks you up and runs you across the field, yelling and screaming your name, ""Generic_Name! Generic_Name!"". Generic_Name looks your way and smiles as your still questioning. Did I change his mind? Will students be able to make their own choices of what they want?

Private lessons is another activity that most likely will be after school. There are many lessons people take and most of them are orchestra and band lessons. Orchestra lessons include the violin, viola, cello, and bass. For example, say you play the violin and you signed up for lessons. You feel the light, warm breeze on your arms as you make your way inside. You're then lead to a room where you see all the instruments of the orchestra. The instructor tells you to play a D major scale. As you spend an hour doing scales and playing music, you're time ran out and it is time to go home. You feel the slightest touch against your shoulder and as you turn around. The instructor is holding a music book for you to practice. You then take the book and make your way home.

Classes include usually art or wood making. In the wood making classes, you're given a block of wood and instructions that give you a task you must complete. In art classes, the instructor guides you through the process for your assignment and gives you the materials. After she tells you what your doing, you're then allowed to start on your own to accomplish the assignment. The art materials include paint, crayons, colored pencils, shading tools, chalk, paint brushes, etc. The wood making classes include a block of wood, sandpaper, and machines throughout the class to cut off a piece from the block. Generic_Name loves art and does painting herself with a paintbrush and a holder with different colored paints. Generic_Name also has an easel to hold her artwork, a stool to sit, and a basket with all her colored paints.

Students at school should have a choice on whether they want to do an activity or a sport. People can't make decisions for others but they can make decisions for themselves. Generic_Name shouldn't have students pick school activities over after school activities. Students shouldn't have to choose something for school and have to give up something they enjoy after school for that certain activity or sport. Imagine yourself falling into a deep hole and have to decide over two things to get out. One choice you want but it will affect your life while the other choice wouldn't but you would not enjoy it. How would you feel? What would you choose? I disagree with this statement because many students have after school activities that may include sports, private lessons, and classes that they enjoy and are not ready to give up yet. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
AFA633EBCCAA,"I agree with students having to participate in at least one extracurricular activity a week. Making students participate in one or more extracurricular activities a week, can improve a students mental and physical health. One way extracurricular activities could benefit a student, is that it could improve their time management skills. Another way, is that it could make their chances higher, of a college noticing and accepting them. A third way of extracurricular activities helping a student, is that it could help students make more friends.

A students time management skills could be improved while taking an extracurricular activity, because it forces a student to figure out a way to do their extracurricular activity, while still keeping up with their school and home life. It also makes them plan out when to do things, like homework, so they can get everything done on time. When a student doesn't take any extracurricular activities, their time management might not be as good as someone who does. Students who don't do an extracurricular activity, might not manage their time unlike someone who does sports or other clubs, which could negatively impact their time management skills in the future.

It's good for students to do an extracurricular activity other than school, because it makes their chances higher of colleges accepting them. A student could have a higher chance of getting noticed and accepted into college, when they participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because it makes them stand out. When you don't take an extracurricular activity, you might not get accepted into a college that you want, because colleges look for something that makes you different. Colleges like to see students that can stick to the same activity without constantly switching their extracurricular, so it's good to start your extracurricular as soon as possible. Colleges also look for students that can balance their school and personal life, like clubs and sports, while still maintaining good grades.

Taking an extracurricular activity can also help a student make more friends. Extracurricular activities can do this, because everyone in their extracurricular, has that team or club as a common interest. Making friends in the same extracurricular activity as you, should be a little easier because you already know that they like that same activity as you. You could also feel more comfortable with them, because of the interest that you both share. Taking an extracurricular activity, and making friends in it, could help you make really good lifelong friends.

In conclusion, I agree with my principal saying, that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities, help improve a students time management, by making them balance their extracurricular activity and school work. Improves their chances of getting accepted into college, because colleges like to see students doing activities outside of school. Helps them make friends with the same interests as them, that they could keep forever. And many other wonderful experiences.    ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
92E9A4B7A6D0,"Students Should Not Be Forced to Attend Extracurriculars.

There are many people who think that students should have to do an extracurricular activity. However, this is not a great idea. Though there are many beneficial reasons to do so, they get in the way of the students wishes or makes the day a more inconvenient for parents. Extracurriculars should not be forced on students because the students should have full freedom as to how they wish to spend their day, it makes the day more inconvenient for many busy parents, and it can distract from schoolwork and homework.

Though it can be said that extracurricular activities would make the students more active and would teach them valueable life lessons, the decision of whether to include these should come from the students or the parents. Students should be able to have freedom as to how to spend their days. Nobody in the United States is forcing working adults to do community service in order to help their community, so we shouldn't be making students have to do extracurriculars. Sometimes parents can make their children go into extracurriculars despite their child's wishes, but that is more of a family-based decision, and the school should not have anything to do with this.

Many parents who work at home or have businesses of their own, such as a freelance business, might have trouble clearing out the time necessary to pick up their children. This is especially true when you have students that live far away from the school. Most extracurriculars won't be able to have busses to go to and from them, because schools cannot afford this expence. This puts the responsibility of picking or dropping off the student at their extracurriculars on the parents instead of the school. The students should only be attending extra-curriculars only if the parents are fine with them doing so. Finally, It could be said that these parents could simply clear out a piece of their schedule to take their kids to their extra-curriculars, but for some parents who run busy businesses of their own it may actually cost them to have to clear out that time.

Extracurriculars make the day more exciting and less mundane for some students, but what if the same thing could bore or distract the students? Along with the fact that extracurriculars would make the day more exciting for some students, it offers more things to be distracted with, as students might be distracted from schoolwork or homework because of an extracurricular they did not wish to attend. Also, if the main reason why the student didn't choose an extracurricular activity to attend was because they didn't like any of the choices, it may actually make the student's day less fun. Therefore, making them less willing to do more intensive schoolwork. There are many people, which didn't attend extracurriculars before, who may have struggled to finish their homework on time, and forcing these people to attend extra-curriculars basically makes it more difficult to it on time. Students who have already attended afterschool activities, who will not be affected, voluntarily attend these and know how to plan out their schedule, but many students have not had this experience before.

It could be said that extracurriculars could make the year better for the students in the long run, but we should not be forcing students to be attending extracurriculars. Forcing students to attend extracurriculars limits how they wish to spend their day, it makes the day much more inconvenient for many parents, and it also could worsen school performance for some. Students are no different than any other citizen. Thus, the school should not play a part in how the student wants to spend his or her free-time. Parents may not be willing to drive their child to and from extracurriculars every day, and it may make the day much more inconvenient to them. Plus, the child should only be able to attend extracurriculars if the parents are fine with it. Extracurriculars also get in the way of the student's schoolwork and homework. It distracts them from school and could worsen performance in some students. From all of this, it would be a terrible idea to force student to have to do extracurricular activities. Would you want to be forced to do community service? The same applies to your family.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
B72C8D543253,"I agree with the idea about how kids should have at least one extracurricular activity at school like sports or clubs at school.

There are many reasons why extracurricular activities are a great idea for students, like homework club where you can work with your friends and finish any not finished or late work and work on your homework or any projects and once you finish with your homework you can help your friends with their home work and you can work with your teachers and work with anybody else who can help you with skills for homework and test and who can help you study for them.

Another activity is playing sports at the gym you are able to play basketball, soccer, football, and more and whichever sport you want to play ask some friends to play with you and your friends could practice and get better at the sport and if you et a lot better maybe you could join your schools basketball or football team which counts as another activity and if you do join the team you can get to meet and know more about new people and your coach and they can help with some tips and ways to get better at the game, but always remember to have fun.

Next, you can join year book club where you and a group of people and work on making he year book, there is probably gonna be new people, so you can try making new friends and you guys can try making ideas about how the year book could look like and how you guys would set it up and at the same time having fun with your friends make crazy or funny ideas.

This club is really helpful with joining a school team and it is in high school, there is a weight lifting club which can really help you with your arm and leg muscles and body muscles too, it's very helpful because if your gonna join a school team or any team in general, your gonna need to be strong especially with football because you need to be strong to tackle people or to take hard tackles and your gonna need to run fast so your gonna need strong legs and your gonna need strong legs in basketball because when you need to jump you can jump high so you don't get blocked and strong arms to shove through people when you going for a drive to the basket, there are many things this club can help wit and it can really help your body stay in shape, so when you do play sports are not gonna be weak and easily get hurt or easily get taken down.

These and many other clubs can be very fun and is a way of learning new things, trying new things, and starting new hobbies for your future and doing these clubs especially help with being social and talk to others and when working together you learn to communicate and be a great team with friends and clubs can help you learn and be better at new things. Also, it can interest you into things for the future since at that point you are gonna be more skilled and more comfortable with what you are doing and you actually know what you are doing.

Lastly, clubs are great way to spend your free time like when you have nothing to do at home, so I agree with the principal that we should at least have one extracurricular activity because they can really help us in many ways of learning new things, trying new things, and choose what we really like and enjoy and you just might find out something you didn't know you could do.                          ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
AB115EA6CA38,"What if the principal at your school made it mandatory for every student to be involved in an extracurricular activity? If my principal did that I would be all for it. Having everyone do an extracurricular activity can lead to new friendships, can help people branch out, and it looks good on a college resume. I believe that if we had to paricipate in an activity outside of school it would improve the moods of students, increase healthy lifestyles, and help get rid of bullying.

Firstly, having students be a part of activities afterschool can help students branch out. Last yeat I was a new kid, and I didn't have many friends, until I joined the tennis team. Once I was a part of the tennis team I started to open up and be goofy and energetic. I started to be like my old self again. Joining an extracurricular activity can help others open up, just as it helped me.

Secondly, extracurricular activities look good on college resumes. colleges do want people who are intelligent and focused, but they also want people who know how to work well with others and are actively participating in school events. Getting involved in an extracurricular activity is a great way to show colleges that you are intelligent, focused, team orriented, school spirited, and so much more.

In addition to helping students branch out and improving college resumes, participating in afterschool activities can help lead you to new friendships. When I was on the student council I met lots of new people and grew closer to them as the year went on. My experience on the student council has taught me how to be kind to everyone I meet and it encouraged me to be bold and make new friends. When you participate in these extracurricular acticities your people skills elevate, making it easier for you to make new friends.

overall, what is the harm of students being a part of something bigger than themselves and spending time with other people that share the same interests? There is no reason that students should not be involved in extracurricular activities. These activites help students branch out, make new friends, and they look good on college resumes. Having every student be a part of an extracurricular activity, in my opinion, is an amazing idea. I hope you see that these activities could be a grand opportunity for you. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
2CCB36FFC40D,"I agree that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity, because it will get students active, you can socialize with your friends, and you can have fun!

Instead of staying at home all evening. Students can play sports, or stay after school to participate in educational, or non-educational activities, or clubs. You can join a Reading Olympics team, you can try out to play a sport, join an after school club, or maybe even create one. Instead of just staying at home all evening.

What if you didnt have the same classes with you friends? If you join an after school activity, you can have plenty of time to socialize with your friends. Maybe y'all could make your own club or activity that other students can join, so they can do the same with their friends.

Lastly, you can have a lot of fun. Hanging out with your friends, joining an activity about something you love to do. I dont see anything wrong with any of that. And if you cant participate one night, thats fine.

So yes, all students should participate in an extracurricular activity, whether it would be after school, or on the weekend.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
8252036912DC,"I agree with the principal for it making a requirement for all students to do at least one extracurricular activity. It can benefit a child's life in many ways. It is beneficial to a student's health, mentally and physically. Along the way they might meet new people, and learn how to be committed to a team or group. These may not only be useful in the present, but they may be useful in the future as well.

Doctors have done research to find what being in a physical activity, like a sport, can do to improve a person's health. They found that being physically active releases a chemical in the brain, that puts a person in a better mood. So not only will students be staying active, their mental state might be better than not doing an extracurricular activity. From experience, I know that when I'm at swim practice, it takes my mind off of everything else going on in my life. It tremendously relieves my stress, at least for the period of time that I'm at practice. If a student were to sign up for a club related to science, that would also exercise their mind or expand their knowledge, which could be useful for future jobs.

When I used to competitively dance, I met my friend Generic_Name. I've known her for many years and we are still very close friends to this day. Dancing with her made something that I already loved, even more exciting. I know fellow students would agree with me because my friend Generic_Name has a friend named Generic_Name that she knows from swim. They have been friends for years too, just like Generic_Name and me. In student council, I got put into a group with a girl named Generic_Name, and now we are best friends. So, I get to work with someone that I have a close relationship with.

When it comes to working in a group, people learn how to be reliable and committed. If a student were to join or be on a soccer team, they would not just go to practice whenever they feel like it. They would go even if they do not want to because their parents are most likely paying for it and they should not let their team down. Also, in student council, we have to always find away to contribute to a group, so if I say I am going to do something, I do it because my group is relying on me. Even when I do not feel like completing a task, I do it anyways. Not doing the necessary tasks is letting the whole group down and creating more work for others.

In conclusion, I believe the principal is doing the right thing by making it a requirement for all students to be involved in an extracurricular activity. It will make a positive change in each student's overall health. They may meet close friends in their group or team. Lastly, they will learn how to be reliable and committed to others. These benefits of doing an extracurricular activity will affect every student's life (positively) and their future friendships, jobs, and careers. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
0ADBB145FC2C,i disagree because some people dont like to do activities at school and they rather go home because some activities at school are boring and the people like to stay after are the ones with more active system and they like to stay for sports or learn more. people would like to see how fun it could be sometimes because staying after is not that bad you can stay at your favorite club and activity mines will be to pla y for soccer club and they could see how much fun it could some people would stay for other classes and be interested so they can bring there grades up and get goods grades on there report card. and some others will go to like a club or a technology room because they think it interesting the principal maybe wanted students to do something fun and not be bored at home the principal probably wants them to be a fun person for a day and give everybody a chance to join a club or activity and have fun and so they can meet other people and know about them so they wont be always talking to the same people sometimes people need to know other people so they can talk about each other and talk about how much they love the activities but in my opinion i want to disagree in the same time because some people dont like to stay after school because its boring and theres nothing fun to do so they just go home some people are just tired and exhausted and thats why some othere people cant even stay just to help there parents around the house or take care of there brother or sister but sometimes you just get bored and dont even want to stay at the school because they are tired of seeing the classes and the people or just even learning sometimes be like i want to stay but they never stay they just and other says i will stay this time and they dont stay but some people just dont like to see the school everyday they only come to learn and leave home but other people come and stay because they have nothing to do or they just bored in the house. so they just go to the after school activity so they wont be bored so they can just have fun.,2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
6D7FF613393A,"It is two forty-nine, and Generic_Name has to wait only one more minute for the school day to end. He was looking forward to having his first baseball practice of the fall later that night. The bell rings, and Generic_Name begins to cheer loudly.

""Generic_Name are you excited for science club today?"" said Generic_Name, Generic_Name's best friend. Generic_Name froze, and had remembered he had science club for two hours after school today. Generic_Name began panicking, and started asking himself questions.

""Am I going to be late for practice?"" ""Will I have time to finish my homework?"" Then Mr. Generic_Name, Generic_Name's last block teacher, began to pack up his things, getting ready to leave work for the day, before Generic_Name said, ""Mr. Generic_Name, why are you leaving, isn't there yearbook club today?"" Mr. Generic_Name let out a disappointed sigh and began to unpack all of his things. This is how life would be if all students had to participate in after school activities. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it won't provide students the time necessary to complete their homework to the best of their abilities, many students participate in sports outside of school, and teachers will have to spend more time after school directing clubs.

The first reason I disagree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities is because it won't provide students the time necessary to complete their homework to the best of their abilities. If a student participated in a club that extended their school day by two hours, that is two hours fewer that the student has to complete homework. There are some days where a student will receive homework for every subject, and if my principal took away my time do my homework, I would be furious. Also, when students don't have the time necessary to complete assignments to the best of their abilities, they race through it to complete it and risk earning a failing grade. If a student feels stressed and overwhelmed by their homework because of an after school club, they should have the choice to not participate in the club. Homework is practice for later assessments, and if the student does not have time to practice and prepare for the quiz or test, they will never learn what they need to and will not succeed on the assessment.

The second reason I disagree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities is because many students participate in sports outside of school. Some students play at a level where they are practicing several times a week. For example, if a middle school student has baseball practice at six o'clock, and their after school club ends at five, not only will they have to rush from school to practice, but may be at risk of being late. Coaches of competitive teams find it frustrating if their players are late to practice. A student can also become very exhausted from a long day at school and may not perform well with an exhausted body and mind. An athlete must also be dedicated to their sport outside of practices, which means working to get better after school. Student-athletes have to find a balance between their schoolwork and their sports, and this can be difficult if a club is being thrown into the mix as well.

The final reason I disagree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities is because teachers will have to spend more time after school directing clubs. Teachers spend hours a day grading papers outside of school, and some still struggle with completing this. The last thing a teacher wants to do is have a few hours of grading papers cut off their day so they can direct a club. If a teacher has an hour and a half less to grade papers, then that is a few hundred assignments left without a grade. These papers begin to add up, and before they know it, they have 5 stacks of assignments that are being graded at two in the morning. Not only will the teacher have to supervise the club, but they will also be tasked with planning what the members are doing at every meeting, on top of planning for what they are teaching their students throughout the normal day. A teacher is still a human, and can become stressed out by all this extra work they have to complete. All of this extra work for them takes away the valuable time they can be spending with their beloved families.

The bell rings, and Generic_Name goes soaring out of the door, to his locker, outside to the bike rack, and begins his peaceful bike ride home. He can not wait for baseball practice and to see all of his teammates again. As Generic_Name arrives home, his mom calls to him, ""I made you a smoothie, it's on the counter."" Generic_Name sits down and opens up his laptop, and begins working on his history presentation. When he was finished, he was sure that it was the best work he had ever done. A couple of hours later, Generic_Name arrives at practice, and is so enthusiastic to see his teammates. Generic_Name was thrilled to be back on the ball field! This is how a student would feel without the stress of having to participate in a club. They have time to actually perform well on homework and projects, and can enjoy their life as a kid. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it won't provide students the time necessary to complete their homework to the best of their abilities, many students participate in sports outside of school, and teachers will have to spend more time after school directing clubs.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
51D1B45542A1,"Hello my name is Generic_Name, my principle asked me my opinion on if every kid at school should join an extracurricular activity, such as a sport, a club, or scouts. But I don't think its a good idea. Some kids might not have time for that pointless activity they might have to get home fast and do chores or care for a loved one. It might be incunvenet for there family's too they might not be able to pick their kids up from the activity. Also, Most kids would be pretty mad to we are already in school for more than six hours out of the day.

Why I think its a bad idea is a very good question. Students at school can have fun for some kids but not all kids have fun at school some kids just put their heads down hoping the bell will ring sooner than it did yesterday. I think if those kids were forced to join an extracurricular activity they would be so miserable. They would proudly try to fake sick or always go to the to the nurse hoping to go home because they might be an introvert not liking crowds or human attention. Some kids might just want to go home to their families and or their pets.

Parents might get upset as well, they might not be able to go to the school and pick their kids up. This will make the kids sad and the parents a little mad. Then, parents might have to leave work early or hire some one to go pick the kids up and take them home. It would also not benefit the school ether parents would probably call the school constantly asking them to not make their kid go to the activity today and this would probably make the school uncomfortable with all the negative attention there getting.

Students who go to that school are probably be super grumpy, tired, and annoyed. They already go to school for over six hours a day adding more onto that is going to make them tired and mad. They are most likely just sleeping and not wanting to work on anything. Since they are sleeping in school it would cause them to not sleep at night then they are tired the next day. It is a terrible cycle of sleeping in school. And there still kids let them go home and have their free time.

So all of this has been leading up to why school should let kids make their own choices. Give the kids an option if they want to join an extracurricular activity or not. Schools should accept the students choice and let the kids be kids. No matter if they want to go home and watch TV, play video games, or just play sports with there families at home. Kids should be kids.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
34C40190E817,"Do you agree or disagree with everyone doing extracurricular activities after school? Well I agree with everyone doing extracurricular activities. The reason I agree with this statement is because doing extracurricular activities can help people make friends and become more social,it helps them become more active and improves their physical ability and it improves their ability to work with other people.

Doing extracurricular activities can help people make friends by working together. It helps them become more social,for instance by joining football or other programs they meet other people with the same interests and they can connect in and out of school. They also meet a lot of faces they haven't met before during school and if they're in the same program or club they can get know each other more. They can connect with people of different ages when they're in the program so they can learn something from someone older than them or teach something to the younger person to help them to the right path in life. Joining these programs or clubs helped me make a lot of friends and it taught me a lot of things such as what younger people are interested in or what they struggle in.

Doing extracurricular activities such as football or other physical sports helps them be more active or and it improves their physical ability and mental ability. Doing sports help students be more active by enhancing cardio and helping them try other sports. Such as everyday practice can help students make sure they get 2 hours of exercise every day so it helps themselves feel better and become better. It also helps their physical ability by doing drills and practicing everyday which will cause physical improvement to their body. The reason I say doing these activities help your mental ability is because it helped me improve my grades and behavior and pushed me to my very best and I feel great because doing these activities lead me out the hole I dug myself into.

It helps minors with the ability to work with other people and to helps everyone to learn to work as a team. Such as doing a sport helps them work with other people because a football team typically has more than 40 guys on the team. Studies at the University of Louisiana show that 67% of people that do these type of activities are more better at doing work with groups rather than work alone. Working together helps people build their skills and helps them to get used to working with big groups or any size group. As my father once said""team work,makes the dream work"".

Do you agree with everyone doing extracurricular activities? Yes I heavily agree with everyone doing extracurricular activities. Now you the reader knows why I agree because it helps people make friends and become social,it helps them become more active and improves their physical ability and it helps their ability to work with other people. Doing extracurricular activities helped me a lot and I hope it helps everyone that is planning to do a extracurricular activity in school.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
CA3BC65D287E,"I don't agree with the principal on this decision to force students to take an extracurricular activity because it isn't a good decision. Making students have to take an extracurricular activity isn't fair, and they could have other things they need or want to do besides taking an extracurricular activity. Teachers also have things they need or want to do after school but it wouldn't be fair that they have to cancel it because of having to watch the students after school in their activities. The hallways and classrooms would also be crowded with all the students having to stay after school for an extracurricular activity. With all the students in school longer the custodians would have to clean up messes the students make after school and that wouldn't be fair for them. This decision by the principal would be bad for most people in school, which is why I don't agree with it.

I mean, I can see that there are some positive things about this decision of taking an after school activity everyday like meeting new people or learning something new, but there are a lot more negatives I see from this decision than positives. One big reason I wouldn't agree with this is because students have lots of better things to be doing other than taking an extracurricular activity. Students have things they want to do when they leave school, but I don't think they would appreciate that they have to skip it because of a extracurricular activity they don't want to do. A student might also have an emergency somewhere else that they have to go to, but they can't get there because of the activity. Most students also have to do lots of homework when they get home, but they'll have to wait for the activity to end until they can even start it.

Another reason I don't agree with this decision is because there are lots of questions that make this a bad decision. One question about this decision that I have is ""how will students get home from that activity?"" because buses only come on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, so unless the the student finds a ride home or finds some other way to get home on Tuesdays and Fridays, they're stuck in school until they do. The teachers also would have to stay after school everyday to watch the students, so ""would the teachers get payed for being at school longer to monitor the students?"". Another question I'd ask about this decision is ""how much money will it cost to buy snacks everyday for all the students being forced to go to clubs everyday?"" because the cost of the snacks everyday for a lot of students sounds like it isn't cheap. One last question I'd ask is would ""extracurricular activities count as a class?"" because if you missed the extracurricular activity, would you have to remake what you missed if you were absent like a class? The fact that none of these questions have answers to them makes this decision very worrisome.

One last reason why I don't agree with this is because I honestly think that extracurricular activities are a waste of time and most things done in extracurricular activities can be done at home. I've went to some clubs in my time in 8th grade, but it seemed like a huge waste of time honestly. By the time the clubs start most people would be home by now so you could've just went home instead of waiting for the club to start. Waiting for the bus when leaving the club also takes a long time, and adding the time it takes up to wait for the club to start is about 30-45 minutes, which could've been used on more important things. One bag of chips or some other snack also was barely anything for me because lunch was 3-4 hours ago, and I'm hungry for a meal, not some small snack. What also made me disappointed was that the clubs aren't even that long, and the only thing that made them long was waiting for the club to start and waiting for the buses to arrive so we could leave. The only clubs I really see benefits from are things like workout club or computer refurbishing but those take a lot of effort and aren't really that enjoyable. Overall, a club isn't so great and lots of time is wasted from clubs, so I don't think that the principal should make the decision for it to be required to take one everyday.

In conclusion, I don't agree with this decision, but there are lots things that could be improved from this decision to make it better for everyone, like making more variety of clubs so that there isn't a little selection of after school clubs would be a good idea. Another good suggestion would be to make a good reason why they should join and make it it more enjoyable, so they want to join instead of making them forced to join. Although if a student doesn't want to participate in an after school club, then the principal shouldn't force them to do it. There are many more good suggestions but overall, I hope that this convinced the principal to not make this decision, and if he/she does make the decision, then at least improve it with some of my negatives about clubs and fix them.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
A489B73A1C59,"A recent study shows that individuals who participated in extracurricular activities as a child are more successful in life than those who did not take part in a sport or activity. This is most likely because of the important life skills and lessons that are taught through these activities. I think that all students at my school should be required to take at least one extracurricular activity in order to learn about commitment, work together with classmates, and discover what their interests are for future careers.

Speaking from experience, I can honestly say that activities such as sports, student council, and yearbook can all contribute to creating better commitment and time management skills. Students who choose to take part in activities outside of school must learn how to balance their homework along with their commitments. School prepares children for the future, and this important time management lesson would be crucial in every student's adult life. Along with time management, commitment is also a necessary lesson to be taught at a young age. For example, athletes are warned to never miss a practice unless it is absolutely necessary. They have committed to the team, therefore, they attend every practice and work hard to better themselves. Because of this, they develop character. Athletes who show up to practice on time every day are learning how their life will be when they become adults and must be punctual and prepared for whichever occupation they choose.

Extracurricular activities are incredible ways to understand what it's like to work as a team and to be a leader. Students that serve on the Student Council are all taking part in leading their fellow classmates. Along with leading their school, Student Council members also have to know how to work together and complete tasks in order for our school to function properly. Cooperation and teamwork are essential things to practice because when students grow up, they won't always get the chance to lead. Sometimes, it's better to step down and let someone that is more qualified take control, and without extracurricular activities, students would never learn when or how to do this. Teamwork and leadership might seem like complete opposites, but in reality, they go hand in hand. Students don't normally get many opportunities throughout the school day to practice leading or working together, so required activities would be a great way to enforce these skills.

The final reason that our school should require extracurricular activities is because they assist students in figuring out what interests them. For example, if a student decides they will take a yearbook class in order to complete their required activity, they might discover a love of journalism that they never knew they had. Or on the other hand, they might decide that writing is just not for them and that they want to try something else. Regardless, these activities are helping students figure out what they're good at and making them better at their passion. Personally, I think this school should have a multitude of opportunities for students to figure out what they are truly passionate about and help them consider their future career.

In addition to these main benefits, there is a large amount of other lessons that students could potentially take away from extracurricular activities. Not only do they gain life skills and develop character, but they also gain a couple of new friends that will continue to help them grow throughout their life. In order to gather these essential life lessons and skills, students at my school should be required to take at least one extracurricular activity. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

10E592ECBDB0,"Have you ever just gotten home from school and had nothing to do, most likely became bored very quickly. This is may be because you don't participate in any after-school activities. These activities can range from yearbook to sports in or out of school. All students should be involved with extracurricular activities because they're most likely to become more involved with their school, it gives them a chance to be more social, and they get to be more active after school.

Students that are doing extracurricular activities tend to become more involved with their school. Being in these activities gives them a chance to get to know the people in their learning environment. Studies have show that every student who gets into activities are performing better in school and receive better grades. When I got involved with extracurricular activities I felt more welcome in my school environment because I could recognize more faces around me. So I'm assuming that other students would feel this way too once they join an after school activity.

When joining an after school activity you get a chance to meet more people and make new friends. Students that have joined activities are more willing to talk in class and ultimately become more confident. It feels better when you know more people at or around your school. Extracurricular activities give you a chance to be more social. Which is good for you, allowing you to express yourself in ways that you might not have felt comfortable doing before because you didn't know anyone around you.

Each after-school activity is different but most allow students to be active. This is great for kids who have a lot of energy but can't get it out during the school day. We all know most schools have kids sit around all day but according to specialists this isn't good for development because it doesn't allow students who learn better when using their hands or moving around get that chance. Which is okay because some activities let the students move around whilst learning. Of course there are extracurricular activities such as sports that allow these students to play and run after school as well.

Some people may think that extracurricular activities aren't necessary for all children but that isn't the case. There is a wide variety of activities that can fit any persons interests, whether they enjoy chess or track and field. So I want you to make a difference in your school and join an after school activity it may be fun, you might make new friends, or get more involved in or around your school.

F814820E2B45,"65% of all public school students participate in extracurricular (after-school) activities. The principle of Generic_School has decided that every student attending Generic_School must participate in an extracurricular activity. In this prompt, I will be explaining the pros and cons extracurricular activities have on students, and whether or not I agree with the principle's decision. I will first be explaining the pros and cons that extracurricular activities have on students.

There are many good benefits that extracurricular activities have on students. For example, when students participate in these after-school activities, they are able to spend more time out of the house. Sometimes kids don't want to spend all of their freetime in their house, and if they do an after-school activity, they will be able to keep themselves busy. Another good benefit that after-school activities have on students, is that you have an opportunity to meet new people. One more good benefit that extracurricular activities have on students, is that may have more fun than if you just go home and watch tv everyday. These are some of the many pros that after-schol activities have on students. There are many good benefits that extracurricular activities have on students, but now, I am going to talk about some of the cons that come with it.

There are many downfalls that after-school activities have on students. For example, sometimes students are tired, and are having a bad day, and then, they have to go to practice when they don't want to. Students should not have to worry about having to go to their after-school activity if they don't want to. Another downfall that extracurricular activities have on students, is that they may persuade you to make bad choices. For example, if you have football practice, but you have a bunch of homework you need to do, this may influence you to make bad choice, such as cheating. One more downfall that extracurricular activities have on students, is that some students may have trouble getting a ride when their after-school activity is over. If students ride the bus to, and from school, they may have no way to get home from school after their after-school activityis over. Now that I have listed the pros and cons of how students can be affected by after-school activities, I will conclude this prompt.

Listing the pros and cons that extracurricular activities have on students has helped me decide that in the end, students should be able to choose whether or not they join an after-school activity. I chose this decision because I think that some students are able to handle doing after-school activities while keeping their grades up in school. If we forced all students to participate in these activities, I believe that it would be better than forcing them to participate in something they might not want to be apart of.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
3CF52C3ED074,"All students do is waste their time and i'm tired of it. Students complain that school is like a prison but that is only because they don't realize the fun part of school. I agree with the principal that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students are too lazy instead of wasting time they should participate in after school activities. For students it could benefit a lot, give kids good memories, and make school more fun.

My first reason is, It could benefit a lot. Doing extracurricular activity can give an idea of what you want to do in the future. Sports is a very popular career choice for students but sports takes skills maybe sports could be your future. If your not very athletic thats ok many people enjoy debate club many politicians debate and if that is your skill maybe that can be your career. These after school activities can even help you learn about yourself. Make sure to participate in something you enjoy or try something you never done before. the best part about learning about yourself is finding your hidden talent in any type of activities.

My next reasoning is, giving kids good memory's. In competitions there is always a reward, and good remember able thing is achieving that reward for your team and school. The highest achievement to accomplish is winning a tournament with your team. Even if you dont win at least you made it to the the finals. The most important part about extracurricular activity is having a fun time. No matter how popular you are you dont know everyone so get to know your teammates and make new friends. From my experience I played basketball and it was a really fun time but i'll never forget when i scored my first point. I promise you things are a lot more memorable when you do something exciting. Everyday you learn something new which can help you get better at what you activity you enjoy to do, and get to know your aquantince.

My last reasoning is, it would make school way more fun. Tell your friends and family what you did today. share with them your achievements, And what made your day. Make coming to more exciting. come to school prepared for after school activities. Now this might seem like too much pressure, but bring your school a trophy!

In conclusion, i strongly agree with the principal decision that all students participate. Our school has a lot of activities that will interest all students. School goes by really fast so at least make the most of your years here. Because students are too lazy instead i believe all students should participate in after school activities. It would be beneficial for students, give students something to remember, and enjoy school more.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
801DA1EF0C47,"Have you ever felt like going home because you had a bad day? Going home laying there eating your favorite ice cream and watching your favorite TV show. Well thats a reality for most students. Taking our freedom away without asking us is unacceptable. By making it mandatory for students to stay after school for at least one day,the principle is creating problems that the student will have to deal with. This will make students lose a day of work, be penalized for not staying after school, and add on to the students and teachers responsibilities.

My first point of why we should not make it compulsory to stay after school is because of the decreased work time. By making us stay after school we will have a shortened time on completing our assignment and projects. This can result in student grade drops which can cause them to lose their A or B and in dire situations get a D or F. A grade drop by one or two letters can cause stress on to students and students with medical conditions can be greatly effected from stress related problems. These problems will create complications to student health and grades.

My second point is that the staff will have to consider multiple factors that influence whether a student can attend an extracurricular activity.

They will have to organize a system to see if a student stayed for after school and if not why did they not unless the student has already stayed for one day. Then they would have to call the students parents to determine why the student could not stay. The individual who will be assigned to that job will have to do the same tedious process for all the students who did not attend. The entire ordeal can be avoided by not making students stay for the program and by allowing them to determine whether or not to go.

My final point is that students should not be obligated to stay at school longer than 8 hours. We should have the choice to stay for extracurricular activities. The students want to enjoy their time. School should not be a burden on students. It should be your escape from the outside world. Your way out. The decision to make student participate should not be forced on the student, but made by the student. The principle did not consider that the students should also have the right to choose with what happens with their free time.

In conclusion, the students should not be forced to stay after school and be allowed to choose. The problems that occur are unnecessary and stressful for the students and teachers alike. The students will have more time to fulfill their school work, personal work, and maintain time for their personal activities. Thus avoiding stress from the extracurricular program and from grade drops. This will benefit the school, students, and the teachers showing more reason for why I disagree with this decision.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
429F4E63967A,"Do you want to have extra activities in school to make you more tired and grumpy? NO! You shouldn't have a extra activity if you're not willing to do it. I have 3 reasons why you shouldn't take a extra activity. Doing an extracurricular activity is horrible because, you may have family to go home and take care of, you might have a after school job to attend and; finally, you may have to babysit your siblings.

Your whole family is depending on you to come home everyday and care for them, you cannot be wasting your time on what the principle says. Your mother may be sick or your father could be dyeing from a illness that no one knows about. Your time can't be wasted by an activity you're not wanting to do. If they try and try to make you do something you are not wanting to do then say, "" No, I have my family that I love and care about passionately, I have no time to do an activity I'm not wiling to do."" Extra activities take up way to much time; although, it may be helpful you still have to think to yourself and say, "" I have more important tasks to do.""

Would you rather work a job and get paid or, do a sport and waste precious time taking all your energy? You can work at Subway, Chick-Fil-A, and at a Burger King. Do you really want to participate in a sport or an activity? A job lets you meet new incredible people, help take care of responsibilities, and get more cash. You can't get that from doing a extra activity all you're doing is what your school or principle wants. Working at a job can also, provide you a lot of currency from doing what they need, you also have to think to yourself, "" Can I really live in this world without money.""

You're the oldest in your family and; although, you hate watching your siblings, mom still wants you to do it. You can't say no to your mother, you have to say no to your principle, he or she is incorrect. You shouldn't be made to do a extracurricular activity ever, especially if you're made to participate in it. Your teachers, principles, nor peers know what is going on at home so, they cannot make you do anything you are not willing to do. Your siblings may be in elementary school, middle school, or even high school but you still have to give them care and protect them when your parents aren't around.

In conclusion, you now know why you have the right to say, no. You should use your time wisely by, taking care of your families, having a after school job, or babysitting your siblings. There are more tasks to do in this world then to do everything that the schools want you to accomplish so you have to stand up for yourself.

When you head back to school on Monday go to your principle and say, "" I have better and more caring things to deal about."" You may get into trouble, but you fought your will and you made the right and important decisions. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
1D994E88DBB6,"The principal wants all the students to paeticipate. In some type of extra activity after school. Such as sports,student council,or the yearbook. Three reasons i agree are that because one , it keeps kids out of trouble, two it could bring alot of people together, three its more healthy for the kids mentally and physically.

One reason i agree with the students doing extra activities is. That it keeps the kids out of trouble. What i mean by trouble is like, some kids may live in bad environments. Which might cause them to stay in trouble with the police all the time. So that is why i think it could help them stay out of trouble. When it comes to extra activities.

A second reason i agree with students doing extra activities is. That it brings alot of people together. What i mean by it brings people together is. That people who may be shy or not so outgoing,could break out of that shell of not. Talking to people as much as they would like to .So that is why i think it brings people together.

The third reason i agree with kids doing extra activities is. That its more healthy for the kids mentally and physically because. When they are around people doing positive things on a daily. It improves peoples performance school wise and social wise. So that is why i think it would be healthy for them mentally and physically.

The principal thinks that students doing extra activities would be a good idea. Everyone has different opinions about it. But three reasons i agree with students doing extra activities are one it keeps them out of trouble, two it brings alot of people together and three its healthy for them mentally and physically. So that is why extra activities is a good idea for students to do.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
3C58C11EE58B,"Schools around the country are trying to find a better way to get kids occupied. So they came up with clubs and extracurricular acitivites to persuede them join. But some students do not find them very interesting, and would rather stay at home and do nothing but be on the internet the entire time. So what if your principal said that all students had to join at least one extracurricular activity? Would you agree with his choice, and be happy about it, or would you disagree with his choice, and be dissapointed? I agree with his choice because I think it is a great way to get students to connect with others, explore new options, and to keep them busy. I think it is a fabulous idea that they are making the students join more clubs, and keeping them occupied, so they don't have to stay at home and be around the internet and social media all the time.

One reason why I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because they can connect with others. I think it is a excelent way to meet new people and build new friendships and bonds. If I just joined a new club, and I didn't know a lot of people, I would take it as a great opprotunity to meet new people, and learn more about them. I think one way people become close is because of these clubs because they get to see more of the person and share the same similarities and connections as them. These students also get to spend more time and interact with other people, which I think brings students closer. This is why these activites can help students to connect with others.

Another reason why I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because they can explore more. This opprotunity that the principal is giving them is allowing them to try something new, and find their passion and what they love. Students might try something new and then find out that they really enjoy it. This is a great way to get students to find the things that bring them joy, and that gets them motivated. They can also learn a lot from the experience and it can dig them deeper into learning more about it. Even if the student doesn't like it, they now know that it wasn't the club for them, and it reminds them that they should try something different. That is what exploring is all about! This is why extracurricular activites can lead students to finding what they love.

The last reason why I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because it keeps them busy. These students will never be bored, and will get kids to work with others, and participate in activities. The clubs will keep them occipied and not at home as much. Even though these activities will take away time from family, it will be better for these students to learn more than to be at home on the internet and social media. I think it is a fun way to get out of their bedrooms and have a little fun outside of the house. Making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity is a fantastic way to occupie students.

Having clubs and activites is a great way to power students into learning more about themselves. They can explore new hobbies, and meet new people, and I think it is just an awesome way to motivate students. Being able to have the chance to participate in what you love is so fortunate and I think these students should take it for granted. I always loved to explore more about me a find out who I really am, and I think if I join a club or activity, I can find that. I want students to learn from this that if they try and put effort into something, then they will begin to enjoy that, and it will be better for them. This is why I think students should join at least one exracurricular activity for their own good.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
0552EE171A0A,"I agree with the principal that all students should at least have one extracurricular activity .What activities do you like ?

There are plenty of extracurricular activity's you could do along with reasons why you should do at least one activity. It can help out with exercise and staying healthy ,getting things off your mind and having fun. There are plenty of activity's you could do that you could like.

Reason one is there's activities that can help you exercise and stay healthy like soccer,football,basketball and more .You could get more into them and play them while having fun .Example before you play soccer or any other sports you exercise first to be stretched out. In that way you can stay healthy.

Also having fun if you have nothing to do you can do fun activities like working on the school yearbook and helping out in community service .And in sports you can have fun to by meeting new people that like the same activity as you. Having fun in stuff you love. Example you can have fun by spending time with your friends and activities you guys love .

Last activities can help you get you things off your mind and focusing on yourself .You can have so many things on your mind like family problems ,tests,school activities can be a way of getting things off your mind you could do boxing to release anger and stress .And bring out the fun in you .

In my conclusion you should do at least one activity to be productive and be able to stay healthy ,get things off your mind while having fun . I know theres other stuff you need to complete but you can make time for an activity.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
7FB02EF0CF58,"There are some students that would enjoy extracurricular activities, and some students that will despise it. Some students might like different activities then the other, but would extracurricular activities really benefit the students lifestyle?

I agree and disagree with the principals decision. First, I agree with this decision because, if students are interested on a extracurricular activity, then I think that they should totally do it. When a student joins a school club, a sport after school, or do service hours, they will be able to have an experience on what it's like. Also, they would be able to make more friends and would be more active and social to others. If the student is some what shy or is trying out something new, then they can open up with others and would try to be comfortable with the environment and the way they cope.

I also disagree with the principals decision. First, some students would not have the time to be able to join an extracurricular activity because they can either be working on homework, or they have something important they have to do after school. Also, some parents would also not have the time to pick their kids up from the after school activity. Especially high school and college students would not have the time to join an extracurricular activity because, most high school and college students have to work right after school and maybe some students might have tutoring after school too. If the high school or college student joins an extracurricular activity, then they would most likely not have time to work after school.

Parents may not have the money to put their child into an extracurricular activity. First, some after school clubs you need to be payed for, like theater and most sports. Most parents can't afford to pay a certain amount of money to put their child in a after school activity. Parents need to provide money to pay their rent, electricity and water bills. High school and college students are starting to buy things with their own money that they work for, and some students wouldn't be able to pay for an after school program.

In conclusion, I think that is really depends on how your family copes with it and your schedule. Most students will have the time for extracurricular activities and others don't have the time to. This is why I think that It depends on the students schedule.          ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
D32FE4646A6A,"Would you appreciate being forced to do an extracurricular activity even though you never intended on participating in one?

I think most people wouldn't appreciate that so thats why I disagree with what the principal says, because some students don't have time for after school activities or the student is shy and doesn't really want to be forced to talk to their peers .

While I understand that many people do like after school activities because you can meet new people and become more familiar with your peers.

This could be an okay solution for some people but some people are shy and don't want to be forced into activities.

This many lead to depression and loneliness which is why I disagree with the principal of the school.

There are many reasons why extracurricular activities shouldn't be forced upon a student, but we are only talking about two.

The first reason is that students just don't have time after school.

Many students out of school participate in sport activities or they help in their neighborhood.

These activities take up a lot of time on their own and most likely tire the students out.

Now imagine adding another activity they have to do before all their other requirements.

The students would be tired after their first activity, but then they would have to go to their other activities which would make them so exhausted after they might not get a good nights sleep.

Which is hurting the school because if the students don't get a good nights sleep they won't be able to pay attention in class and many of them would fail tests and even whole classes.

All this stuff is bad enough and we are only on reason one.

The second reason talks about people who are shy and can't talk to people well.

A lot of people around the world are very shy and antisocial and find it hard to connect with other people.

While many people believe if you make someone who is shy hang out with other people they will make friends or become better talking with their peers.

In some cases it might help the person but in many scenarios if you make a shy person hang out with others against their will they might get anxiety or feel more lonely watching their peers talking to each other while they are just watching.

All of this could lead to depression which would make them feel useless and they would most likely start failing in school.

Now that both the reasons are complete and there's a good understanding of why I disagreed with the principal.

What would you have done if you were a student at this school and you weren't very athletic and you weren't the best at extracurricular activities, but you were forced to participate in something you don't want to do?

I think many people would be angry and say that is goes against their rights. I believe that everyone should have a choice and that they shouldn't let some tell them what to do.

Everyone is different and shouldn't be told what to do, because many people like many different activities.

I believe many people would agree with me and say that they disagree with the principal and what they are saying.

the real question is do you agree or disagree.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
38C5C8A4C583,"Imagine being required to stay in an area for an extended period of time while doing an activity you don't enjoy. That's a large amount of students who could feel this way while engaging in an extracurricular activity. Some people would like to use their time according to their agenda. Students shouldn't have to be required to participate in after school activities because they need to decide how to spend time. Additionally, reasons could include, finishing homework, disliking activities, or wanting to go home.

Finishing homework could be a major factor in why students would not like to attend after school programs. Because students often get large quantities of homework, they may want to finish it before participating in extracurricular activities so they don't have to worry about missing or unfinished assignments. Specifically, if a student wants to get their homework done, the programs would shorten the amount of time to finish their homework. This could also increase the stress put on a student from not having enough time to complete their work. Some students may not want to engage in extracurricular activities simply because they don't have the time to finish all assignments afterwards.

Another reason why people may not want to participate in after school programs could be that it does not seem enjoyable to them. It is unreasonable to do something you do not like because you could end up seemingly wasting your time for a grade. Adding on, some individuals may already be enrolled in other programs, they essentially would have to do multiple activities that can easily use their precious time. A handful of kids could also prefer to engage in a non related school event. Perhaps it'd be a tradition for a culture or activities that the school does not offer.

Lastly, a large amount of people just want to go home. Everyone needs to spend some time alone at some point. It is justifiable for students wanting to go home due to them not being able to relax in a school environment. People wouldn't be able to go to work and relax as if they would at home. It is also fact that kids would like to go home because they cannot stay in an area they don't want to be in. An example would consist of; someone staying at their work place for an extended period of time. Everyone wants to go home at some point for various reasons.

While extracurricular activities may be beneficial for a students health, many would not want to participate for lots of reasons. Students shouldn't have to do an after school program because it reduces the amount of time they have to finish an assignment, which could cause stress. Some people may also dislike the activities the school offers, while others could already be in a program outside of school grounds. Overall, many kids just want to go home after school and not do extra work. It is inappropriate for people to relax at school like they would at home. Therefore, students shouldn't have to participate in after school events because they need to decide how they want to spend their own time. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
606B03D848FB,"After school activities are a must, they really are. They can and will change your life in a heartbeat. Instead of sitting at your house eating chips and being lazy, so I think everybody should try to be in some sort of after school activities to get to know people, learn, and most importantly to have fun.

Getting to know your pears is important. If there was an emergency and you needed help it could help your classmates know what to do, to help calm you down possibly. Friendships can help you constantly when your feeling down, left out, and when you think that no one person in the world cares to help you they, your friends,will bring you back up to where they know the real you.

After school activities help you learn sports, tricks, and technology there is always something to learn from them. Down, set, hike this is the sound of a quarterback,that has memorized so many plays to keep track of, it takes so much mental work that it can't just take one day to be good at the position it takes time months, sometimes years to be educated enough. Depending on the after school activity that you choose, it could make a way to be your job someday.

Being good at the activity is only half of it. The other half is having a fun time, if you don't have a fun time whats the point in you doing the activity, maybe you should try a different activity. Find the thing that makes you want to smile and persue that into your activity.

You can have a fun time learning your activity with your friends all at the same time. Once again folks everybody should try to be in some sort of after school activities to get to know people, learn, and most importantly to have fun.

0B64C3347CCA,"I agree that all students should join at least one extracurricular activity because students could find out what they want to do when they get older by being in clubs that interest them and being in at least one club can also teach kids life skills and life lessons that can help them later on in their life(s). There can be a handful of benefits of being in just one (or more) extracurricular activity.

One main reason why joining a extracurricular activity is good is that kids can find out their interests if they haven't already. Most people don't figure out what they like or want to do until they finish high school or even later on. And what you want to be could change from time to time, but finding out what you like the most can have a good impact because when you like something you may or may not be good at it so doing if for a long time would help you improve. A person can have more then one interest which is perfectly fine because one can do both interests, such as if a person wants to be therapist but also wants to be a painter that person can be a therapist but in their free time can paint. Some families want their child to do what they like to do, but everyone should get to do what they are interested in.

Another important reason is that kids can learn life lessons/life skills. There are many clubs that can teach you these things such as debate club, serving on the student council, and sports can teach you about being active. There are a lot of things that a person has to face in life and sometimes you will not be prepared and that's okay, but it would be good if you have dealt with a situation like that so you will not be stuck. Being in a debate club, people respectfully agree about a situation which can help in the long run. By serving on the student council you learn about leadership, making hard decisions and sometimes doing things that you may not like that other people like to do.

Learning about life lessons/skills and finding out your interests could be a big help in life later on and can have many benefits to school, college, work, and many other things that come in a person's life. Just liking what you do even if you are not the best at it, would make most people happy. Just joining one club could help a person later on in life and that person will most likely be happy and enjoy what they do for a living.                  ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A1CDD5F607CF,"Take a moment to imagine what it would be like to know what the people around you are interested in. Wouldn't it be nice to know a lot of them held similar interests in comparison to you? Studies show that friendships tend to last longer when you're around people who like things that you like. I believe that the principal's decision to have all of the students participate in an extracurricular activity would be a good idea because it can help students learn to organize their time, help them find people with similar interests to make friends, and it could physically, and mentally, strengthen the students.

In order for one to survive as an adult, you must learn to organize your time. When doing extracurricular activities, because it is outside of school (most of the time) it is helpful to know when you have things planned. This way, a student could get work done for school, go to baseball practice, and still have time to go shopping with their friends. As an adult, you must schedule meetings, or interviews for jobs. Doing extracurricular activities would be great for the students; After all, it could help them learn to organize time for the future.

However, time isn't the most important subject when it comes to these activities. I believe that doing extracurricular activities would help students find their ""people"". I personally have done multiple sports, and currently have many interests such as, band, art, and swim. I have found that within these interests, I have made more friends than I could have if I didn't express them. I have held onto more relationships that date back to when we met in something that we liked, rather than something we didn't. Your ""people"" could also end up leaning you in the direction of different jobs. They could help you find things that you like, because they like the same things.

Finally, I believe that it could physically, and mentally strengthen the students who participate in such activities. When doing sports, I can confirm that you will most definitely become more physically able if you happen to like the sport. If you'd prefer to work in a group, by doing things such as band, yearbook, or student council, colleges might look to accepting you because you have the mental stability to work in a group. This could help the students with in-school activities such as projects.

I believe that the principal's decision to have all of the students participate in an extracurricular activity would be good because it can help students learn to organize their time, find people with similar interests to make friends, and it could physically, and mentally, strengthen the students. All of these points could help the students in the future, whether the points are seen as good or bad. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
70D7DD568DA6,"I disagree because people shouldn't be forced to do community services if they don't wanna do it. The students that do community services are helping out the environment and their also helping others to. One year I did community services and I really wasn't that interested in it. I found that community serices is boring unless you find something to do that you really like. People should have the right to do what they want to do no matter what. people shouldn't be forced to do something that they are not interested in at all.

Some students are very busy to with their families and other activities and sports that they don't even have time to help out in community services. It's not fair for those that are very busy and that have to do other things because their wasting their time on something that is not that important to them, when they could be using their time doing something that would really help them. If the principal wanted the community services to be due at a specific time and the student is really busy or has something else to do, the student can't be forced to do something they don't have time for.

I don't think I would be good at community services because I have a lot of things to do now that I'm in middle school almost going in to high school. In elementary school I would have time to do community services, because I didn't have as much homework and I had a lot of free time I could be spending my time on doing community services and helping out the environment. In elementary school we were forced to do community services, because they wanted us to help out the environment. I didn't like it because it was very boring in my opinon and wasn't gonna make me better at anything.

I would be ok if the principal made us do community services but, I would want it to be on the times were I am free and don't have anything to do. I would like community services to not have a time limit so that I'm not rushed to get activities done at a specific time. If the principal let the students do their activity all year long they would have a lot of time to do their activity.

If I had to do community services, I would probably play basketbal becuase thats my favorite sport. Basketball has always been my sport sense I was a little kid and I'm very good at basketball to. I would help the people that are not very good a basketball to help them get better at it. I would do a lot of drills and activities with those who need help learning how to play basketball.

E84B37C0DC10,"Think about your future, for example your dream collage. Don't you think that they would love see different activities you have done during your past year. To see if you are type of person they want to be at their school. I agree that participating in an extracurricular activity is a good detection to make .

I believe extracurricular activity can help them get into a good college. First doing a sport can help. Colleges love to see really good students you are dedicated to a certain sport. Which they would love for them to join their school cause of how good of a player they are. Secondly voluteering is another good reason. Colleges love to see when kids take the time out of their day to help those in need. Therefore if they take an activity involving voluteering it can help them get into the college they prefer. Lastly taking a student council or being a leader in some activity. Colleges have to determined if you are right for the college. Taking an activity that shows your leadership and hard working are amazing traits to be shown in a person. Sports, volunteering, showing leadership are the reasons why I think it is great for college applications.

Its a great way for you to interact. You could make new friends. Firstly when you participate in activity it is a great way to meet new people and become friends with someone who share the same interest. Secondly you are able to learn new things. Whatever activity you participate in, you would mostly learn something new. Therefore it could help you in the near future . Lastly it can change you as a person. When you are around new people and you learn their differences , you could change as a person and see the beauty between other. Making new friends , learning something new , and changing you as a person are reasons why extracurricular activities are great for interacting.

I agree that students should take extracurricular activities. It being great for college and great way of interacting are the reasons why I think so. Taking the time out of your day and doing something new can never hurt anyone.                  ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
9756E31C449F,"Imagine sitting on your fluffy, brown couch, thinking of what you could do if you signed up for the drama club, band, or even strings. You look at all your friends posts about how fun yearbook club was when you weren't even there. How would you feel? After school activities can do a lot for you. I've always enjoyed them even though it's extra hours at school. In my opinion, you should choose at least one extracurricular activity to do after school. After school activities will prevent laziness, bring happiness into going to school, and it may even help you become more social.

After school activities prevent laziness from students. When you actually have something to do after school, you are out running about, having fun, and you aren't even thinking about sitting on your phone, eating all the chocolate covered pretzels in the world. Knowing myself, all I want to do when I get home is eat, and of course, sleep. Being lazy leads to weight gain. Many students my age care about how they look to others. You have to be ""skinny"" to ""fit in"" or ""thick"" for boys to like you. It's always good to stay in shape and after school activities may help you with that. Doing what you love makes you more energized. Most clubs have fundraisers you can volunteer for and contribute too. You can stay up at night planning about it, making up cool ideas that'll keep you awake. Overall, no student should just sit at home, doing nothing but eating, if they have a choice to join a club.

All students wish they were happy going to school. Hanging out with friends for an extra amount of time is always the best part about after school clubs. When you might not have classes with a certain friend, it is always a good thing to see them if you have an after school activity with them. The friendship won't fade if you still get to talk to them for even just an hour a day. Sharing what you do after school makes you feel like you are apart of something. I always like sharing my stories about my track meets, practices, and pretty much everything. It's exciting to share stories to your friends instead of saying, ""oh, I don't do anything after school."" You should be happy about seeing the process you made for the school environment. If you end up in the gardening club or even a Junior Honors Society type club, you help make the front of your schools plants look pretty. People will most likely compliment you daily about how it looks and it'll make you very happy. Don't you want people complimenting your work? Lastly, not being in clubs wont make you happy going to school because you have nothing to look forward too. You could've chose between 100 or more clubs to join, but you didn't so you regret it.

Being social helps with the experience of a club. You can't enjoy clubs if you don't talk to anyone. Clubs are meant to be fun and meant for everyone to have a good time. If you don't talk to people and socialize even a little bit, they aren't going to speak to you first. I see why some students will disagree with my opinion on extracurricular activities because some people do have things going on in their life. I understand that some people are really shy, but its always good to step out of your comfort zone. Overall though, it is hard to talk to people when you aren't the type of person too. Being social teaches you great life skills for the future. You can't avoid not talking to people the rest of your life because you have to eventually get somewhere financially or even physically. Last but not least, I think social skills are the most important things you have to learn if you want to do an after school club, because you cannot enjoy it if you don't talk to anyone.

In conclusion, I agree with the principle on the students choosing at least one extracurricular, after school activity. It'll prevent laziness upon students, bring a happier environment for those going to school, and it'll help with social skills for shy students. No child or student at school wants to be body shamed or bullied for being overweight, too shy, or depressed. So, Generic_Name, in my opinion, I think it's a great idea for the students to have one extracurricular activity.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
13B3514D9E55,"I think extracurricular activities can be very beneficial to some kids. There is so much you can learn. When participating in an extracurricular, you can really enjoy yourself and have fun, get to experience new experiences, and they can help you get something thats stressing you off your mind.

You can have so much fun being involved in an extracurricular activity. There are so many different choices to choose from. You can choose things such as sports, arts, or just something fun for a class with a teacher. They are all fun options and you can do all of them if you would like or if you have time. It can also help you meet new friends with the same interests. Maybe there's a girl or boy that you didn't think you had anything in common with but now y'all participate in the same extracurricular. They have many different benefits. If you stay after for things like sports then that can help you become more active or if you stay after for arts, then you can learn many different things like taking pictures or playing with clay.

Extracurricular activities can help you get out of your comfort zone. Maybe you might make new friends or even a new friend group. There are so many different possibilities. Sometimes people worry too much about school and don't have time for fun things. I think that the activities will help. It's okay to give yourself some free time. Many people don't get to try new stuff. Some people get scared to play a sport because they think people will judge them. People shouldn't be able to control what you want to do. Even if your not good at that sport then just play it for fun. Don't play competitively but play for yourself. And if people don't think that you can do it, prove them wrong. If you don't think you can do something then try it out to see because sometimes we doubt ourselves. I think people should be able to do whatever they want and get to try new things because sometimes you find something you really like.

I also think that they can be very good because they may help you stop stressing about something that has been on your mind. If you do a sport, then you will be way too busy exercising to even think about anything else. When your being active nothing else should be going on in your head other than the sport you're playing. If you do arts, then you're gonna have way too much time having fun and not worry about what else is going on in the world. In art you want to have tons of focus to make something pretty. You don't want to just rush and make something bad or ugly. If you do something that your really enjoying, then I don't think you will be able to stress about anything that's happening in your life. It really takes your mind off stuff and many people, including students with tons of stress, need that. It's good to take some ""me"" time once in a while and do an activity that you will enjoy.

I think every student should do one extracurricular activity after school. Sometimes students have too much work going on at school and another activity is not what they want but maybe it's what they need. If you keep stressing that you have too much more than you have no motivation to actually do it. Maybe an extracurricular that you really enjoy can be that motivation. Extracurricular activities have many different benefits for many different people. Students and teachers can really benefit from them. Extracurricular activities should be something that everyone can enjoy.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
F32618051327,"Imagine this, you're a 9th grade freshman in high school and you just moved to Generic_City from Generic_City. All of your old friends at home missing you and since everyone at your new school has their own friends, making new ones is hard. If you were in an extracurricular activity such as a sport, yearbook club, or student council, then maybe making new friends wouldn't be as hard. The principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. This is a marvelous idea because it could keep students out of trouble, it would keep them from being on their phone so much, and they could make new friends.

When the school bell rings and all the kids are free to go home, some kids get bored and don't know what to do. Some get so bored they get into mischief such as breaking things and stealing items from stores. If they were required to do an extracurricular activity after school, then they'd get into less trouble because they're engaged in an activity. So instead of stealing that chocolate bar because you're bored and want attention, you could be in yearbook club snapping photos of people for this year's yearbook!

Another reason why extracurricular activities after school is a good idea is because if you're at home after school watching T.V. and playing games on your phone, the next thing you know it's seven o'clock and you still haven't done the five page essay that is due tomorrow! Extracurricular activities will not only keep you out of trouble, but they will also keep you away from your phone. Even though phones do keep us entertained, they can be very distracting and keep us from what we really need to do. If you were in homework club then you would've gotten your 5 page essay done, plus you could've made friends and not gotten distracted.

If you have trouble making friends at school then going to an after school activity would help. There are tons of activities that could help you make friends, especially sports. If you joined a sports team you'd bond together as team plus you'd stay in good, healthy condition. So instead of you laying in your bed wondering how you're going to approach someone tomorrow to say hi to and try to make a new friend, you could just join a sports team, student council, or another club to have fun and make memories.

It is a good idea for students to be in extra curricular activities because it would keep kids doing good things and keep them out of trouble, it would give them a break from their phones, and it would help making new friends. Another reason why this is a good idea is because these activities are a good stress reliever. Instead of stressing about that test you have tomorrow, you could stay after school at homework club and study with kids in your class. So your back to being the person from Generic_City, with an extracurricular activity you're required to do, it will be easy making new friends and adjusting to your new school.          ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
26810C6F8A51,"Students should be forced to do at least one extracurricular activity, because extracurricular activities are beneficial to the mind and body. For example, if someone joins a soccer team they will be more physically active. If someone joined a soccer team, they would also be better at working with other people. Or if someone joined debate club, it would improve there debate skills. If someone joined debate club, it might also make them feel more confident. Forcing students to do at least one extracurricular activity would also benefit students, because then students will meet new people.

Students should be forced to do at least one extracurricular activity, because students might learn new skills. For example, if someone joined a basketball team, they will most likely improve in basketball. Also, if a student joined clay club, there art skills will most likely improve. Or, if a student joined a baseball team, there skills in baseball will most likely improve. This is why it is better for students to learn new things, rather than not learn anything new by staying at home.

Students should be forced to do at least one extracurricular activity, because they will meet new people. For example, if a student joined track, they will probably meet new people. Also, if a student joined lacrosse, they would probably meet new people. Or, if a student joined science Olympiad, they will probably meet new people. It is good for students to meet new people, because they might make new friends.

Students should be forced to do at least one extracurricular activity, because team sports, would probably improve students teamwork skills. For example, if a student joined lacrosse, it would probably improve there teamwork skills because in lacrosse you have to have good communication to win the game. Also, if a student joined a volleyball team, there teamwork skills would probably improve, because in volleyball you have to tell your team you are going to hit the ball. Or, if a student joined a hockey team, there teamwork skills would probably improve, because your team has to have good communication to win, for example you have to know if someone on your team is trying to hit the puck to you. It is important that students have good teamwork skills, because teamwork skills are not just important in sports, but teamwork skills are also important when you have to do a class project with your group.

students should be forced to join at least one extracurricular activity, because students get a lot of benefits from joining extracurricular activities. For example, students will learn new skills by doing extracurricular activities. Also, students will meet new people by doing extracurricular activities. Students teamwork skills would also improve. It is much better for students to get all these benefits by doing extracurricular activities, rather than not doing any extracurricular activates and not learning anything new.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A265B1B9043F,"Have you ever been so busy and don't have time for nothing? Stuff just feels like it keeps on piling on you. I know how that feels. That is why students should not have to do extracurricular activity because students all ready have plans, students like to go home after school, and students have to keep grades good.

To begin, extracurricular activity take away from other plans students have to do such as hanging out with your friends and family. For example, most students do sports but they get annoyed because they never have time to go to the movies or the mall with their friends cause they all ways have to practice. Also, sometimes students get out of practice late so students won't have time to go anywhere. Unfortunately, if they had plans they would be ruined. Another thing, is students won't have time for their families and that's sad because family is very important. That is why students do not like doing extra stuff after school.

In addition, some students are not active like others. Therefore,students like to go home and just chill and stay on their phones. Also, some students are anti-social which makes it hard for them to talk to people when you are doing activities you have to be able to talk to people. However, In some students eyes staying at home watching YouTube is way more interesting then going outside or doing indoor activities.

Also, when students are doing activities they grades have to stay up sometimes that can be difficult for students because they're more focus on the activity they're doing then their work. For example, if students are in basketball if they didn't get their work done in school they have to stay on the bench and do their work. Therefore, it can get stressful cause you want to get up and play but you can not because you are falling behind in school.

In conclusion, students shouldn't do activities cause they have to much on their plates. Also, it causes a lot of stress on the students. But I may be wrong what do you think students should do when it comes to extracurricular activities.                              ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
D2DB6F31B6D2,"Some schools may force their students to participate in something they don't want to, and that's just unfair to them. Nobody likes to be forced to do something in any scenario, especially kids who just want to relax and have fun. Students shouldn't have to participate in an activity because it would cause to much pressure, they would lose their freedom, and too many kids might like the same thing and overload it.

One thing that kids cherish the most about school is meeting new friends and hanging out with them after school, but extracurricular activities can get in the way of that. Kids should be able to do whatever they want after school instead of being forced to go to soccer practice. Kids have rights, just like adults and making them do something is a direct violation of their 1st Amendment rights. But some of them might like what their doing, and others don't. They shouldn't have to do something that they don't like to pass the grade. That restriction of their freedom can also lead to too much pressure on their heads.

Having to do something after school can interfere with free time for kids to work on their homework and unfinished school work. Then, all of the sudden, middle school becomes a giant juggling game of sports and work, and it can really effect some kids with poor time-management skills. Constantly moving around to get everything done can cause a great deal of stress on the person handling it all. If you end up trying to handle one thing at a time, it can draw attention from everything else and cause even more stress than before. Another thing that may cause more stress is being surrounded by a lot of people that want the same thing as you.

If you make an entire school do at least one thing, lots of them will have the same interest and it might overflow with participants. With so many people for one specific thing, it might run out of equipment to use and will be very expensive to keep up, including damages. For sports teams, there are try-outs for who will make the team, and with so many people, they will have to compete harder for that spot on the team and may cause disputes or fighting. Also, with so many people trying out and so little spots open, lots of kids will get rejected and lose their self-confidence. Nobody likes to get rejected.

Knowing that making students do an activity can restrict their freedom, cause pressure, and overflow one specific activity, what's the point in making them do it with so many disadvantages? If the students are stressed and under pressure, it might effect how well they do in school. Also, if there are too many kids and not enough equipment, who is going to pay for it? A good school is a happy school, where students can finish their work without being interrupted, roam the halls and have fun! With that in mind, will you take up an activity for fun, or by force?",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
449481205E2D,"This rule is foolish! I disagree with the principal, I believe that it is not required for a student to participate in a extracurricular activity. Although it is a good for them to participate if they want to. Students should at least have a choice between participating in a activity or not.

You may be asking ""How does an activity distract students?"". If they are doing a activity, their time is less flexible. This means that they won't turn in work on time or even worse, not doing schoolwork at all. This is exactly what happened when the principal forced me to join the book club. My grades went down because the book club took up the time that I used for doing work.

Also, If a student is already participating in activities he or she may not be able to attend these school activities that the principal is enforcing. When my principal started the rule, I had soccer practice everyday right after school. When he announced that everybody has to participate in a activity after school, I didn't know what to do. I talked to my mom and she said that she won't allow me to stay after school to do something my principal wants me to do. She'd rather pay for something I liked doing and that was soccer.

In conclusion this rule is very unnecessary because it distracts students from doing school work, Students could have no time to do school activities and parents could be concerned. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
97FDA53146BE,"I feel this is a good thing,because the kids could get in shape or learn a new skill that could also make people stronger. So then the clinic in the school could have less people in there as well. On the bad side it could mean less family time, less sleep, and less or stuff you enjoy and are not forced to do. The principal might have done that to make the school look better or for the kids to be better at a variety of things. Also the principal could have done that because the sports there dont have enough players. The kids could have one of two responses to the decision the principal made. They could be mad at the principal because they want to go home right after school and rest all evening. And be able to do something there not forced to do. They could also be happy because there parents might not have let them play sports and now its requied so they can now play a sport. Or help with the yearbook after school. The sports players are probably happy about the decision the principal made. Because they can now have a full team and probably extra people to and they would actually be able to play a season because they have a full team.

Overall i feel like its not that bad of a decision from the principal depending on what the reason he did that was for. If the principal did it for the school to look better and get money back then i dont agree with the principal at all,because there are other ways of getting money and making the school look better without forcing the kids to do something some off them may not like. And risking losing kids from your school,If the pricipal did it for the kids to get in shape and learn a variety of different skills. Then yes i agree with him 100 percent because that could cut the amount of people going to the clinic and varies things like that,which means kids are missing less class time to go to the clinic. The parents will most likely have one of the two same responses as the kids and some might even move there familys to a new school due to the decision the principal made. Some of the kids may even not play nor do what there told because it is a demamded thing from the principal you cant just get kicked out and do something else. The principal might change it do to what the outcome of the principal forcing that is .If alot of people leave due to the principal forcing that then. The principal will most likely get rid of it but if very few people leave and some new kids come then he most likely isnt gonna get rid of it.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
780B8C757C48,"Everyday at school, I see fliers and hear announcements about my school's many clubs that are widely prevalent in my middle school environment. I always wonder why I still haven't thought about joining any of them even if I don't have interest or time to do so. However, today my principal has enforced a rule on all of the students that they must be involved in at least one extracurricular activity at is available at my school. At first, I thought that this action was nonessential and did not want this to be a part of our school lives. Although, I realized that this change could benefit me and all of my other peers because extracurricular activities would actually help students engage in their personal interests, help students make new friends with similar interests, and most importantly help students explore a new interest by joining any of the clubs that my school provides.

One reason why I agree with my principal's decision is that the clubs that the school provides can help students engage in their interests, hobbies, and goals by having its activities relate to each student's personal interests. If the student is interested in basketball or any other sport, then he or she can tryout for each of the school's sport teams engage in the activity that interests him or her the most. A debate club could allow students to freely express their ideas and opinions in a environment and community that politely agrees or disagrees with their topic. A club that does or does not involve the school's curricular activities can even inspire a student's future career choice. Clubs are a great way for my fellow students to engage in what they like and possibly for influence a student's career goals.

Another reason why my principal's decision was a good idea is because students who get involved in the school's clubs can maybe make new friends within the club. This is because students are more likely to make friends with someone with similar interests to them. Clubs and other extracurricular activities allow communities of students to work together to achieve a certain goal. For example, a school hockey team's goal is to work together to conquer other teams from the same school or different schools within the general area the school is located at. Students can share their ideas with people who can understand their thinking because of the topic of the club that they are involved in. Students can even learn new things about their interest from others who know more about their interest than them.

An additional reason why my principal's action could benefit everyone is because the school's extracurricular activities allow students to find and explore a new interest. A student could form a new hobby if they have the courage to try any new activity that is out of their comfort zone. Trying new things is important to your self-image because it will help you explore who you are and what your main goal is for the future. I really like how these clubs encourage students to try new things because not trying shows that you are not willing to have thought in how they can change to be as successful as they can be in the future when they are in charge of making their own decisions in life. A new interest could help improve your mental health because changing and exploring who you are can make you feel great about your own personal efforts to be proud of who you are.

I would personally take in part of an extracurricular activity not just because my principal want me to, but because I believe that it would be worth it to pursue in my interests later on in my life. I need to decide what I want to do knowing that I won't have my parents to make all of my decisions for me. I may be joining many different clubs throughout the year no matter if they work out for me or not because all that matter is that I am trying new things. Clubs could benefit anyone in many different ways whether if it influence their future career or if it is just a personal hobby that they want to try out in. I am grateful that these clubs are able to encourage my fellow students and I to put effort into something they love or to bring up the courage to try something completely new.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
D6EF8C8D2542,"Should students have to participate in extracurricular activities? I believe extra curricular activies should be required in schools. Extracurricular activities have been proven to benefit students in many different ways. I believe students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will meet new people, discover new interest, and participate in some friendly competition.

First, students can meet new people if they were to do extracurricular activites. If students were in an extracurricular activity then students could see things from other student's perspectives. Seeing things from other student's perspectives might influence students to think differently about something or might let students see something in a way they never had before. Also, if students were to partcipate in extrcurricular activites students could make new friends which improves their social skills. Heightened social skills could help students later in life with things like job interviews, applying for college, and maybe even finding that ""special someone"". Maybe, if students were to meet new people, students could find things that they enjoy about someone else and try to apply that to themselves. For example, maybe someone is filled with charm and they love that about them, so they try to be more charming.

Next, students could discover new interest. It is possible that students could find something that they had no idea intrested them. Finding new things about yourself is very beneficial when trying to look for something new. The world would be a very dull place if everyone always did the same thing over and over again. Therefore, students should step out of their comfort zone and try something new every once and a while. Trying out new things might even help students see people and the world differently. Students could learn things about the world that they never thought possible.

Lastly, extracurricular activies could promote students to paricipate in friendly competition. A little friendly competition can strive students to do their best. When students give it their all, they usually feel proud about how much effort they put in. For instance, if students do their best, students will feel motivated to work harder and push their limits. Students may set new goals to be the best that they could possibly be. Also, everyone wants to win but friendly competition can teach students that it is okay not to win everytime, which can improve sportmanship.

In conclusion, students should participate in extracurricular activities because students will improve multiple skills, they can learn more about themsleves, and students can learn to work well with others. Another point is that, many students do not participate in extra curricular activities. I believe there are multiple reasons why students do not participate, but I think because they take time out of the day and students believe they will not be interesting and that they will not enjoy them are the biggest factors. Therefore, if students are obligated to participate they might change their mind and join more activities as the years go on. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
1F1036C2B418,"Did you know that only 10% of students in Generic_City participate in at least one extracurricular activity and only 4% of students at Generic_School as a sport, joining the yearbook committee, serving the student council, or any after school club, the students at Generic_School would become more involved in their community and want to help their community for the better. A study done by Harvard University in 2017 proved that only 30% of the students in Virginia participate in at least one extracurricular activity and of those students, 28% are active in their community and have helped their communities by fund raising for an important cause, petitioning for changes in their communities, and encouraging good habits such as recycling and healthy eating habits. Although this percentage of students in Virginia is very low, the rate of students who are active in their community is very high, based on these numbers. This proves that if our students participate in extracurricular activities, they are also more likely to impact their communities for the better which is why we need this policy in our school. Not only could the students at Generic_School impact their communities for the better, but participating in extracurricular activities could also help our students make new friends and find new interests.

By requiring our young learners to participate in an extracurricular activity, we are also encouraging them to reach outside of their comfort zones and try something new. This new activity could help them make new friends and they may even find new and exciting interests that they never new they would like. If our students stuck to the same routine every day and never tried anything new, they may never find any activities that may excite them and spark new interests in them. Therefore, our students would start to become bored in school and feel less encouraged to do well and study hard to get good grades. When I was in the beginning of fifth grade, I felt excited to start off a new and fun year as a fifth grader. This excitement slowly started to wear off a quarter way through the year and I started to feel less encouraged to continue working hard and striving to get the best grades that I could. I was beginning to feel bored with the same routine that I had maintained over the past few years and I hoped that I could try something new and refreshing that would make me more excited about school and my everyday life. One day, my mom asked me if I wanted to try a dance class at a studio that I had never heard of. Out of pure excitement, I agreed and that whole week, I was looking forward to the day that I would go to dance class. When the day of the class came, I was shy, but I managed to make friends with all of the girls and I had found a new interest in dance. Not only did this new experience help me make new friends and find a new interest, but it also made me feel encouraged in school to keep working hard throughout the week until my weekly dance class on Saturday. My grades started to go up and I was more happy and encouraged to do well in everything I did. This new dance class had helped me find new friends, find a new interest, and get better grades. To this day, I still dance and I could not imagine my life without it. Not only does requiring our students to participate in a new activity help them find new interests and make friends, but it also could help our students get into good schools in the future, and therefore get better jobs and become more successful.

By requiring our students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, we could also be helping these students get into good colleges and we could be setting them up for a very bright future. With this new policy, our students will be able to add to their resumes that they have participated in a variety of activities that may seem very impressive to college school boards, as they tend to find interest in students who have a variety of extracurricular activities. After going to a great college, our students will be sent into interviews for jobs. With their resumes saying that they went to an impressive college, they will be accepted into their dream jobs. This amazing future for our students is all because of this policy. Without it, we would be denying our students from the future they deserve. A study by Yale University in 2018 has shown that 80% of colleges base their acceptances of students based on the variety of extracurricular activities that they are in. This proves that with our new policy, we could be helping our students get into better schools. Not only will this policy help our students have a bright future, but it will also help them become better students and adults in the future.

Generic_School needs to require our students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would help our students become more active and involved in their communities, it would help them make new friends and help them find new interests, and it would help our students get into good colleges and get good jobs, leading them to the bright futures that they deserve. This policy would be helping our students in the long run, and I strongly encourage that you will decide to enforce this new rule.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
917524B223F8,"Have you ever been interested in something such as a sport or maybe even science? Activities such as these are offered by schools. Students can join these extracurricular activities, allowing them to learn about these topics and be around other people who have similar interests. Extracurricular activities can be great but unfortunately most people do not know that. There are many benefits to requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities such as improving students mental health, improving their physical health, and improving the school. Schools should require all students to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Requiring extracurricular activities is a great way to increase a student's mental health. When required to choose an activity, students choose the activity that seems to be the best to them. This causes students to find an interest that if they had not joined an extracurricular activity, would have never discovered that they enjoy. Having interests and hobbies such as these activities is a great way to increase mental health. They help people find happiness in life. It gives people something they enjoy and can spend their time doing. Since students are interested in the activity or activities that they participate in, they can be more social. Once a student joins an extracurricular activity they can talk to people with similar interests and make friends. Being social has an amazing impact on a person's mental health and these activities make that happen. There are many benefits to a student's mental health caused by these activities but these activities can also improve a student's physical health.

These activities can have a great impression on a student's physical health. Often times students do not get the exercise that they need to be healthy. Students often go home and sit down to do homework, watch tv, and do other activities that have little to no benefit for their health. Extracurricular activities such as sports can help students get the exercise that they need. By participating in these types of activities students can go outside, exercise, and do other activities that improve their physical health. Although these activities have great benefits students still decide to not sign up for them. This is why requiring students to join an activity is a great idea. Students can discover that they like the activity whilst also being healthy. There are many health benefits to requiring extracurricular activities but there are also other benefits.

Another benefit to requiring extracurricular activities is improving the school. It would allow students to increase their academic abilities. Students have the option to choose academic activities that are related to subjects such as science. In these activities students would be able to learn and become interested in the topic. As a result of learning students improve in class. This would raise the student's grades and the school's average. Not only will the student's academic abilities be improved but also the activities that they are participating in. More students participating in the activities would mean that there would be more ideas in activities such as student council or more skilled people on sports teams. Lastly, it would improve the school because of the interested and active students. When people get interested in a topic, hobby, or activity they generally care about it. For example, students who play sports want to improve not only their abilities but also the activity itself. This could be done in many ways including doing something such as getting new sports equipment.

In conclusion students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These activities are great for the student's mental health by creating a hobby for students that they enjoy. They also have a great effect on the student's physical health by helping them get the exercise they need. Lastly, they benefit the school and activities themselves by improving education and student participation. All schools across the world should require students to participate in an extracurricular activity.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
03C562EF629C,"Does sitting inside and doing nothing but homework and chores all day sound exciting? Or would you rather have an opportunity to do fun activities with other people, making friends and improving your health along the way? If the latter sounds like the more appealing option, than you should support our principal's decision to make taking an extracurricular program mandatory. Requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity is the perfect choice for our school. That is because it opens up new and unexpected opportunities, provides an outlet to make new friends, and helps improve your physical and mental well being.

You should support the requirement of an extracurricular because it opens up fun and enjoyable activities that you might not have come across if not for this new policy. A very sporty kid might never know that he really enjoys being on the student council unless he tries it, and it is unlikely that he would try it any other way. The same thing works inversely, a book-smart kid could really have a great time playing basketball or football and never know it unless he tries it. The new opportunities can also help your in-school life by helping you learn about certain topics that you are struggling in or by providing service hours to contribute towards your required amount. The activity would also be a place to go every time you would rather not go home or if you just preferred to stay after school with your friends.

The same way that this policy provides an outlet to new activities that you might not have found otherwise, it also paves the way to making you friends that you wouldn't have been friends with in any other situation. If you are a new addition to a certain group and you feel lost with how much more accustomed everyone else is to the group, you could make friends with an elder statesmen type of the group, in a mentor-apprentice kind of way. Many times, you could find people who are in the same situation that you are. If you got to know them and started working together with them, you could both benefit by learning how the group works. Overall, it would just be a fantastic way to gain friends, especially with people who are having a hard time getting to know new people.

Another great way that this program is going to help is how it improves your physical and mental health. School can get very stressful at times, and the amount of homework, studying, test-taking, and other school things on top of the everyday teenage problems that you have can start to feel draining, like a heavy weight being pushed down on you. Extracurricular programs relieve a lot of that stress by being a place where you can slow down a little bit and be more involved in things you actually enjoy being involved in. The physical activities, such as baseball or basketball, are a great place to get some exercise in to improve your physical life. A lot of students this age have it rough in that they might not have a lot of friends or people to talk to, so just a simple activity like the yearbook club could help relieve an immense amount of emotional weight off of that student by actually giving them someone to talk about their problems to.

The intelligent choice by our principal to make at least one extracurricular program mandatory is an incredibly beneficial choice to all who are involved. It is a policy that gives people new chances to find something that they like doing, helps students make friends with people that they likely wouldn't have otherwise, and improves the physical and mental health of those students who need the improvement. If you are for the well-being of students and the developmental growth of the people who are the future of our nation, then you should be for this policy. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
A2E1F55E3696,"Do you ever wish that you could have the chance to do a fun activity during or after school? Some schools are making students participate in extracurricular activities. I believe students should have to do an extracurricular activity because it can start new friendships, and in could be fun.

Doing extracurricular activities can start new friendships. If you find someone with the same interest as you, then you two may become friends. It can be hard for people to meet new friends, but if you find someone with a similar interest then it could be easier to become friends with them. Secondly you guys could do activities together. If you two were to both to play an instrument, then you could practice together. Doing an extracurricular activity could give you topics to talk about with friends. If your at lunch one day and you run out of things to talk about, your extracurricular activity could be a good topic. If you miss out on an opportunity for an extracurricular activity, then you could be missing out on an amazing friendship

Participating in extracurricular activities could be fun. first off there are field trips. Why wouldn't you want to skip a day of school and hang out with friends on a fun field trip? Also you get to do something you enjoy. It can give you a little extra time doing what you love. Lastly it can open up new opportunities. Things like band and orchestra may have festivals or auditions that you could do. Extracurricular activities can give you lots of chances to have fun, and enjoy school a little more.

However, some people may say that students will lose interest. They say picking the wrong topic could lead to a year of being board. This could make students dislike the class or not want to go to it. Although, most students say that they enjoy their extracurricular activity, and even if its not their favorite class, they don't dread going to it. For example if a student liked science class more than yearbook, that doesn't mean that the student doesn't want to go to school. But if a student really didn't like the class, then they would know in the future not to pick it again. It would at the least give a student direction on if they would want to do that activity again. Even though people say that kids will lose interest in the activity they choose, students will always be able to get something out of it.

Having to do an extracurricular activity could lead to new friendships and a year of fun. Being able to experience a extracurricular activity can be a great way to open yourself up to new things, and try different activities. You'll never know what you missed out on if you don't take an extracurricular activity. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
5D843D1CD37D,"I agree because maybe it could lead to new friendships or relate able things or a thing with a teacher. For example I had to do an assignment similar to this and I told them all of my most productive activates I could think of and almost everyone was similar to my activities like they do the same activities as I do too. You'll never know if you meet new people that you've never seen before or heard before and they turn nice and you guys could be good friends. I had friends from my soccer team and they were in my school that I didn't even knew that they were in my school so I started to hang out with them in school and after soccer practice. It's basically about friendship because if someone wants to meet more and new people they should go try out something they like and try it out with their future friends and enjoy together. For example, I keep meeting more and more people because of after school activities or someone in school that is friends with their friends. If you disagreed with the principals decision you would just do the same routine all year until summer has came and then high school and then that will be the similar routine and then graduation and then you've decided to go to college and it's another same routine for how long you're gonna be there and then you get a job and it'll be another same routine until you retire and then you just go home and rest until you die, sure it would be similar if you agreed but sometimes you just gotta try what's new what's been going on or how's it going go out with your friends and then you guys get closer and you've decided you guys wanted to hang out and do whatever you want to do. Sometimes your parents might force you do to some activities at school or outside of school it's because they want you to feel like you've like accomplished everything in life and you've decided to try something new for once and will actually enjoy it and stick to it as long as you live or until you quit or retire. You might even find your furture date and be very distance get to know each other so I am agreeing because it causes friendships doesn't have to be home all day and some thing you might like.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
B9FEF2CA826E,"Sometimes, students all they want to do, is be on their phones all day and do nothing,i would recommend that students join an activity they enjoy, and effects them in their future career. In that case, I agree with the principal's decision, that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. My reasons for my decision are students can become more successful,and they can prepare for what they want to be when they grow up.

My first reason is, students can be more successful, and by that i mean better grades. nowadays kids grades drop really low because they are late to class,skip school,or don't pay attention, young teenagers miss a lot of information given by their teacher by not doing what they are supposed to. Staying after school with teachers can catch them up with their work, and help them achieve better goals.

However,activities can prepare young adults, for what they want to be went they grow up. If the student want's to be a professional player they might as well join a sport and practice new skills. Or if a students want to be a chef like the pionneer woman that sells pans and utensils,they could join a cooking class after school. Or somehow they want to be an actor or actress,stay after for more practices in the Drama club.

Wouldn't you want to see your kids graduating college with a master degree? Yes, every parent wishes that for their kids. In that matter students could join extracurricular activities,do community hours, prepare for what they want to be, and be successful.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
8.71E+11,"Imagine every single student at your school is associated/participating in a sport, helping the yearbook committee, or even just serving on the student council because it could greatly impact the school by making it more organized and ""healthier"". Well thats exactly what my principle has decided to do. But not only can this change how there doing in school, it can also affect how they are struggling financially with all the fees they have to pay.

Time plays an important role in this because a lot of students wont be able to fit an extra material into there daily schedules because there already jam packed with other things they need to do throughout the day. This is also a little cruel for students because they would have to be occupied with numerous things at once and still remember to do other things. If the principles say that we must do an extracurricular activity, we wont have any time to do our own things. Students dont like to be stressed out and having to do lots of things at once. We already get tons of homework that some of us dont even finish because of the time we have isnt enough. So students might even stop turning in homework on time or even at all. Because focusing on other things has made it harder for them to keep up with school work. And then the student is blamed on for not doing it, but its not really there fault that they dont have enough time at home to finish everything. Students are getting the time taken away that they could use to do something that they enjoy like; spending time with there pets, relaxing, hanging out with friends etc. And that could affect how there school performance is going. Also they time they should be using as homework there turning in there free time because they dont have any other time for themselves.

Money is also a problem in this situation because not everyone is going to have the necessary money needed to pay off the fees, or to get the materials needed for the activity they have chosen to do. But if the school offers to help pay the fees, then it would be a lot easier for those who need help financially. Im not saying they should pay the full price, but that they could help pay some of it, and the family getting helped does too;so that way they are both contributing. If money support isnt an option for them, then they just wont be able to participate and that should be blamed on the school not the family because its not their fault there struggling and cant afford to pay there children activities that the school says they ""must"" do. But whats the school going to do if they dont? suspend them? I think not.

Most students wouldnt even want to participate in an extra curricular activity because they are already stressed out at home and have other things to deal with. Maybe the student is going through a rough time and doesnt want to be pressured into doing something extra thats just going to worsen there problem. So they shouldnt be forced to do something they dont want.

Overall the schools shouldnt be doing this because its just a waste of time, money, and academic time. students already have a handful of things they need to keep up with for example: homework, they usually get it everyday with every class; that is already stressful enough. Religious activities like attending church or going to mutual, babysitting for friends or family, or even just spending time with friends,family and even pets. But with the school making us do other extracurricular activities, we wont have time do to what we enjoy and make us happy. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
9BBB0205D3C0,"I agree that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, no matter who they are. An extracurricular activity is an activity that enhances the knowledge of a particular subject. It goes beyond the standard curriculum that is taught in classes at school. This activity could be formal like an honors society, math league, or engineering program, or you could take a more active route and play football, track, or swim. The list could go on and on, ensuring that students can find an activity they're interested in participating in.

Participating in at least one extracurricular could give you greater opportunities for the future. It could help you manifest your desired college. Colleges really like when a student is involved with an extracurricular and it makes sense why. It shows that you are willing to go deeper in your learning of a subject. This drive to push yourself can also reflect in your work ethic, benefiting your grades and mindset. If this behavior continues, it could help you in the future with any job you have and even get you, or help you find, your dream career.

An extracurricular provides a fun environment. If you are truly doing what you are interested in, it should be enjoyable. They are also a great way to socialize and get out of the house. You can meet many new and great friends along the way. An Extracurricular can create a safe environment for students. Students feel like they belong somewhere and can be themselves alongside others that share the same passion as them.

I positively agree that a student should be in at least one extracurricular. They don't even have to take up that much time. There are an amazing amount of opportunities and benefits that come from them that shouldn't be passed. It could just be something to do after school, or it could be what you love to do.

They should do these activities because it can benefit his or her life later on, it can help their school education, and it can make them more physically active for the upcoming sports they wanna do. Some extracurricular activities can be fun to do too!

Extracurricular activities can benefit his or her life later on. When students do some of these activities work employees might be needing some of that skill for their business. Some of the activities can help you get jobs that pay you well to serve your loved ones. Students could serve or even help their country by doing these activities! Activities like artclub and student council and other activities can benefit them.

After school programs are activities that could help your education. Education is a really important thing in life. It can help you out later on when your an adult. Some schools have after school programs that help out your education. The more education students have the more easier it will be for them.

Some activities can help their physical life. Being more active can benefit their health and let them live longer as they get older and keep doing sports. Extracurricular activities like track, soccer, and baseball can be good for your health because the more they do it then the less tired they will get. Soccer and track can be good for their stamina because they will be able to run fo long periods of time without getting tired. Sports can get you payed very well if your really good and the more better you are then more people are gonna want you to play for them and they will pay you good amounts of money.

I know as a student that it is stressful to get good grades will having a social life too. Many kids have anxiety which effects there social skills and there friendships. Although some kid just dont like being social or working along side someone they dont know. Most extracurricular involve social skills like, talking to a teammate. helping someone with a project, or just playing a game like football or soccer. Whats to say that someone dont have server anxiety where they cant be around other people.

Sports are extracurricular that u need money to be apart of but what happens when i student dont have the money to join the team. Many other clubs make u pay a fee to join. If you do a project in a club you may need money to bye the supplies for said project. Gasoline also coast's a lot today and u need that to get to the extracurricular. What happens when your parents cant bring u to the meeting or the games that affects the way u partake in the group setting.

Parents are over protective of there kids, some parents wont let there kid join because of there protectiveness. And sports are very dangers if not played properly. there parent also might want them to stay at home so they can do family activities together. and what if i child has a Illness and cant do extracurricular became of there illness or disability.

parents can also be really attached to their kid so much they dont want then to go to school.

I strongly agree with extracurricular activities being added to the daily schedule because it can make you successful in the future, It can build up useful skills you never though you needed, and can give you an extrodinary outcome you never knew would actually come true.

8DF155F94446,"I was in the hallways looking for an after school activity I couldn't find one that I liked or seemed interesting. The principal made it so that everyone has to do an extracurricular activity after school. I disagree with this decision.

I disagree with this decicion because some people just don't get along with others and those activities require them to talk to people they may not like. Some people are shy and get nervous talking to people. Others are rude and don't like people in general, and people don't want to talk to them. Some people just can't make friends because they're funny looking. People like those anime kids probably can't make friends either because they stay hissing at people and having crushes on cartoon charaters. People can be depressed and not want to do anything after school just go home and lay in their bed the rest of the day.

If someone has do to a sport because there is no other activities to do them they won't enjoy what they're doing. Even if they end up liking it they are doing it for fun not because they want to win everygame. Also is it's a sport you are making thwem spent their money on something you forced them to do. They could have used that money for something that they actually need like food or for paying their bills but no you want them to pay for a jersey, shoes, special socks and they didn't even want to do the sport in the first place. Their family could be really struggling to pay the rent and you want them to give you $100 for a jersey.

Some people might not even enjoy being out doors or they might not be in the mood to be doing stuff like that they just want to go home to their dog or to their nice and comfertable bed but no you want them to spend more energy on after school stuff and teachers already complain about how some kids never do their work and thye dotn care what the excuse is. Someone could say ""Sorry I couldn't do my homework my grandpa died yesterday"" and the teacher would say ""that's tough you should have done before he died you had time then didn't you"" and with everyone doing after school activities there is no time for homework because you get home around six or seven then you eat because you must be starving then you take a shower and boom it's time to sleep and you got no homework done.

I disagree with the decision to make everyone have an after school activity becuase not everyone has time or the personality to be hanging out with random people everyday after school. Some people might be depressed and others can't make friends. Not everyone has the money for supplies they need for their activity.

A2C3E5A5B48B,"Did you ever have an extracurricular activity or also known as an after school activity in school? Some students after school participate in clubs or sports like the year book, student council, or football. Now some schools they may require you to participate in an after school activity, and others may not. Personally i am against it because many students work after school, many students have no interest in any, and many students who dont want to be there will be a distraction to those who do want to be there.

First there a quiet a few people work after school, it may be a legit job, or baby sitting, or cleaning out a neighbors yard thats how they earn money. If they have to participate in an after school activity they cant get money to be able to support there self. They may even become unreliable if they have to keep taking time of work to do a school activity. If you ever do small jobs such as baby sitting, and yard work for other people you have to be reliable and if they need you to do it a certain day you pretty much have to unless you want to lose that job of yours.

Secondly some students just may have no interest in any of them. Maybe a few students interest happen during school such as welding and culinary. Now if your already doing what you want to do why would you do anything else if you have no interest. If they dont want to be there they can be a distraction to those who do, and it could cause problems between members.

Lastly it could cause stress. School puts pressure on its students and putting another on top of it will make it worse. Have you ever stopped and thought about what students do daily between there classes with project and home work. Some students manage it but others cant and often blow up with all the stress they're going through. Some students often go to there guidance counselor to know how to deal with stress and often times go back to them again.

In conclusion an after school activity is bad for students because it takes up time for a job, some students dont want to there, and it causes stress. Now of course there are some cons like that it helps you socials more, but if they dont want to be there you'll find them not socializing. Its just not good for students at all if they want to do an after school activity it is there choice.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Forcing someone is not good because you cant tell someone do things that they couldnt do. Some people dont like playing sports, working the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

Not everyone have the same opinion, but many people have different opinion. Forcing an students to do something probably make them feel that they have no rights.

The students should decide what they should do, not the principal because students should get their own opinions. Letting the principal decide the students what to do, make me feel not very good because it make me feel like he is telling me what to do and i dont like that.

Some other people are not good at doing sports or working the year. Some people are different from others. Some students are best other things and some are not. Many students have their own taste on something.

3F535B618050,"How would you feel if everyday after eight hours of sitting at a table, righting down notes, listening to someone talk to you about something you may or may not like, getting up for five minutes just for it to happen again, and then when the bell rings instead of going home you go into another classroom to do an activity you dont like and didnt choose? Because that is what it would be like for students if they had mandatory extracurricular activities. Every student having to go to a after school has been a very debated issue for a long time. Mandatory extracurricular activities have their benefits, but their cons out weigh them. The principal of Generic_School middle school has decided that this is false, and that every person going to a after school is a great idea. I disagree with this, and here's why. Students should not have to attend extracurricular programs because of their freedom of choice, not all after schools are equal, and because of the funds needed for them.

First Students should have the ability to choose which after school program they would like to go to. One reason they should be able to do this is they can spend more time with their family which is very important in this stage of their life. Another is that they could choose to do homework instead which I think is something many of them would rather do. Finishing homework gives a senses of relief that it is over and you have nothing to be concerned about. My last reason to support this is letting students make their own decisions makes them more independent as well as learn life lessons you cant get in school. For example they could decided that ""I want to put in one and a half hours into my homework, thirty minutes to study, one hour to have dinner, and four hours of free time.""

Secondly not all of the extracurricular activities the school provides are equal. This is shown in how much time some activities require. Specifically a student may have to go to basketball practice very day while a person in the art club only goes once a week. The next way they are unequal is in how much effort is put into the after school. An example of this is a teen in the book club would need to put in far less effort than someone on the debate team.

The third way extracurricular programs are not equal is in how much is costs to run them. For instance In the art club they use lots of very expensive materials like paints, canvases, and clay. This would cost much more that the soccer team that only needs to replace soccer balls and goals. This leads me to my next reason why Generic_School should not have mandatory after schools

The last reason as to why we should not have mandatory extracurricular programs is the amount of money needed to support all of the activities. Having enough after schools so that all of the kids will be able to go to them will put a lot of strain on the schools finances. This will result in the school not being able to adequately educate their students during the actual school day. If the burden of whos to pay for the extracurricular activities does not fall on the school it will fall on others in one of two ways. The first way is they will charged the parents of the kids directly. Many family's cant pay the cost of the after schools even if they wanted to making the the school still suffer a loss. The second way is to raise taxes which will give parents a lesser financial burden than charging them directly, but will make taxes high for others who don't have kids and will surely not go down well.

In conclusion being able to choose which extracurricular activity you desire, the after school programs being unequal, and the cost to run them are all very good reasons why Generic_School should not have mandatory after schools. If you agree with this than wright a letter to your or our school board telling them your own reasons as to why schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities.

3EE4F2B2B160,"I agree that all students should have to participate in an extracurricular activity.

I agree with this because extracurricular activities will help students physical health.

Extracurricular activities will help with students mental health.

And extracurricular activities will help with students socially.

In my opinion, extracurricular activities have only positive aspects.

First, physical health will be improved if all students are made to do a extracurricular activity.

Students that choose to do a sport will have to exercise with their team and will have to go to the games and practices.

Students that do extracurricular activities are generally more productive than students that don't do one.

Also, students will have to exercise with their teams and won't be able to procrastinate.

Extracurricular activities will only improve students physical health and will not make them any unhealthier.

Secondly, students mental health will be improved if they're are made to do an extracurricular activity.

When you are doing something your brain is always exercising.

Students that have a strong physical health generally have a strong mental health.

However, this is not always the case.

When you are part of a group you all feel like you're a family, causing you to feel like your part of something.

When your brain is being made to exercise there are no negatives to it, there are only positives.

Finally, being part of an extracurricular activity will make you feel better socially.

When the people that you spend the most time with are your friends you become closer.

You can also make new friends and meet new people that have the same interest as you.

You will be exercising with your friends which will only make your relationship with them healthier.

In my opinion, being in an extracurricular activity can only make you and the people you are surrounded by more social.

Extracurricular activities have many positives towards helping teenagers in their life.

However, there can be some negatives towards extracurricular activities such as getting injured, or not being able to hangout with people.

But all of these reasons are just part of life and I believe that all teenagers need to be exposed to what will happen to them in the real world.        ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
497842E73629,"What if your principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity? How would you respond to that? Would you go against them or stand with them? My principal made that decision for our school and I am standing with him! Extracurricular activities benefit the community, the students, and the school.

Extracurricular activities are an extreme benefit and help to the community. Many clubs actually are made to serve and make changes to the community. However, many people believe that students shouldn't be the ones having to do extra work to help out. It isn't all about the changes or the service it also helps them come together as a community and accomplish things as a team. Extracurricular activities help build a strong, healthy, and happy community.

Benefiting the students is another thing extracurricular activities do. Students learn many skills such as teamwork, leadership, and responsibility when they take part in these activities. Extracurricular activities teach students many things that they wouldn't learn during school hours or class time. When the students take part in these amazing things, the build an even more amazing reputation for themselves. Many say that students will lose focus and interest in school when they take a part in extracurricular activities. But, in reality extracurricular activities are the reason some students come to school and strive to do their best.

Schools benefit a lot from extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities keep schools motivated and running smoothly. Many extracurricular activities require competition this means they keep healthy competition going. Clubs and teams bring the school closer. Students feel as isn't just a place to do pencil paper work when they can actually do these things and them be associated with school. These activities surely are expensive on school. But, the experiences that they bring students are worth more than a million dollars.

Extracurricular activities benefit the community, the students, and the school. Extracurricular activities help build a strong, healthy, and happy community. Extracurricular activities are the reason students are great leaders and strive to do their best. These activities help a school build their backbone and the way others see them as a whole. Wouldn't it be amazing if your principal made you take part in these activities!",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
FDC077398F13,"The principal just announced a new school rule. The rule says that every student has to participate in at least on after school activity. To some people, this is a great idea. To other, it might not sound too great. In this paper, I will tell you my side on this new rule. Afterwards, I will try to convince you why you should support my claims.

First of all, I should let you know which side I'm on. Whether I support the new rule or not. To be brief , I do support this new rule. The principal took a risk with this. The risk he took is the reaction of the parents and the teachers. Even with all of that though, in the long run, this rule will pay off.

In this paragraph, I will be stating different factors, pros, opinions, and more. Everything I state is to convince you to support my side of this new rule. First of all, the extracurricular activities can make students happier when they choose an activity they love. This can motivate them to work better and harder in and out of school. Secondly, it will push students to be well-rounded. Third of all, it can push kids to do their very best. The coaches, helpers, and other adults in the students' life will push them and have them strive to be great.

Going off of my last paragraph, I will continue listing ways that the new rule is a good thing. The difference is that I will be talking about mostly the parent benefits. First of all, when kids are at their activities, the parents have more time to relax and not worry as much. Also, if every single student is at an activity, then more people can set up carpools. In addition to what I said before, about the student being happier and doing better in school, they can have better behavior and attitude at home. The kids will be happier all around, which can make the parent happier. Some parents may be concerned on how their child will juggle having the activity going on and also maintaining good grades. Eventually, the kid will learn to handle it. This teaches them responsibility. This skill can be used at school, home, and anywhere!

In conclusion, that is my paper. I talked about how the principal introduced a new school rule that every student has to do an extracurricular activity. I talked about how I was all for that rule and the benefits that came with it. How the coaches and other adults can encourage the kids and help them strive for greatness. Also how the activities can teach them responsibility, and make them have better behavior and attitude. I hope by reading this I convinced you to accept and support the new rule. The reason is, in my opinion, the extracurricular activities make the students all around happier people. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
F1B388E9F65A,"You have so much to do! You have a pile of homework, youth group, errands, and, on top of that, you have to meet with a club that you don't want to be in. If you force someone to do things that they don't want to do, there can be a lot of negative effects. As a result, I don't think that participating in an extracurricular should be required because people who are forced to join something will probably not participate well, could get very stressed and overwhelmed with the extra load, and people who are not already in a club have multiple reasons to not join.

First off, if you aren't able to find an extracurricular that you like, you could be forced to join one. Then, if you're forced to join a club that you do not like, that could hinder the group's progress and work. For example, if someone who doesn't know how to play lacrosse joins the lacrosse team, some people would be angry. Especially if the new person doesn't want to play and doesn't know how. They are most likely diving headfirst into the sport without learning the rules. That means they wouldn't know how to check correctly, wouldn't know defense or attack, and wouldn't know the rules for scoring. On top of that, them not wanting to do lacrosse would ruin the team dynamic. We had a player one year who did not want to play on the defense, so she played the position as bad as she could, making the people who were trying to play well angry, and ruining our teamwork. So, if people don't want to participate in a club or sport, they might ruin it for everyone else, and that wouldn't be beneficial.

Next, having an extracurricular on top of everything that you already have to do, like homework or family, could make you stressed and exhausted. I know for me that having lacrosse practice, Odyssey of the Mind, and homework every single day makes me exhausted. I enjoy playing lacrosse, and I enjoy OM, but when I get home from lacrosse after an hour and a half, and having done OM before that, I have exceeded my limits of activity for the day. All that I want to do is take a shower and go to sleep. If I have to do my homework and spend more time working, I will most likely be very tired the next day. With that, other people might have little siblings that they have to take care of, and being in a club, going home and doing their homework, and after that, taking care of siblings, will give them a lot of stress to do everything fast, making them rush their homework to make sure that their sibling are cared for, or neglecting their siblings to do their homework well. Juggling multiple responsibilities can impact stress levels, productivity, and time management.

Finally, people who are not in a club can have multiple reasons not to be in a club. You could choose not to be in a club because your parents can't pick you up afterwards, you have too much homework every night, you have siblings to take care of, etcetera. People who aren't participating in any extracurriculars just might not want the responisibility of remembering. Everyone has a reason, even if it's that it doesn't sound interesting.

Joining an extracurricular should not be forced onto students. I think that if you force someone to do anything that they do not want to, they will not participate and that will come back around to you in negative ways.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
C9C9546EA29A,"When going into middle school and high school, most students have the opportunity to pick extra curricular activities such as sports, art, student council, and much more. These activities give them a chance to incorporate their interested into their schedules. These classes are also often beneficial to the teenage mind while they are trying to grow and explore themselves. However, should extracurricular activities should be required? Without extra curricular activities, it is harder for teens to have the opportunity to be apart of their community. They also help teens branch out, be creative, and make new friends. Extracurricular activities gives students more independence and freedom to structure their own schedules, which can get pretty busy and full of school work! Some teens, however, don't see the benefit of extracurricular activities during middle school or high school and still need a little push to get involved. Students should be required to take an extracurricular activities because, it forces them to be an active citizen who is part of the community, it gives them an opportunity to take their mind off of school, and it pushes them to go out of their comfort zone and try something new.

Requiring teens to take an extra curricula activity will help them become more involved in their school and local community, which is an important part of their lives. The average school community is made mostly of the student, so their involvement in the school is vital, even more so then the teachers. Not only does extracurricular activities help in school involvement, but it gets teens a head start to be involved in their local communities too. For example, some high school cheer leading teams not only cheer at school sports events, but cheer at town or county events. Also, lots of school art classes have their students work displayed at local shows or even just around the school building. In addition to that, lots of musical groups preform at school concerts and go to state competitions. These are only a few of the options, but almost all extracurricular activities work to get their students involved in the community. By enforcing extracurricular activities you enforce an involved lifestyle at a young age which is a skill teens can carry with them for the rest of their lives.

Not only do extracurricular activities make students lives part of the community, but takes their minds of of their stressful school life. After a long day in school students are often forced to go home and do even more school work. Teens minds are consistently on school, grades, tests, and homework. School can create an unhealthy amount of stress, especial for teens who are still growing up. It is also easy to get sucked into over working and over worrying about grades and a good GPA. Having extracurricular activities normally gives them at least an hour of time to de-stress themselves every day. Not only do they get this time to distress, but also to put their energy into something they love! It is a huge change from sitting in a classroom trying to pay attention all day. Student need this time and this outlet do things that make them happy. Requiring extracurricular activities will give all student the chance to de-stress and take their minds off school work, especially when it becomes unhealthily over whelming.

Lastly, requiring teenagers to branch out and try something new threw extracurricular activities can introduce them to new opportunities and teach them a valuable life lesson. Teens often fear trying something new or coming out of their shells. These fear often come from the fear of not being accepted or the fear of failure. Unfortunately, while trying to figure out how to fit in, teens can take the wrong path and become a bully or put themselves in danger. Extracurricular activities teaches them how to try new thing in a safe way. Breaking the ice between groups of people can be very hard and is something that most teens fear they will fail at, but it becomes a lot easier when they all share common hobbies. Extracurricular groups are like built in friends, or at least a group of people that have shared interests. Learning how to try new things, even tough it might seem scary is an important lesson that will helps teens for the rest of their lives. In conclusion, extra curricular activities will teach teens how to branch out and try new things, a skill that they will use even in adulthood.

Teaching teens how to become part of their community, take their mind off of school, and try new things, are all benefits to requiring students to take at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities force kids to not only be involved at school, but locally in their town and city. They also let kids have a built in break from the stress that school brings. Finally, they teach kids the valuable life lesson of trying new things. Most teens are just trying to figure out who they are before being thrown into the life of adult hood. For many, however, they don't want to identify as the average teen who sits in a classroom all day. It is important to give students things like extracurricular activities so they can celebrate what makes them unique. Extracurricular activities aren't just a club or a group of people, it is an outlet to be yourself. ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
8814CF59BC3B,"""Ughhhh,"" said Generic_Name, ""I am so bored, I wish I can do something fun right now!"" Generic_Name complained. Generic_Name had just gotten home from school and has nothing to do. Generic_Name goes downstairs and asks his mom about what activities are available for him to participate in. ""Mom! I want to participate in a school activity! What should I do?"" Generic_Name questioned, ""well honey, there is always an activity group you can join at school,"" Generic_Name's Mom replied. ""I feel so lonely, maybe I can meet new people if I join a club or sport, dont you think so Mom?"" Generic_Name said, ""I would like to join our school soccer team, I think that I would also meet new people there,"" Generic_Name said, ""sure honey, I think thats the best idea ever!"" Generic_Name's Mom encouraged. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.

First, students would gain confidence in themselves. According to research, most students that participate in at least one school activity tend to be more self confident. For instance, my best friend, Generic_Name, that used to be my neighbor when I lived in Virginia, was very insecure about himself, and after he decided to join a school activity, he became very secure and confident about himself. Also, students that are self-confident tend to succeed more in life than those who are not. For example, Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft was very confident in himself, and that eventually led him to become one of the richest people living on planet Earth. Some may think that they do not need self confidence, but research says that everyone will eventually become miserable if not self-confident.

Second, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities. According to this, the explanation is that students can easily find what they are interested in for future purposes. For example, in the 1900s, my old math teacher, Generic_Name, did not like the subject math at all, and once he joined an after school math club, he began to love math, and this is the reason of him becoming a math teacher. Also, such a small addition to your life can help you be a more organized person, and being organized will get you many opportunities in life. For instance, My friend, Generic_Name, was very disorganized and could not get a job, and once he learned to be organized, he got many high paying job offers. According to research, some may be satisfied with themselves being disorganized, but almost all become regretful of the act of not being organized during their life.

Third, students would not spend time alone. This means that students are not going to be alone, wasting their priceless time. For example, almost any elder you ask, will inform you that they wasted much of their time being alone from experience. Additionally, based off research, most people that spend time alone, usually are depressed and have a sad, gloomy personality. For instance, my old friend from Maryland, and was only 17, was a very depressed person after he stopped attending his high-school after school activities during 2012. Some groups may occupy a very depressing, and not attracting personality from genetics and think that it is permanent, but research informs that even such little additions to your life like school activities can greatly change that.

Imagine, you have just made your high-school soccer team. You come home, and open your ajar door to your well organized room that has a very welcoming smell. You have many good friends from your amusing and attracting personality, and always have something fun to do. Your a great, wise person that everyone looks up to and you have a very open mind. You are getting offers for scholarships and many other mouth-watering opportunities. Overall, your life is great from such a little addition to it.

B1E4B9C99415,"A famous basketball player once said ""I never wanted to do sports. Until i tried something new."" I agree all students should have to participate in a type of school activity. It would help kid arent outgoing make friends,it gives kid something to put on there collage applications,shows them a good time,and give them something to talk about.

First of all,students that would be considered shy might need a push to make friends. Maybe putting them in a uncomfortable situation would open their minds into something they would not have expected. Maybe your a 'new kid' in town and really dont have friends but, you really like Volleyball or Basketball and the school requires you to play you now have people who likes the same things as you.

furthermore, it gives them something to write on collage applications .collage people love reading about you when you played volleyball or seeing that you were sons school council. you could use that as your collage easy. and if you do a sport is would act as a scholarship if you play you cold go to collage and not have to pay money and things of that nature.

Another key factor, it gives you something to talk about. maybe your not a great conversation starter and you need help. and is great conversation to have with people how dont know what b they want to do and you have something to talk with your teammates about like ""that was a great game ""

Another reason it it gives you a great experiences meaning learn and in general they get a good out looking on different things. For example the learn That they do not like basketball and soccer you still have these skills that you learned while your figuring out you dont like that activity..another example if you some a a famous writer your books can be based off of many different things you activities you did as a child.

In conclusion as a student i believe that you should participate in a school activity. It would help kid arent outgoing make friends,it gives kid something to put on there collage applications,shows them a good time,and give them something to talk about. if you dont play sports now in the future you will regret it .                       ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
E7B411F1D446,"Should the principal be allowed to force decisions on their students? While this may lead to some poor decisions, it would be better in the long run. ""Why?"" you say, you see 70% of kids don't do social or physical activities of any kind, and suffer as a result. There are also a lot of times where kid's are forced to do something new and then end up liking it. Something they never would have done they liked. Along with that, putting kid's through these programs could also give them valuable life skills. Overall, I do think that the principal, or whoever is managing the school, should be allowed to force these programs upon kids.

My first point I'm going to list is that it get's them doing something. Like I said a lot of kids don't do anything by themselves, and around 2/3 of them have less than three friends. There is a whole outside world waiting for them. It is also noted that these kids more often than not have great talents, which are just waiting to shine. With a stronger school, getting them to go outside, and participate in activities such as clubs, school teams, and the student council would be easy and beneficial, and some of these benefits would be stronger and smarter kids, and more school funding for these programs.

The second reason I think this should be done, is because of practical reasons. The goal of the school is to cram as much as they can into the student before the year's end. They could also set up after school activities straight after school to do this even better, along with this would help students who don't have parents or guardians at home. Whether this would be mandatory or not is one sided, it must be mandatory. Another practical reasons this should be done is that it would allow more time for the teacher and student to interact helping with the normal school day and settling any problems.

One thing other people might say is that it would increase costs, and that the school shouldn't be messing with the student's childhood. Both of those accusations are wrong. Doing these has been shown in several studies to not be very expensive, and is literally just a step up from end of day clubs. The second point isn't true either, the school is a part of the student's childhood, and they should be embracing it. Younger generations haven't learned what and what not to do yet, and the school can help them decide.

In the end, I do think that the principal should be able to force activities like these upon the students, to improve their live skills, and maybe provide a bit of fun. Of course, the United States is a republic, so it all depends on the parent's, but I do think they will agree with what I say, that children shouldn't be sitting in their bed all lazy, but be making important life choices.

Now what do I think you think of this? Even if you are just a student, and not a parent of teacher who already knows all the benefits, it is for your personal future, and it will be better for you.

The first reason why is. We already have enough to do at school is because, we have to do 5 SOLS, 2 for English, 1 for math, 1 for civics and economics, and 1 for science. We already have to have 4 blocks a day. We just don't need anymore classes.

The second reason is. We don't need to stay in school longer than we have to because, we already spend around 7 hours in school. Our second block is way to long. We don't have enough time to get to our next class when we have A lunch because the main set of stairs is blocked off.

The last reason is. We already hate being in this school because, one of the light protectors in the gym is hanging down. The school pizza has a lot of grease on it. There is a fight happening almost everyday.

Certain students in the classroom like to get extra credit for college or high school that requires a lot of harder questions increased hours of homework and bigger vocabulary these students some students are overwhelmed as it is adding an extra activity would limit their school work and stretch them thin.

When a student is at school the principal the teachers control what they are allowed to do and where they allowed to do it for 7 hours Monday through Friday. The Students Need some time away from the school. a lot of kids do not even like coming to school if they had another activity forced on them by the school they would skip more. The students wont like to have thing crammed into their schedule by school staff.

Not everyone has same amount of money some people have rich parents some people have poor parents everyone wishes that they had the richest parent but they are just doing their best. Some kids are forced to do thing they dont want to because they dont have enough money to do what they want like i wanted to play hockey with old bu i cant cause i am not rich enough but someone whos even poorer than me is super limited to his extracurricular activities and they will spend hours doing something they dont like

Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Do you agree or disagree with this decision?""

Extracurricular activities are some ways that students use their free time after school. On average, about 65% of all in students in Virginia participate in a extracurricular activity such as a sport, club etc.. I think that all students should participate in one extracurricular activity because it will help students with their college applications, students can find new interests, and students can meet new people.

Firstly, it will help students have a better, stronger, college application. Extracurricular activities are a strong factor on college applications. According to one of the admission officers at Harvard University,

""students are 10x more likely to get into an ivy league or higher ranked university, if he/she has more extracurriculars on their application.""

Many colleges like to see extracurriculars on an application, rather than not.

Second, students are gonna be able to find new interests. Students are more likely gonna find their passion for something if they do an extracurricular. Helping students find their passion in something can help them take classes with their interests and help them improve in that skill set required for their passion. In my experience, having extracurriculars helped me find interest for many of the things I love today.

Lastly, extracurricular activities can help students meet new people. Meeting new people is probably the best part of doing extracurricular activities. Extracurriculars are good for students to meet others that share the same interests as them. For example students who tend to be more quieter and to themselves can have an easier time opening up to new people they've met if they like the same thing, and this can lead to them creating lifelong friendships with them.

Conclusively, helping students with their college applications, students finding their passion, and helping students meet new people are reasons why principals should require an extracurricular activity amongst all students. These extracurriculars can benefit a students school, and social life in a positive way. Requiring students to do an extracurricular of their interest can lead them to enjoying arriving and being at school more than before. Extracurriculars can also highly affect a students future in many positive ways.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
52228E95FAC5,"Generic_Name closes his eyes as the teacher thunders her way towards him. She finally arrives with a hungry smile and cruel eyes and says,""Generic_Name did you do your homework?"".""No i did not teacher because I had no time due to the outrageous rule that the principal made that made it mandatory that all students participate in one extracurricular activity."" Her eyes gleamed with anticipation as she gave Generic_Name an F and walked off to seek her next victim. The rule that dictates that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity is a mutiny and should be abolished at once because,students can use the extra time for more beneficial uses such as doing their homework or catching up on some sleep,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will not benefit them.

The first reason why the rule that states that you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be nullified is,that students can use the extra time for more productive purposes such as doing homework or catching up on some sleep. When i was younger I used to participate in writing club and when I would come back home I would be drained. I would have no energy to do anything so the majority of the time my assignments went incomplete and turned into zeros. One day the teachers started noticing the lack of turned in assignments and called my parents for a parent teacher conference. the teachers brought me and my parents to a table wearing serious expressions. The teacher said,""Your son has displayed superior thinking skills but the lack of turned in assignments astounds us."" My parents replied by saying,""Our son gets back everyday from writing club extremely tired and does not have the time or energy to do his homework."" they came to a conclusion to cancel writing club for me and then I started turning in my homework on time. 44 percent of homework is not completed due to lack of time. If you say that they can do their homework when they get home after the extracurricular activity I would say that kids are not fully developed adults yet and dont have as much energy or stamina and cannot function after long periods of time.

The second reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be abolished is,that schools do not specialize in what club or sport that they offer and they will not teach it as well as the facilities that specialize in what they are offering. Its not the schools job to provide extra clubs they can offer clubs but they should not be able to force you to join a club. If a child wants to play a sport or endorse an activity, he can go to an outdoor club or facility that specializes in what the child wants to do. When i was eleven years old,I played on my school soccer team. The coach did not know how to play soccer and I hated it. I never got any better and I almost quit soccer then and there,but I went home one night and told my mom about it. She said,""You should try UCLA Soccer I read about it it's very interesting"". I tried it out the very following week it was amazing,I loved it and,I have been playing soccer ever since. If you say that the school clubs can also be good at teaching what they do I would tell you that a school club will never be as good at teaching a sport or activity than an actual facility that specializes at the given sport or activity.

The third and final reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activities must be abolished is,that if you force the kids to choose from a limited set of sports and clubs they might not like any of the activities that you are offering and because of that they will never practice what they are being taught and will never get better at what they are being taught. If a person does not like what they are being taught 98 percent of the people will not practice the subject or sport they do not like. If you dont practice what you are being taught you will never get better at what you are practicing and will never succeed at it. My cousin used to play karate and he hated it he would always pass the tests but he would never practice and as a black belt some of the blue belts that practiced were stronger than him. One day his mom asked him""Why arent you as good as some of the other students""? He replied by saying,""I dont enjoy karate like I used to and as a result,I don't practice anymore"".

If you say that people at school can like the subject or sport they are being taught I would say that is the reason extracurricular activities should be offered but not forced.

Generic_Name smiles at the teacher as she comes by ""Do you have your homework she asks""?""Yes ma am.""he replies with a grin. Ever since the rule that made extracurricular activities mandatory got abolished he has had time to finish all of his assignments and still had a little time for relaxation. I disagree with the principal's rule that every student has to participate in an extracurricular activity because students can use the time for more beneficial purposes,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will not benefit them.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Participating on one activity can also be entertainment , but some student thinks one activity is not enough for them. In my opinion, participating in one extracurricular activity is termenously and entertainment for students.

Frist, participating in one extracurriclar activity can help students on their others subjects or doing their other school work. For example, if students particpates in more than one activity they can not focus on their other subject like math, doing thier homeworks and studing for thier tests. In addtion for students to focus or particpate on thier other subject is better for them to participate in one activity.

Next, particpateing in one activity have a great impact on students. For example they can lrean new things and they can see how much distinguished are they on that activity. All activity are not easy some are diffcult and some of them are easy but we have to try our best.

Furthermore, students should particpate in one extracurriclar activity because they can complete their work on time. Another reason why is tremendously way for students to participate in one activity is it can help them to persuade a successful place in futuer.

For example students are lucky to have one extracurriclar activity in porfusly schools student have more than two activity which is not good for them they can not complete thier work on time because of so much school work.

I believe that participating in one extracrricual activity is a magnificent and better way for students.

participateing in one extracurriclar activity can help students to focuse on thier other school works. It also help students to participate on only one actiity for example like sports students can put all their focus on only one activity.

Its a great deal for students should to participate on one activity because they can complete thier work on time. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
C024BE77795B,"Middle school is supposed to have more freedom to pick and choose for classes,and clubs. If the principal says we must pick an extracurricular activity, it would take away the sense of freedom to choose. So i'm going to voice my opinion that it's our choice,also it makes the principal look bad,and that it takes away our own time.

We came to this school because its gives us more freedom to choose than elementary school. Now the choice seem more like a duty and make this experience less interesting. If I had to pick a extracurricular activity it feel like a normal class not a fun hobby or an interest. Then when i get a job using the skill from an extracurricular activity I most likely hate my job.

It also not so good towards the principal. It would make me feel forced and oppressed to do this activity. I'd feel obliged or it feel like a chore more than fun and intriguing. The principal look like a tyrannical ruler to the students.

Also it called

EXTRA

curricular activities. Infecense on extra which means not reqiured or more time. It should be our own time to use however we want and not to be consumed by these

EXTRA

curricular activitys. If I have practive of the same day as the

EXTRA

curricular activity and it cuts into my practice time do stay so my grade not effected or do I go and work on my dream/goals

So im hoping after this you will let us choose and make our own decisions.

DB9DFF9D847C,"Every school contains extracurricular activities, from sports to clubs to the student council. These after school activities were created to entertain those students who wanted to learn or have fun with others while in a safe and comfortable environment. Although most schools don't force participation, it would be extremely beneficial if they did as extracurricular activities teach how to cooperate with others, allow students to explore things out of their comfort zone and meet new people and shows the crucial importance of time management.

Learning teamwork and cooperation with your peers is an important thing to learn all throughout middle and high school. Being on a sports team or in a competitive club can show students how to work with each other and communicate accordingly. For instance, when on a sports team like volleyball, teamwork is essential. Each member plays an important role but that role cannot be correctly executed unless the other members are assisting. The hitter depends on the setter to give a sturdy and high set in order to spike the ball and score a point, and the setter relies on the defensive line to give a high and straight pass in order to provide a good set. Communication and cooperation with one another is vital and can overall teach the players many lessons and prepare them for the future.

Furthermore, extracurricular activities can also allow students to get out of their comfort zone to learn new things and meet new people. Schools contain numerous different clubs, one for each different crowd a student might fall into. There might be a club for music, books, movies, the environment, writing, or science and math, etc. Making sure students must participate in one of these clubs or activities can give them the push they need to realize a hobby they might not have known they had or meet a new friend they would have never talked to outside of the club. When I was new to my school, I didn't know anyone to well but once I joined cooking club, I learned many new things while participating and met brand new students too.

Although some might argue that they might not have time for this after school activity because of homework or chores, this decision made by the school can give students the chance to work on their time management. Time management is one skill that is very hard to achieve but is used almost all throughout your life. Managing school work, with the extracurricular activity, and whatever else they might have at home can allow students to work on this skill and apply it to real life.

The decision stating that all students must participate in extracurricular activities can overall help them when it comes to their future. Giving these students the opportunity to socialize with peers and enjoy themselves can benefit them in too many ways to count, educating them and further preparing them for what's to come after high school and even after college as well. The countless different clubs and teams can allows them to learn to cooperate with others, learn and meet new people and practice their time management skills.          ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
9DEE651A7219,"Our principle has decided that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity. Students can serve as student council, work on the yearbook, or even play a sport. I think this is a good idea or way for kids to express themselves. Here are some reasons why I agree with being apart of the activities.

One thing you can do is work on the yearbook. You can also open up and help motivate others. Participating in something helps with many skills such as, communication and working with others. The yearbook could even have anonymous writers, if you want to say something and don't want everyone knowing who said it. Also taking photos of other activities around the school would even be great.

Another extracurricular activity you could do is serving as student council. If you want to see changes in somethings you can step up and work as a council to make a difference. You could also get groups to hang up motivational quotes around the school. Sometimes, even having funds to raise money for the school would be a helpful idea.

You can also play sports to participate in an activity. Playing sports gives you the time for you make new friends, do what you love, and even hang with your bestie. Finding a sport you like can be hard but giving it your all is the best you can do. You can even get scholarships to colleges. And being on a team is your best suport group, they are always there when you need them.

In conclusion, I agree we should be in extracurricular activities. It gives us the opportunity to express our self and have fun doing it. They can also help try and change things to make a difference. The activities also have benefits for us and for school. All of these are reasons why we should participate in extracurricular activities.       ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A13EFC8CC12D,"Students should at least do one type of extracurricular activity because it will help them learn new things about their selfs, entertain them, and make new friends.

Doing an extracurricular activity can help the students learn new things about their self. For an example I have always thought basketball was a boring and pointless sport but when I saw others playing in this sport I ended up giving it a chance and started playing this sport. I eventually started to like this sport but it took some time getting use to, now it's the only thing I can think about all day. If the students learn new things about their self they will become more comfortable with themselves and whenever someone asks a question about what they like or whats their favorite sport they dont have to go ""Uhm, I am not really sure I dont know what I really like"".

Another reason students should do an acitivity is because they need to be entertained. Most students get really bored and have nothing to do in their extra time and when students have extra time they just sit around and complain how that there is nothing to do but if a student does a extracurricular activity they will engage in much more activites and not be as bored than before.

Another good reason for students to do an extracurricular activity is so they can make new friends, some students find it hard to make friends and find it hard to social with others; but if the students join a activity they will get use to being with others and be social more with others and the students will be out of their shell and will be their selfs around others.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
6A62CD23AF8B,"Seven hours per day for five days a week and some students have activities to do after school, along with that students have mountain high piles of homework nightly. Some couldn't fathom the amount of stress that students are under today. For those reasons, a principal adding a mandatory extracurricular activity is understandable, yet unrealistic.

Seven hours of school for five days is a very large amount of time spent on academics, but some students also do sports, tutoring, or some other activity after school in the very minimal time they have. Students who participate in sports may have been doing it all their life, so adding an extracurricular could possibly affect their sports schedule. Other students may be struggling with an aspect of school and they go to tutoring for that reason. Adding an extracurricular could interfere with the help they need to succeed.

Starting from age seven students are asked to do homework. When students are seven and in 1st grade they may not have a large amount of homework; however, when students are in high school the quantity will only grow. While some homework may not take much time for one student, another student may struggle with the assignment. For those reasons, it would be hard to expect much of a student if they also have to participate in an extracurricular.

Plenty of studies have shown that this past generation of students have the the largest amount of stress scientist have seen in years. Whether that stress comes from bullying, home life, school work, mental health, or high expectations, stress is unsettling high in students of all ages. Middle school student worry about the transition to high school, and high school students worry about their transition to college. All students worry, even if those worries are irrational, they are still stressed. That is why adding an extracurricular could be too much to ask of students.

Overall, extracurricular activities being mandatory sounds wonderful and has many pros as well, but when people look closer they realize that it would end up as a train wreck. Extracurricular activities should stay optional for those students who have the time and the energy to do their absolute best.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
3CA8BC5FDD12,"My principal has decided that students should do at least on extracurricular activity. I disagree with this because i think that students can do what they feel like doing and not be forced into something.

This will probably change a lot of things. We will be forced to do sports some students dont't like sports either they're not fit for it or they just don't like sports at all. Some people might want to work on there yearbooks but not everyone gets yearbooks. The student council i don't feel like any student would really want to do it.

Because what will it be about what will they say they might hurt or say something a student does not want to hear.

Sports what will they will have to do and what they will need. In sports you have to have the equipment your so pose to have for that sport. It could be Baseball, Football, Basketball or Soccer and whatever sport there is chosen for that student. Most sports you have to do conditioning so you have to run a lot and some people don't like running. Some people are not athletic and there just not good enough for sports. They might want to have a job and trying to go for what they want to do later in life. A lot of sports you can get seriously injured and some students might not want that to happen to them.

What is wrong with the yearbook. What are they going to do with the yearbook because all you have to do is set the students that took there picture in alphabetical order. What will they do when there done with It.

There not going to let a lot of people do it because you don't need half the school. Plus It's going to be hard if everyone wants to do the yearbooks.

What will they do with the student council. I don't think this is a good idea at all because hoe are they going to go threw the whole school for whatever they have to say to every individual student. It might take a while for a lot of students or it might be quick. It's going to be hard because some people are good and don't need it. I think these things are bad ideas.

I don't think this will be good because students want to focus on there education and to go for an higher future.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
8F2FCF066A81,"How many of us students want to be forced to do something? Probably not many. But, if it is for a good outcome, then maybe we should take into consideration that an extracurricular activity at school can be quite useful for the majority of us. If activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas are available, then many of our students would be intrigued with doing the activities that have been provided from our school principal and other faculty members. Since the decision has been made for all of the students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity from the principal, then maybe the decision for bringing new activities along with it will also be approved as well.

In the school that I am currently attending as of today, sports are an extremely big interest for quite a bit of students. Football, baseball, field hockey, and softball are just some of the sports that are mentioned from the different athletes that are streaming through the school's hallways every single day. Yes, there are already students doing sports anyways, but there are some students who have the perfect capabilities to do them, but they just do not put full effort into doing the sports. There are already plenty of different sport related activities through the schools, and it would be easy for these students to be included in doing the sport that they would be interested in, but all it takes is determination and full-on effort to make it happen.

With the already large number of performing and visually artistic students in the building, there are many different opportunities that newcomers may be able to do if they are just starting out. In the building we have a choral teacher, a drama teacher, and 2 art teachers, who are all extremely helpful, and are there for any questions that a curious student may have about the fine arts community and how to get interested. If more people get interested every year, then I am sure that making more activities that involve the community will be less of a challenge for the principal, and for others who are putting in to create ideas. If more students consider being in the fine arts community, then that would be a successful achievement for the school itself and our work may be recognized by even more people outside of the school as well.

In the day and age that we are all in as of right now, technology is at its finest point in time. With the addition of iPhone's, iPad's, Microsoft computers, and many more devices beyond that, we all have the ability to create different ideas and to make different extracurricular activities for all of the students who are interested in doing things with technology. As technology does grow every day, so should the amount of activities that we can do with it as well. Many students are in fact somewhat involved with technology and if the opportunity came along for them to have an in-school interaction with it, then they would maybe have a new hobby or a new interest that could help them in their own lives.

In conclusion, I do standby my principal's decision to have every student be involved in an extracurricular activity and I see why he is making it that way. If we add the activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas to the mix, then we will have a great lineup of the activities that the students can do. In the long run, these activitites may end up doing well for us all, and they could even put a great impression on our school.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
B3A7EA9C932B,"I agree with the principals decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, if the students don't do least one extracurricular activity, they won't know what they want to do when they'll become older and responsible for example, if a student did sports as one of their extracurricular activity, then maybe when they grow up, they would want to join a sports team or play a sport for a job or start a new carrier. Another example, one of the students choose two extracurricular activity, art and the other was learning about computers, that gives them more opportunities to see what they are going to do when they get older, they could do both, and have better job opportunities. At the age when your going into high school, you need to be focused in school and focused on your grades and choose a good extracurricular activity so you know what your going to be experiencing when you choose a job that you think will be good for you, and will enjoy. But if a student dosen't choose a extracurricular activity then they won't know what they'll do when they grow up and get older. they probably wont have a good job because they didnt choose a extracurricular activity when they should have in high school.

BF1212223916,"I disagree with the decision that all students must participate in an extra curricular activity. Maybe the reason that some students don't actively participate in those activities is because they have conflicts or cannot afford to participate. However it is good for a student to get activity in a day or do something fun with their brains. Students playing sports or being in clubs is good but not all kids have the luxury to be involved with those things.

Here are the three reasons why I think that students should not be forced to participate in an after school activity. One, some students may have serious conflicts that prevent them from doing an activity, such as taking care of relatives and siblings. Two, some students may not be able to afford being on the team and paying for jerseys or not be able to purchase a camera for yearbook club. Three, some students just may not want to do it. Maybe they would rather just go home and draw or do something by themselves, and not with other people.

However there are two benefits from making this rule. One, making students participate in an extra curricular activity could introduce the kids to something new, that they might really enjoy. Two, participating in one of these activities such as sports or a club helps activate different parts of their brain which they probably wouldn't get in school.

I think that the principal could also make it so if a student had a good enough reason that they couldn't or didn't want to partake in an activity then they wouldn't have to. And if a student really wanted to do something but had a conflict, then the principal could try and make time for them.

In conclusion I disagree with the decision to make students participate in an activity. If they couldn't then they can't and the principal can't really do anything about that. And if a student didn't want to then they shouldn't be forced into something they don't want to do. Even though there are a few benefits, I still think that it would be better if this was not a rule.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
2913843F6DE1,"I agree with having students do extracurricular activities after school, I feel like it would be a good idea to have not every student but, students that will participate involved in some of the extracurricular activities. This could help the students that get into bad things outside of school do better for themselves.

I feel that the students would have fun and would enjoy their time doing the activities provided for them. I agree with students participating in extracurricular activities but, I don't think every student should be involved in the activities for the simple fact, all students do not participate in the activities, in my opinion the activities the principal is providing for the students should be a privilege.

I think one of the activities should be homework club, for the students that need to catch up on work that is pass due or things the students may need help on. Without good grades us students shouldn't be able to have the privilege to be participating in the fun things until our grades are better.

We should have different things for the activities so everyone can try new things, in case they never seen it or tried it and end up liking one of the activities provided.

Another reason i agree is that, some of the students like being after school instead of going home or maybe the students that are going through things at home can stay and do the activities and have fun, I have a list of things that i think would be good activities for students such as basketball football step team/dance team music/rap/sing band practice soccer softball/baseball acting

The activities should be a fun experience but also a learning experience, the students should have fun and learn from it as the have fun doing the activities.

0E5434B8EA66,"Extracurricular activities, which are activities you can participate in and enjoy the things you would want to do after school such as sports, writing, and any after school activities your school can offer for the students. You're able to choose when and which after school activities you want to go too, but should every student be obligated to participate in extracurricular activities. Why students shouldn't be obligated to take part of an extracurricular activity. After school activities are something you should enjoy and not something to be forced to do and here's why. Some students might have a lot of stuff going on while they aren't at school. Students might also not like participating in after school activities due to no interest in the activities. Possibly students could see extracurricular activities as more stressful than fun.

A students' time after school could be very valuable and partaking in after school activities could always be very time consuming. Sure after school activities could be an hour or two but what if a student has other important things to do out of school. A student could be participating into other activities like sports and might not have time to do homework or study and on top of that being obligated to stay after school. A student might also have pets or siblings to take care of, which would be more important than an after school activity. An obligated extracurricular activity would just be time consuming and might not fit into a students' schedule. The school should understand that students also need time at home because seven hours of learning in school is as already as hard as it is, and then having to go to an after school activity would just make the situation even worse.

There could also be no after school activities a student might have interest in. Some students might have interests that the after school activities doesn't offer them. Even if it's just working on the school year book, an after school activity must be something a student should enjoy after school, not just being forced to do extra work. Just like anything you would want to do, you would participate and join it because you wanted to, and not because of obligation or force too. Just forcing a student to stay after school for something they don't want to do would just make the student dislike school even more. Students should enjoy doing what they want after school which might not even be an extracurricular activity.

Stress would also partake in students having to be obligated to stay after school for extracurricular activities. After a long day at school students would just want to head home and relax from school. Worrying about having to stay after would just cause the student to be more stressed. What if a student didn't have a ride to get back home from after school activities or they were scared of being at school longer, then what would they do in that situation? In case these situations happen what should the solution be? Well since these issues could happen from obligation of partaking in an extracurricular activity, then the only solution should be that after school activities should not be obligated and only stay optional for the better.

Why students shouldn't be forced to participate after school activities. There are many reasons why a student shouldn't be obligated to participate in after school activities and why it should stay optional. Staying after school could stress a student out due to obligation of staying at school for an hour or two more. A student can have other things they do outside of school that after school activities can take time away from it. A student might even dislike the activities at the school and would not enjoy their time of staying after school which is the opposite of what after school activities are about. Staying after school is something that's optional and something you can enjoy doing. All concluded which is the reason why school activities shouldn't be a must.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
C6BB30D4C189,"A few weeks ago, a priest said to me, ""Go the second mile."" That sentence really hit me. I asked myself if I was giving back to the world as much as the world gave me. I'm sure you know that going the second mile means don't do the minimum, go above and beyond. I thought adding this short story would be important because sometimes kids just wanna do the minimum of going to school and then going home. I think that every kid should do at least one extracurricular activity because they can help you succeed with your academic life, do exercise, and have fun.

First, I think that extracurricular activities can help you succeed with your academic life. For example, you can go to a math club if that is what you need help with. This demonstrates that doing extracurricular activities can help you do better on a subject. For instance, you can get help from your teacher or coach on a subject that they might know more than you about. This shows that extracurricular activities can be a way to get more help on subjects you might need extra help with. Also, going to an extra class or activity can help you minimize your laziness by having not just to go there, but to complete the work you are given there too. My examples are all evidence of why extracurricular activities can help you do better on a subject.

Second, extracurricular activities can be a way to do exercise. For example, you can join a basketball team or soccer team. Joining any sports team would help you do exercise by playing with your teammates and practicing. For instance, you can join a math club, memory club, or any other type of academic club that can help you think and answer questions. This demonstrates that joining and academic club can help you exercise your brain by thinking and answering questions. Another way extracurricular activities can be a way to do exercise is by doing community service for your teachers. Doing community service like cleaning tables or organizing the library is a way to do exercise because you are constantly moving your arms and legs. In this paragraph I showed you how extracurricular activities can help you work your muscles and exercise your brain.

Finally, extracurricular activities can be a way to have fun. For example, you can hang out with your friends. Hanging out with your friends and doing an activity together can not only strengthen your friendship but also can be an excellent way to have fun. For instance, going to a basketball club or a club you really like can be an amazing way to have fun. This is because you get to do an activity that you love not just by your self, but with other people that love it too. Another piece of evidence that shows that extracurricular activities can be a way to have fun is by meeting new people and making friends. Meeting new people and making friends is always fun if you let it be, so it demonstrates that extracurricular activities are a really good way to have fun. Every piece of evidence I wrote here are excellent examples of why extracurricular activities can bring you joy and happiness.

In conclusion, I think that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can help you do better on a subject, help you work your muscles and brain, and bring you joy and happiness. Go try an extracurricular activity with your friends. In case you don't like the activities in your school, ask to make a new one. They are always worth the trouble.

F8C397108272,"I disagree because it would be hard for me to pick one extracurricular activity and not because their is so many but because their is not enough. Also because its hard for me to open up to new things besides sports and honestly i wouldnt know what to do.

reasons i wouldnt join would be because of how much time you will have to spend doing something you werent sure about doing in the first place but still having to do it because thats what you signed up for.

CA0D04C09E69,"Imagine that you have started going to a newly built school and the school system has decided to set aside money to fund for extracurricular activities and sports. Your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity or sport. Do you agree with this? Personally, I believe that students should not have to participate for a few reasons: These activities can cause students to become injured or sick, they cost money and can take time out of a parents work day.

As we know, sports and other activities can be fun, but they also come with risks. Students can become injured or sick. If a student becomes injured, they may need medical attention or maybe even a surgery to help them get back to normal. This may also affect their daily life because they may need help carrying items or walking correctly. If a student is sick, they could spread it to other people or possibly affect their work in and out of school.

Our parents work very hard to make the money that they have. Extracurricular activities cost money, whether it is for a field trip or sports equipment. Unfortunately, many families in America don't make a lot of money and I see that as being another problem with the principle's decision. Field trips are also another fun part about extracurricular activities but some parents don't have enough money to send a child lunch to eat or even to be able to attend.

When it comes to work, our parents do a lot. They often will do anything to provide for their family. For example : A mom works double jobs to be able to provide basic needs for her kids and pay the bills every month. When students have sports or extra activities, this can cause them to have to leave work early for pick up or have to work over time for missing it.

Extracurricular activities and sports are not for everyone. In conclusion, this is why students shouldn't be required to participate in at least on extracurricular activity or sport because students can become injured or sick,the activities cost money and can take time out of a parents work day. Adults work very hard to provide for their kids and spend time with them.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
37D4CF70BB56,"Should students participate in an extracurricular activity? Probably so, it'll be beneficial to them.

I think that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it'll give them a new experience, they'll meet new people, and depending on the activity, it can help them develop their future.

An after school activity can give you a new experience, but how? Sometimes, you might not know exactly what you like, so an extracurricular activity could help you learn more about yourself. I mean, even if you dont like it you'll know not to do it again, right? Besides learning more about yourself, trying something new can just be good for you, especially if what you're doing is a sport or something that'll develop your future. Well, maybe your friends might want to brag to others that they were on the football team when they graduate. A sport or even an art activity could help you if you're applying to a job, but it would also give you, in a way, work experience, especially if you're applying to a job that is related to that activity when you're older. Even if you might not like the activity, it will be beneficial to you at some point.

Meeting new people can benefit students. Sometimes, you might not have many friends who have the same hobbies, but when you're joining an activity, especially if it's something that you like, there's bound to be people that have the same hobbies. Who knows, maybe you might find a really good friend there. Meeting new people can make connections, connections are good to have when you're older and you might have a specific job to do. Maybe you might just need something and you remember your friend from that activity became a pretty great manager of a popular company. Usually, when you're joining an extracurricular activity, there's going to be people who are older than you and they have more experience in the activity you might've joined, it would be helpful to you to learn what they have been taught. It's good to learn from other perspectives, don't you think? Making new friends and meeting new people could ease stress with coming up tests, they'll help you relax a little more.

Well, what if students don't want to participate? It can be difficult for a student to participate if something is happening outside of their school life. Sometimes, students might not be able to participate because of family, work, money, or time. There's a point in time where they will have to make exceptions. Besides that, usually it seems like the students around here might not do much outside of school, so they'll be kept a little busy with an activity.

My final thought is that, of course, students should participate because they'll meet new friends, maybe even learn some new skills, and develop themselves and their future. So, go ahead and join an activity, you could really learn from it!",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
7A5DBFF57812,"Imagine you are at your high school graduation, your name gets called up and every one in your grade chants your name. You have came far for this opportunity to go to a top notch university. You would think that it was all of your teachers that helped you. But then you forget about your Math and Science Olympiad coaches, your basketball coach. I believe that schools need extracurricular activities. If my principal told made a rule that every one single one of the kids had to do a extracurricular activity, I would most likely sign up in at least two or three activities. The reasons why I think this are, You can learn Important life skills, you gain knowledge of things you didn't know before academically, and it can sometimes be fun.

My first reason why you should have these activities were that you can learn a bunch of life skills that would very useful in the future. Like teamwork. Teamwork is a very important skill you need to learn. In the future when you get a job. You will need to work with your coworkers. Sometimes you know your coworker an other times you will get paired with someone you will not know. It is always very important to know how to work with other and communicate with them when necessary. My second example is that it teaches time management. When I was in Odessy of the Mind, I had little to know time to do my homework. So I would do my homework at school and not worry about it when I would get home. This is why so you can just chill in you home or do other priorities. Third and final example is Responsibility. Let's all be honest. We all learn responsibility when we were very young. I learned it before I started Preschool. I will give you an example on why responsibility is so important. You are playing football. You are the center. Your job is to snap the ball to the quarterback and block the big defensensive tackles and linebacker. If you don't do you are responsible for, then the quarterback will get tackled for a lose of yards, or he will get hurried to throw the ball and will throw a bad pass. This is why this skill is so important. You need to what your job is and how to do it.

My second reason why you should have these activities is that you gain knowledge academically. When you go to a extracurricular activity to do with math or science, you will learn new things from an academical standpoint. Take math for an example. Let's say you are in 6th grade. You are talking an after school math advanced math class. Your teacher teaches you the Quadratic Formula. Look at you now, you are in 6th grade and you know how to do quadratics. Also, take science for an example. They teach you a ton of things, maybe you are in 7th grade and talking an extracurricular class of physics. Great job, now you know what a black hole is. Okay, my last example is that you are in student council, now you know how to stand up and talk to people and know how rules get passed. I could list hundreds of examples. But you can only do this if you have a positive mindset and be there only if you want to be there.

My third and final reason is that you actually have a lot of fun. If you play a sport such as football and basketball, you get excited and have a ton of fun, Sometimes when in an extracurricular class, you have fun time learning new things that you are interested in learning. You can sometimes have a lot of fun and learn things academically to. You can reduce stress and anxiety, and it can exercise your brain. So from an entertainment standpoint. Extracurricular activities are really good.

Well I believe that Extracurricular activities are very useful and great de to these three reasons, They teach you very important life skills, they teach you things from an academical standpoint, and the third and last reason was that they are really fun. Extracurricular activities are no classes that you have to get an A on. They are classes the you inquire knowledge out of. They are their to give you the knowledge that you need.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
323528BC0FDB,"""well not all people like to do other things."" Joining a different activity is not what a lot of people like to do very much. Kids dont really talking in front of a lot of people because they could be shy or anything. When kids do a extracurricular activity they could agree with people and disagree with people because everyone don't have the same opinion. So I disagree because some could get hurt doing sports , they go visit family and they don't have time to do anything and people is not an out door person and don't talk that much.

Kids could get hurt doing sports , like I was younger at my dad football practice and a boy pop his bond out of place so they call the ER and he had to get things done. Most kids hurt they self though out the year when they're doing sports because they could of been doing things wrong so they hurt themselves. Most people don't like going outside and doing that much activity or like playing sports. A lot of kids like to be healthy if they going to play a sports or anything and they keep their body in shape. Students shouldnt have have participate in a activity if they dont want to and i dont thing they should get force too if they dont want to do it at all.

Most kids don't often go and visit they family so some kids go on trips and visit they family if they don't see them and things. It's good that kids go see they're family, also and kids are shy, they don't talk to people or they're not an outdoor person so they stay in the house and don't talk to no one. It would take up kids time if they want to go visit they family so I think kids should go visit they family if they don't see them that often and if they want to spend time with them. Most people worry about they family so they don't have time to go visit their family that much. Like my family that live far but not that far away from me i would go visit them and still be in things.

Even tho kids are not an outdoor person or dont talk to that much people it they still dont have to do something they dont want to. Kids dont like staying after school for sports or anything only if its something fun and your helping out thats what kids like to do. Doing something could help but students shouldn't have to just do it if they dont want to and its theyre choice if they want to do it or not they dont have to get force to. A lot of kids just dont talk or nothing and they don't do nothing but talk to they friend or stay in the house and not do nothing. Most kids dont even have that much friends they could do or nothing so most kids dont do after school activitys.

Kids just don't go outside or don't do something because they could get hurt or anything. Most kids love doing an activity with their school and then other kids just dont like doing something at all. So I disagree because kids shouldnt have to do something they dont want to do if its in school or out of school. They also dont have to be/get force to do anything. A lot of other kids are like teachers pet and do a lot for teachers and even help out with a lot of teacher with a lot of things . Kids are shy to even do extracurricular activity like help with year books , do sports or anything, most kids dont even see their family like they'er opposite to so kids dont do other activity or sports like that.             ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
6A62A748E4F0,"Do you agree or disagree that all students must be part of an extracurricular activity? Well i believe that all students must be part of an extracurricular activity because it creates bonds and builds teamwork skills.

Extracurricular activities create bonds by forcing students to join with one another in a group project so they will make friends among the group. Students will be able to further improve their passion for the activity for example I found out about the D&D club at my school I went to one of their sessions and found out that I really had a passion for the game, I am still enjoying it to this day.

Extracurricular activities build teamwork skills by making students work together to get a task done. For example when I was in D&D me and my group were in a forest when we saw a dead horse on the road two of my teammates were squinting to try and see the details, another one of my teammates was booking it to the horse to try to see what happened and I'm just standing their thinking to my self what are these nut jobs doing then suddenly the teammate who was booking it got jumped by goblins I forced a fire bolt at one of the goblins, one of my other teammates is playing ping pong with his short bow, another one puts a knife in a goblins back, the paladin smashes his hammer on one of them, and the wizard throws acid at one we took them all out but the one who booked it died the end.

What should have been taken away from this is that being part of an extra curricular activity helps make bonds and encourage teamwork skills, do you agree or disagree that studets must be in a extracurricular activity.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
806A8C08ADF7,"Generic_Name hauled his bag over his shoulder and trudged down the hallway. His feet dragged behind him and he hunched a little more with each step. It was decided that students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, even if they didn't have an interest in it. Generic_Name had wanted to be on the robotics team, but the positions filled up quickly due to the new policy. Therefore, Generic_Name's alternative was joining the football team. He had to purchase a bunch of equipment and then carry a large bag around every day. His friend, Generic_Name, came up to him in the hallway and asked, ""Are you on your way to football practice?"" ""Unfortunately,"" Generic_Name mumbled back. Generic_Name wasn't bad at football, he just didn't enjoy playing it. Generic_Name knew of several athletes who had wanted to be on the football team, but couldn't because too many people who didn't want to participate signed up. ""How's the student council?"" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name. ""I hate it. I wanted to be apart of the school newspaper, but there were no more positions by the time I signed up,"" Generic_Name responded. This was the scenario for many students. They were pressured into choosing a sport or club that they didn't have an interest in. Students who were interested in participating, didn't enjoy it as much because those who didn't want to participate hindered the progress of others. Generic_Name and Generic_Name didn't have the luxury of personal activities after school anymore because they were both forced into extracurricular activities that weren't interesting to them. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it takes away from other students' after school activities, it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate, and it wouldn't be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.

The first reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would take away from other students' after school activities. Students may be apart of out of school activities such as recreational basketball, a community robotics team, or a community service committee. Students would be forced to either drop out of these activities or jam their schedule due to the required addition of an extracurricular activity. Also, some students may have after school responsibilities such as walking their dog, meeting a sibling on their way home, or preparing dinner. These responsibilities would be interfered by an unnecessary impediment of disinterest. These extracurricular activities may not catch the interest of some students and take away from their other after school activities.

Another reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate. Students may see this as another activity they're being forced into participating in against their will. If a student is truly interested in an extracurricular activity, then they will sign up on their own. But making them participate won't be as beneficial as some may think. Imagine if you had to participate in a club or sport that didn't interest you in the slightest. Would you be fine with that? Some activities also require specific materials and supplies that aren't provided by the school. Some sports and clubs also require a student to carry around a separate bag or wear a specific item of clothing. These required activities can also increase the amount of stress put on students throughout the day. Being forced into choosing an extracurricular activity puts an unnecessary burden on students would don't wish to participate.

In addition to taking away from other after school activities and putting a burden on students who don't want to participate, this decision would also take away some of the enjoyment from students who do want to participate. When you're on a team, whether it's a sport or a club, you need to work as a team. If one person on your team isn't putting in his or her full effort or holding up his or her end, it makes the experience less enjoyable for those who do participate. Put yourself in their shoes for a moment. Would you want someone who's not going to work as hard as everyone else on your team? All it takes is a couple of people to ruin it for everybody else. Students who participate in a club because they're interested or desire a future profession in that area of expertise may find it bothersome and not as enjoyable if a student doesn't participate. If this decision were put into action, it would take away some of the enjoyment from the students who want to participate.

Generic_Name walked with a spring in his step towards the robotics room. When he arrived, he dropped his backpack and went straight to work. He enjoyed building and designing robots and was able to contribute to his team's effort because of his interest. Everyone else on his team had signed up because of their interest as well. As Generic_Name was arranging his tools, Generic_Name walked in behind him with a smile across his face. ""Guess what?"" Generic_Name asked as he flaunted a folded newspaper in his hand. ""What?"" Generic_Name replied curiously. ""I wrote an article on the importance of student choice in school, and the principal liked it so much that he appointed me head of the school paper!"" ""Congratulations, Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name said happily. Generic_Name turned and walked out of the class with excitement and said, ""See you later, Generic_Name."" Generic_Name turned towards the rest of his robotics team and began working. Since he had an intention on joining the team, Generic_Name was able to clear up his schedule after school so he could participate efficiently. Generic_Name felt relieved that he didn't have to carry around an extra bag and was satisfied by his team's effort. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it may take away from other students' after school activities, it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate, and it wouldn't be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
343084E34E9A,""" What are you going to choose?"" That is the sound of a student at a school which requires them to do an extra- curricular activity. Students enrolled at this school must do some sort of extra curricular activity, whether it is a sport, a spot on the yearbook club, or serving on the student council. I agree with the requirement of an extra curricular activity because it can help you find people with the same interests and lead you to new interests, it can help create a better community environment and it will help all the students mature and succeed in the future.

Participating in an after school activity can lead you to people that have the same interests and can lead you to other interests. i have been playing lacrosse for about 8 years now and as I've played throughout the years, I have discovered many different hobbies through my teammates such as cheer leading, track and field and rock climbing. I've also been able to make friends because I'm on a different team every season. I have made about 3 lifetime friends in lacrosse. I think this can happen with school lead activities. I think by being part of an after school activity, you can make lifelong friends, find people with the same interests and discover new hobbies.

Doing an after school activity can help create a better community environment. this kind of relate back to the previous statement about making friends.

by making friends, you can create less bullying. there is this saying, ""strength in numbers"", and I truly think this would happen with an after school activity requirement rule. By installing an activity requirement, you would help build a bully-free community.

Lastly, an after school activity would help students mature and prepare them for the future. I babysit a little boy with downs-syndrome and i often take him to the park. When we leave, you tell he is a little bit more mature from when we first arrived. this is because hen has played with older kids and have copied their actions. I believe this goes with all kids. if we had an after school activity program and we put all the grades together, it would help the younger one mature but also the older kids could teach them how to do things that they will need to know in the real world.

I think everyone should be involved in some sort of group, whether it be school related or not. Maturing kids, better community environments and finding new friends can all happen with a required after school activity program.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
146D260F5526,"Imagine your principal said you had to participate in some type of extracurricular activity, how would you feel?

Would you feel like you are being forced or unable to decide what you do in your life?

Well, for many students this is happening to them.

I disagree with this decision because, some students have things they have to do after school, its the students life and they should be in control of what they do, and some parents dont have the time nor the money to do extracurricular activities.

First, some students have things they must do after school, at home some parents leave things for their kids to do that may prevent them from doing extracurricular activities.

A parent relies on their kids to watch younger siblings so they dont get in trouble.

In the afternoon the students might have to go see or help a sick family member or friend.

Sometimes parents also leave lists of chores they expect the kids to be finished with before they arrive home, and its part of the kids responsibilities to get them done.

Also most teachers give out homework that the kids have to turn in next class, when these students have 6-8 classes and homework in most of then it may be hard to juggle anything else.

Secondly, its the students life and they should be in control of what they do.

Sometimes kids just dont want to do something, it may be because of social life or their life at home.

Its also their choice rather they want to do it or not, because its their mind and body.

only parents or guardians have the right to force their kids to do something, the school shouldnt be allowed to tell students they have to join extracurricular activities if the just dont want to.

Your only a kid once and these students should be able to enjoy their childhood without having to cut out time for extracurricular activities they they are being forced to do.

Lastly, some parents or guardians dont have the time or money to let their child participate in extracurricular activities.

Some parents only have enough money to pay the bills and keep foo on the table, they dont need to pay fees just so their child can participate in extracurricular activities.

The parent might not have the time off that they need to join the child in club meets or sports games, because they work long hours. Transportation may be a big issue, if the family has no way to get their child to the extracurricular activities then there is no need for the child to be forced to sign up for them.

Also club meet times, say if the parents live in the middle on nowhere and the kid has a club meet at five but the parents get off at seven the club times are not convenient for the family.

In conclusion, I disagree with this decision because, some students have things they have to do after school, its the students life and they should be in control of what they do, and some parents dont have the time nor the money to do extracurricular activities.

6A2AAAC00995,"Should students part take in a extracurricular? well I think all students should participate in extracurricular activities because, it gets students more involved with his or her community and keeps students active and on their feet. This will teach students many skills that could benefit them in the future.

First off, you can learn so many things off of joining or participating in a extracurricular. For example, joining a sport can teach a student leadership skills, listening skills, time management, teamwork, and many other skills that students could use for future use. Joining a sport discovered many things I didn't already know about myself. I learned my set limits, how to prepare myself for certain situations, and how being aware and proactive can effect me greatly, was a great learning experience for me. Therefore, you should give an extracurricular a try, maybe you'll enjoy it it a lot.

Next, Joining an extracurricular activity can get you more intertwined with your community and your school. This leading to building great relationships between others or making a new ones. For example, I joined the soccer team then soon to have met one of my best friends, they're the most supportive, kind, caring, and most definitely the funniest people i've ever ran into. That decision was one of the best choices i've ever made. In addition, You'll get to meet all kinds of people from around your community, learning more about them each day and everyday, how similar or how different they're from you. At the end of it, it is nice to see all different or similar types of people that are surrounding you in your daily life.

In conclusion, I think you should join an extracurricular because you can benefit so much off of it. Including many life skills that will help you such as, communication skills, leadership skills, listening skills and many more skills that will help you along your path.

AFDA24702118,"A lot of students do extracurricular activities if they are interested in them. Such as doing a sport or working on a year book. They are there for students to enjoy. So shouldn't we have a choice to join or not?

We shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities if we don't want to. What if your life is busy and you don't have time. A lot of students are already stressed about their regular classes and they are required to do an activity over top of everything?

I strongly disagree with students having to do an extracurricular activity. We shouldn't have to do something we are not interested in. All you should have to do at school is learn. A bunch of students could easily get stressed out from everything. I get easily stressed and I get a lot of homework. My life is really busy and being required to do an activity I am not interested in, can ruin my day.

Extracurricular activities are there for students to enjoy them and feel like they are apart of something. If we don't like the activity though, some problems might appear. With a tight schedule, doing an activity can leave student with no extra time. Students can go exhausted and come to school very tired. There would be too much to think about and students wouldn't be very happy in those classes/ activities.

We shouldn't have to do something if we don't want to. It would be annoying and tiring. We need to be able to have a choice to do them or not. Everyone have a different things they like to do. So yes, we should have a choice to do them or not.   ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
36456C81A55A,"To most students, school is like a black hole that they would do anything not to fall into. Kids go to school and sit for seven hours, and then go home and do almost the same thing. It's not healthy for them and it makes them dread school even more. Students are constantly falling asleep throughout the day because they don't have anything to look forward to, and that makes them feel as if school isn't as important as it is. If they don't have any fun, then they won't try in school whatsoever. If students are doing extracurricular activities, they'll be way more active and less tired throughout the day. I think that students should be required to do an extracurricular activity because it will get them involved in their school, it will keep them active in many ways, and they will learn more about everything around them.

First, Extracurricular activities will get students involved in their school. For example, they'll be representing their school. You're representing your school in any activity you pick, but you especially if you're playing a sport. Sports teams are like little families in the school, and the people playing on them love their teammates and love the place they're playing for. If all the kids are required to do an extracurricular, and get to choose to play a sport, they'll get to meet lifelong friends and be the face of their school. This can make students love school so much more than they used to. Next, they will also be just as involved in their school if they do an activity like yearbook. In yearbook, you're constantly learning about the kids in your school and all your surroundings. Most kids barely get to know half of the people in their grade, but if they're learning about the people around them, they can get to know almost everyone. Finally, it'll be a chance for them to make new friends. As I said, most students barely get to know everyone they go to school with, and a lot of times they're to shy to try to get to talk to new people. When they're put in a club or an after school activity, they learn how to communicate with others. Clubs could help so many people make new friends.

Secondly, it will keep students active in many ways. For instance, playing a sport would be very good for any and all students. Constantly moving and exercising would help them stay active and fit, which is good for everyone. Most of your years in school you are required to do physical education, but sometimes you're barely even moving during the class. Sports will keep kids much more active than any class could. Also, being involved in an activity like student council or yearbook would keep their brains running and being used. They would always be coming up with new ideas and working on them/figuring out how to pursue them. When most students go home, they shut off their minds and are barely using them, causing them to not be as prepared to use them the next day. If they have to stay after school for student council or yearbook, they'll still be using their brain. Lastly, students will actively learn communication skills. Communicating is so important in your life and will forever help you. You can't be in a club or play on a sports team and never learn how to communicate, because of this they will actively be learning new communication skills.

Finally, these activities can help students be more confident. First off, some students think that they are alone in this world and that they is no one else is like them. If students join clubs that interest them, it'll show them that they are not alone and that there are other people that are similar to them. Even if they aren't doing something they're familiar with, there will be other kids that are also trying it for the first time. Second, clubs and groups teach them how to talk to people. As I have said, you can't be involved in a group or on a team and not communicate with them. If students are basically required to talk to other people during the activities, it'll boost their confidence and help them talk to new people on their own. Last but not least, these activities will show them that they are good at something. It is very common for young kids to think that they are horrible at everything, especially if school and learning isn't their strong suit. These clubs can show them that they do have skills and are good at something.

In conclusion, I think that students should have something to look forward to in school and not want to do anything to be out of going. They shouldn't have to wake up in the morning and dread going to a place they should love. This is why extracurricular activities should absolutely be a requirement. They have so many benefits and there will be many good outcomes. If extracurricular activities become a requirement, students will become more involved in their school and everything around them, they will stay active in multiple ways and constantly be fit, and these activities will help boost up their self confidence.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
03BAAAE93383,"Whenever you get home, do you do your homework straight away, or do you go directly to your phone or another device? If you don't then you are either a very responsible kid, or you have an activity to do after school like sports practice or student council meetings. Only about half of students are involved in extracurricular activities and the other half go home and are instantly glued to their phone. To stop this a principle from Generic_School decides that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with him because it teaches the students responsibility, helps them with college later on, and they won't be on their phones all day.

One reason students should be obligated to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can teach them to be responsible. A recent test study, taken by UCLA university, shows that adults who were involved in an extracurricular as a child are more responsible than adults who were not involved. This evidence goes to show that if we involve our kids in extracurricular activities while they are still in school, it will help them succeed in their later life as an adult.

Another reason students should be involved in an extracurricular activity is because some activities can help with finding a college later on in life. If you chose a sport or music related extracurricular activity then those will really help you in the future when you are looking into colleges you want to apply to. If you are really good at a certain sport by the time of your sophomore year, you probably have a very high chance of making it on your school's team. College scouts will then come to your games, and if they think you are good enough for their school, they will probably offer you either a full-ride scholarship or a part scholarship. Everyone wants to get into a good college so that they can get into a good career and make a living for themselves. A poll taken by ""earth gov"" asked adults which college they went to and if they were involved in an extracurricular activity during their high school years. About 90% of adults said that they got into college due to a extracurricular they were involved in during high school. This means that if you want a good chance at getting into your dream college then you should probably start thinking about joining an extracurricular.

On the other hand, being involved in an extracurricular activity takes a lot of work and time out of your day. Some kids may have more important things to deal with like babysitting siblings or dealing with family issues. They already have enough stress as it is, we don't need to add extra weight onto their shoulders. Equally, being involved in an extracurricular activity can help teens not spend the entire after school time on their phones. The article ""Are Phones Good for Teens"" writes, ""most of all teens have access to a smart phone, and once they are let out of school and get home, the average teen spends 5 to 76 hours on their phone instead of doing their homework or getting involved in extracurricular activities."" Another article titled ""Extracurricular Activities Help Thousands of Kids Each Year Get Into Their Dream College"" states that ""when kids are not worried about what their friends posted on their Instagram story or keeping their streaks on Snapchat they are deeply involved in extracurricular activites like sports, working on their school's yearbook, or being on the student council of their school."" If the universe was filled with more kids like these then the world would have a larger population of successful young adults than it has right now.

In conclusion all students should be obliged to be involved in extracurricular activities becuase it helps them learn how to be responsible in their future life, it can help student get into a good college and be successful in life, and it can keep students off of their phones all day. To save our earth, the first step is saving the future generation.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

While normally an extracurricular activity is optional, now everyone has to participate in one. This is an unreasonable thing to do, what if some students don't like the activities that they provide? Some students already have other things to do after school, so it's just putting more stress on them.

Schools have a limited option of extracurricular activities, so students may not be able to find something they enjoy. Let's say that all the students could choose from sports, the yearbook, or the student council. Most students wouldn't enjoy that as much, so they would feel obligated to choose an activity they don't enjoy. Although some students may enjoy those activities, not all will. If the principal wants to enforce this, they'll have to add more options for extracurricular activities.

A lot of students already have other activities they do after school, that would make students more busy and have less time to have some free time to themselves. Most teachers give out homework for students to do at home. If they are busy with extracurricular activities. Because of this they'll most likely not have time to do their homework or not have time to take a break.

After school, most kids come home tired or exhausted. They want a little time to themselves since they had to do a lot of work at school and now they'll have to do work at home. If too much stress or tension is put on them, there can be tons of negative effects. Such as low performance in schools, when they come to school they'll be tired from all the work they had to do yesterday. This is why schools shouldn't make after school activities mandatory. Putting more work on them is not going to help them, what will help is giving them time to take a break, having some time to themselves may not seem like a lot but it goes a long way.

With all of these reasons, certainly making students do an extracurricular activity seems like a terrible idea. It's not necessary for schools to take time out of their day when they're not at school. Students get tired, schools should understand that. Participating in an extracurricular activity is not going to do them any good, some students already have activities to do. Saying that they have to choose at least one activity shows that the school doesn't expect much of them, but they are already expecting students to take away their free time for some after school activity that won't even be much of a help to them.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A1D2C03AA286,"Why we can do what we want after hours.

By Generic_Name,

The idea of a mandatory after school or extracurricular activity is filled with huge flaws. From angry parents to legal trouble, this is me, ""pouring gasoline onto the fire.""

1. Its a simple idea really. Make kids participate in extracurricular activities against their wills. More money to the school and things that college will look back on and say,

""You were in the yearbook club in 8th grade, congratulations welcome to Harvard!""

In fact collages dont look at most things from middle school, colleges dont really care because middle school dost have college counting courses till about 8th grade. The things they look at are your activities in high school and your grades in high school along with your SATs. This means that depending on the school (middle or high school) this would be for no good reason than to give kids experience and make people pay money for their kids to participate in these extracurricular activities.

2. This will make parents and kids mad. The addition of extracurricular activities means the violation of rights and possible putting people at health risks. Think about it, you miss a doctors appointment because you have to do this or suffer for not attending. You could have people with diabetes not have to correct things to eat after the extracurricular activity running them the risk of high or low blood sugar. Heart and lung conditions also. Its not good.

3. Timing will be off put, if your already part of a sports team and try to balance two of them at once the intersecting times will get you in trouble on both side and will let your team down. Traffic will now be a problem considering students getting back near 5 or 6 and getting out in rush hour traffic. Meaning they get home later and and wont have enough time to work on important work they need for school. Not to mention not everybody can even attend after hour activities, doctors appointments, travel, family matters. This will spiral out of control fast causing parents and students alike to start taking action against the school.

4. A revolt will happen, I'm making this sound dramatic but it will. It will start with a majority of people saying ""this is stupid"" and not attending these extracurricular activities. This will start taking effect with everyone and now a lot of people will start leaving the extra curricular activities. Then you have to face the parents, very angry and annoyed phone calls saying ""I cant pay for this!"" or ""We have no time on our schedule to deal with this!"" Eventually if the mandatory extracurricular activities dont end or become optional. Parents will probably start filling complaints to the school board or Virginia legislators. Did i mention that keeping kids at school after hours against their will is literary kidnapping. An offense of the law. So this will end two ways, cancellation of the mandatory extracurricular actives by the school board or by VA legislation, or parents pulling their kids out of the school successfully lowering the productivity, ranking, and reputation of the school.

So after all of that, do you think its a good idea to make extracurricular activities mandatory? Ill lat you think about it.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
07EA2B30D5B6,"I disagree with the principal's opinion or option because not everyone likes the listed activities or sports, or they maybe might just not do sports at all. It should only be a list of people who are actually willing to participate and follow directions, not just participate because they have to or are being forced to. Sports aren't meant for everyone or you might not just have the ability to do sports, if the students decide to not participate in sports or the other options it shouldn't be a big deal,some may not want to do an extra class. The principal's choice or option really shouldn't be a must. There should be an agreement with students about it and if some agree they should add extra options. not just sports, Work on the year book, Or serve on the Student Council. That is really only three activities and there might be more but not exciting or just not fun to do. That's why it wasn't mentioned and there is a lot of moving in those few options which includes excercising. So therefore I totally disagree with The Principal's opinion or option of making it a Must do. It can affect people's attendance. They could skip that class because Either they hate it, Maybe not their thing or choice, And not just skipping the class. They maybe just won't come to school at all when they have to do the activity they chose. And that's not what the principal is trying to prove or achieve. The Principal wants excercising and moving but students don't. and also aswell complaining. Students may whine a lot to their teacher saying stuff like I don't want to be here or disrespecting The Teacher who gladly decided to help out. So in my opinion I think it's just better to keep it the way it is right now and not add the option of must do sports or the other activities.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
51EE6BE022BC,"What if student want to do and not for extracurricular activity and they just want to do it?

Yes student should take another extracurricular activity because student learn how to make new friends,achieve they goal easy in schools

Doing extracurricular activity in schools because it help build something they don't do in home or outside of the schools. It also mean student can discover something new in the activity with they. It help student to achieve they work quickly. If they have they friends by there side and do something that both like it make the activity fun.

Student can make new friends in activity because they are so many activity and student can make new and have fun with them. Activity mean to build new friendship and know each other that mean they don't know nothing about you have fun and laugh with them. Both can discover something new together.

Achieve they goal in schools because do something that is hard and don't have time for it. When student try something hard it can show great job and have great good grade in schools because do extracurricular activity. Don't have time for it, still try it don't know if you like or dislike it it will help get a great grade.

Have fun in activity because you will make lots friends and discover something new in the activity.

3063BD6D280D,"How would you feel if you had a school that made you work nonstop for the whole day, it would be tiring. Thats why I think students shouldnt have to take classes without a class that They chose, therefor students should take these classes, because doing other activities can relax their brains after lots of studying. For example a student could be really worn out from a test, but his still exited for that class he chose .Thats why students should get extracurricular classes so they can enjoy school.

If a student for example want to do sports and he really liked it and wants to join a team and becomes a professional it would have never ever happened if the school never gave him the chance. Theres many other things that students miss because his or her school never gave him or her a chance,therefor a school should try its best to present its students with many different options, for example ,coding,engineering,music,acting. and many more.

All these things could be activities student have talents for.

So making a student choose a class could influence them to do lots of things and it can make their school day better.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
168890CF840E,"Your sitting home alone with nothing to do wasting away with boredom, if so then you should do some extracurricular activity. I agree because, I think kids having to do extracurricular activities for school help them, and lets them help. These activities give kids things to do, may help them make friends, and gives them a chance to help others.

First, extracurricular activities give young people something to do. This will get them out of their houses. These children have to go and help their team with the extracurricular activity that they chose. It will also make them use their brains. It teaches them to think outside of the box and to make creations from a thought. Lastly, it can also help them manage their time wisely. If they have other activities that give work or are near the same time, this will help them by learning what is more important or what they care more about. Some students might struggle to find time to do these activities, but they can chose what and when their activities should be.

Secondly, these activities will help kids make new and lasting friendships. Make them work with others. Because these are all run by the school you will have to meet new people regardless, so why not try to make a lasting impression to the people you work with. Have them go on group outings. The children may not be friends with anybody yet and are looking for something to do, group activities are prefect, not only do you do fun stuff with your group, but also get to know them a bit better. They will help each other. If you have problems with home work or a problem with some one around school the others in your group can, and will help you with the problems that you may have. Kids may be shy and don't want to talk to others they don't know this will help them break the ice with a few people so they have some friends to hold them up.

Lastly, this gives them a chance to help others. They can help friends. if a friend needs help on understanding their part of the extracurricular activities or home work then you can help them to understand what they are suppose to do. You can help the school. If you are in student council and think of a way to better the school then you have the power to do what you think is right for the school and students. Finally, this give students a chance to help the community. The students could find ways to benefit the place where they live making it cleaner, safer, or in anyway better. If someone is having a hard time think of how good it would feel to help them out.

Extracurricular activities do influence kids to better themselves, their school, and community. One way was giving these students something to do to improve themselves. Another is making new friends making others lives better helping both school and community. Last is helping others in any way needed for home work, a project, or just by listening. Think of how much better it would feel to help others even if you didn't want to join an extracurricular activity.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
3AAAF2D5E736,"Have you ever participated in an activity where you either loved or hated it? Well, believe it or not, I think that all extracurricular activities should be appreciated. Extracurricular activities are activities used to equip you with new skills that you may not have had before, not used to only have fun and learn nothing from it just because your parents forced you to do it. They are there for a reason, and should be taken advantage of. I agree with the decision of the principal for making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity for three reasons: it gives you the opportunity to learn a life lesson, it can improve your academic performance, and gives you a chance to make new friends.

The opportunity given to you to learn a life lesson can be rare. To learn a life lesson means to realize that this world we live in, isn't fair nor perfect. There will be times where you wish certain things had happened to make life better for you, but that just simply can't happen. Participating in an extracurricular activity can create memories and meaningful experiences that you can't experience anywhere else. It can also help with being disciplined, and can give you something to live for. That is why I think that taking part in an extracurricular activity can be life-changing.

The act of participating in an extracurricular activity can even improve your academic performance. Depending on the activity, it can motivate students to do better if a certain activity requires you to have good grades in school. Participation in these activities can relieve stress, and looks good on your resume for college applications. Experiences from the activity can be stored up in your brain to be used as background knowledge in the future. Those reasons tie into the fact that taking part in an extracurricular activity should be mandatory.

A chance to make new friends is always exciting for everyone. Making new friends also means making new relationships with the people you care about. Having people that you care for, rather than having random strangers around you, doesn't give you a sense of loneliness. It brightens you up like the sunrise, when you see the first beam of light. Making new friends especially while participating in an extracurricular activity makes it more fun, and amusing. It gives you an electric shock of joy, making you excited to come back again the next time. That is why I believe that participating in an extracurricular activity would be beneficial.

Many people say that students should have a choice whether or not they would like to participate in an extracurricular activity, but I believe that it should be more of the opposite. The opportunity to learn a life lesson, improve your academic performance, and make new friends are the three reasons why I think that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Therefore, when you meet a student that currently doesn't participate in an extracurricular activity, invite them to join you, or find an activity that you think they would enjoy. This would be a great opportunity for everyone because they would be able to relieve their stress, do something that they love to do, and would enjoy every second of the activity, spending time with the ones they care about the most. Overall, I believe that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because of all the benefits, and the giant footprint that it would leave on this planet.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
F082049D272E,"I would disagree I don't think you should have to participate in extracurricular activity and I'll tell you my reason why I disagree.

First reason It should be your choice if you want or don't want to participate in extracurricular activity. Somebody shouldn't decide how you make your own choice because you should be able to have the choice to do or not to do extracurricular activity.

Second reason why you shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activity is because you could be already busy with something else they shouldn't need anymore work or pressure on them. Also this would mean you stay at school longer time because of extracurricular activity.

Third reason it will be harder to get in to the extracurricular activity that you want because since every student have to choose one it will get full much faster then normal. So that mean if you choose something you do like you'll have a unlikely chance of getting it and then get something you don't like.

Fourth reason you can't find something that you'll want to choose for a extracurricular activity because you could get bored very easily. It would also be hard to choose if you are also very picky because you don't have many choices to choose from.

Fifth and final reason no one can come and get you after your extracurricular activity. A lot of parent have jobs that make them work late and then they don't have time to pick you up and that a problem because extracurricular activity are after school.

So these are reason why I don't think you should have to participate in extracurricular activity.    ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
167AE151377D,"Should your Principal make you do at least one Extracurricular Activity?

When your principal has decided that everyone should do an extracurricular activity, what would you think about that idea? If you want to do an extra activity at school then do things that could make you happy. Maybe try something new and you might be interested, learn more about it. I think that the principal should make kids do extracurricular activities but it should be optional. I will give reasons why the principal should make extracurricular activities optional and not something your forced to do.

Physical and Mental Strength

If you want to do an extracurricular activity then you should do one that you will really like and enjoy. Maybe you want to try something new, you can learn a lot from trying something new and you might even like and enjoy it. Maybe your very distracted about something going on at school or at home, you can try something you like and have fun. Doing a sport for your extracurricular activity can help you get stronger and improve your physical strength. You can hangout with your friends and make new ones, it can improve friendships.

Trying New Things

There are pros and cons to trying new things. What if you don't like your activity or you are struggling to understand? You can ask a friend or an adult to help, you can also try to switch. Some people try new things and they really enjoy it, maybe you tried something new and really enjoyed it. It can be hard to learn something you never new about but it can be fun sometimes.

No Extracurricular Activities!!!

Some people might not like doing extracurricular activities and that's fine. Many people might have things to do at home or places to go to. It can be useless and you probably know how to do many things. What if kids want to focus on their studies more than their activities? What if kids want to grow up being someone who focuses more in math or English but they have to do activities instead? Like what most parents say, ""Focus on your studies.""

What Would You Do?

Are you interested in doing extracurricular activities? What would you like to do for your activity? Would you like your principal make everyone do at least one activity? Try to do an activity that will help you grow. Maybe something that you and your friends will enjoy so you can have fun while socializing. What would you do?",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
A1F3E0A2A43B,"About 57% of schools students participate in extracurricular activities. This means that over half of every school has students that already participates in an activity. I disagree with this decision because some students do not have time after school, don't have the transportation afterwards, or not interested.

With this added, where will they find the time for their home life?

First, I disagree because some students have a job after school. Some students have to work that job to help support, so having this added would just add to their stressful life. Second, some students have to help their families with things such as chores, make dinner, etc. If they have to stay at school longer, some of those important things wouldn't get done. Third, as we get older we get more homework and harder tests, so it's up to us to keep up with it. After school is the time where the students get to study or do their homework, so when would they do it if they have to stay after school everyday?

Not every student has transportation afterwards, so what do students do when no one can pick them up? First, parents are busy people and have jobs too. Some parents just can't leave work to get their child. Second, if they don't have a ride, they will have to wait with a teacher until someone can pick them up. Thats not fair to the teacher, but to the student too. Third, students would have to bug other busy parents to ask for a ride home. Their friends parents can't always take them home, so on those days how do they get home?

Some students just aren't interested, so why make them do something they don't want to do? First, if they are not interested, they most likely wont be paying attention. If the students not even paying attention, whats the point of even having them there? Second, they would be distracting the people that want to be there. If a student isn't into what they're doing, they are most likely gonna move a lot, make noises, or talk to the people around them. Third, they most likely wont put any effort in what they are doing. No one wants to be around the kid that doesn't do their work, so whats the point in them coming if the aren't going to put in the effort?

FB14FF43E876,"Would you agree or disagree with everyone must have an extracurricular activity, I agree and this is why.

I agree with the principal saying everyone must have an extracurricular activity because, it could help lots of people get out of the house a lot more, if they just to have fun and do something, or it could help people talk to and get to know other people.

The reason I say it could help people get out the house more. They may be locked in their house and can't do anything but school. Also they might be doing nothing just sitting in their house.

Even if they just want to have fun and do something. They can just go to school and do a activity. So then you can have fun with your frenids and do what u love.

It would be a good help for some people. They may have insety. They could have a mental problem and needs to talk to someone. They could just sit down and talk to people and get to know other people.

So after reading why I agree. would you or would you not agree with the principal. There are lots of reasons someone would agree those are mine. Some were important reasons and some were not so important.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
12A49BF3B556,""" your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity"". How would you feel if your principle has made this decision?, and would you agree with this or disagree?. I feel as though, the principle has made the right desicion. People might not agree with this but, all I can do is speak for myself.

Why, do i agree with such a thing?. I agree with this desicion because, this desicion could do everyone some good. Doing some type of sport or even working on the school news paper could be fun. It would be expecially good for parents. Why? you might ask because, the students won't come home as early, and the parents will have time to run erin's and get some stuff done before their children get home. The parents will also be able to just have more time to their selves.

Also, this could be helpful to the children mentally and physically. Three out of four children and teens spend more than seven hours on their phone or watching television. These devises put out blue light into the the eye which is bad because, this can cause straining in the eye or even total blindness. when you are on your phone most of the time you have acess to the internet which means you can get on social media websites. When on websites like snapchat and instagram teens tend to compare their selves to others, and if they aren't up to par to look like ""pretty"" people they can get sad and form some type of depression.

Overall, students should build more life skills and social skills, and adding extracurricular activity's to the students day can help with that. building life skills at a younger age can be great so, when you get out into the world you'll atleast know some key factors to living. Building social skills is great too. Lets say you get a job in marketing, you need to be social, have great speech, and be outgoing. In fact, you need social skills for any job. The principle making the desicion to add an extracurricular activity's to students day at school was and great idea.

In conclusion, adding an extracurricular activity to all of the student body would be an great idea because, it could be benifial to students, parents. and teachers. Building social skills. Life skills, and just being productive has all to do with adding an extracurricular activity to a students day. I think i have stated what my opinion is and what i agree and disagree with. What my opinion is, is that the principle making that desicion is wise and thoughtful.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
9EABE5CEBE94,"Generic_Name sighed while he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, and was pretty bummed that he realized he didn't join any clubs or sports during his time at school. Even though his friends recommended that he should, he didn't really want to do it. All of his friends that joined activities made cool, new friends in the clubs they were in, and became more active when they participated in sports. He was upset that he didn't do any of those things in middle school, but decided that he would give it a chance when he went to high school. When he got home, Generic_Name thought about the kinds of clubs he wanted to join, and different sports he wanted to participate in, and was looking forward to it.

Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity during school because it can help you make new friends, help you become more fit/ stay active depending on the activity, and can improve your skills on specific things. If you join any sports or clubs, you are definitely going to meet new people to make your friends, which is a great thing because it gives you people to talk to and get along with so you won't be by yourself in any activities you would do after school. However, some people don't like joining clubs because they could be antisocial or can be nervous and have trouble meeting new people, but it's okay, it takes time to get used to people you dont know, so joining clubs and making new friends can help you be more social and find it easier to get along with others. Joining sports/ physical clubs can help you stay in shape and stay healthy because most sports will most likely have you break a sweat, and a lot of sports include running and jumping, and require some strength. Volleyball, wrestling, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, etc, keep you active and healthy because your exercising by doing sports which is good for your body, but you have to keep in mind not to overwork yourself because it can become tiring and maybe a little dangerous if you work for too long without taking any breaks. Sports can definitely become rough and you can really get hurt if your not careful, so it's important to get enough sleep, eat right, and stay hydrated before playing so you don't risk getting injured.

Being in most clubs can help to improve skills on different things such as art, cooking or baking, acting, writing, sewing, and things like that. Some things that are provided in different clubs can really come in handy at some point in your future. Learning new things or improving your skills can impress your friends and family, and can sometimes earn you money. For example, if you improve in art or sewing, you would be able to sell it for a bit of money depending on how skilled you are, maybe $20-$30, or if you're good at cooking/ baking, you could sell it at a bake sale or maybe just give it to your friends or family to enjoy as a treat. Learning new things and improving skills can be fun, but sometimes it can take time and effort to put into learning new things and improving, so you have to be willing to take time into that and do your best because it's worth it in the end.

Generic_Name smiled as he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, as he sat down in his seat with the friends he made during the year through after school activities, they remembered and talked about all the cool sports and clubs they did during their time throughout middle school. They remembered the clubs they joined such as facs club and art club, and how their skills on baking and drawing improved, they also talked about the sports like soccer and basketball they all participated in together, and Generic_Name can definitely say that he's gotten healthier since he joined.

I agree with Making kids participate in an extracurricular activity because it would fix this problem by making kids participate. One reason why Being forced to participate in an extra curricular activity could benefit these kids is because it could make them more have more hobbies and goals. The next reason why making them participate in extracurricular activities would be good for them is because they can find new activities that they enjoy and become successful of them. Another reason why forcing them to participate would be good is because It could allow them to develop better social skills and become a better person.

One reason why forcing them to do activities would benefit them is how they could develop new hobbies and goals. For example, when I started swimming my parents forced me to go to practice even when I did not want to. Now I am a competitive swimmer and enjoy going to practice because I have goals that I want to accomplish. This example shows how making someone participate in something can sometimes benefit them by giving them new hobbies and goals. Another example is when my parents signed me up for the river hawk running program at my school and I did not enjoy running. But now I have made running one of my hobbies and I will try out for my high schools cross country team. This example shows how I was being forced Into running and started out not liking it but now I do. These examples show how being forced into doing something can benefit you by giving you goals and a chance to pursue something.

The next reason why I think making students participate in an extracurricular activity could benefit them is because they can find new activities that they enjoy and then become successful in them. An example is how my parents forced me to swim and now I will be on TV swimming in Florida at the national level for my age group. This example shows how I was successful and because I was forced to be a swimmer I made it on TV. Another example is how my mom forces me to go to school and I have become a successful student and have been getting all A grades. Another example of how making students participate in an extracurricular activity could make them more successful Is how my brother became a successful piano player. My parents made him start taking Piano lessons and now he has become great at Piano and may try to become are school Piano player. This example shows how my brother became successful by my parents making him start piano. All of these examples show how It would be good for the principle to make the students participate in an activity because it would make them a more successful person.

Another reason why making students participate in an extracurricular activity could benefit them Is how they could develop better social skills and become a better person. An example of this is when I was in fourth grade and I did not like to talk to people. But when my parents signed me up for a activity after school that would help go around helping people and do food drives I became involved with the program and started to talk to people finding ways to help others. This example shows how I developed better social skills and I became a better person by helping others. Another example of how extracurricular activities help develop my social skills is when I joined my first Triathlon team I had work hard to keep up with my team and cheer for other teammates. This example shows how I was using social skills to cheer for my teammates and why extracurricular activities could benefit students.

I agree with Making students do extracurricular activities. One reason why I think making kids do extracurricular activities would be a good Idea Is because they can develop new hobbies and make goals for themselves to achieve. Another reason why I think they should be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity is because they could find new activities that they enjoy and become successful in them.

A1E3FA6EC622,"I think that kids shouldnt have to do more than one extrasurricular activity. First it could interfear with there scedule, second it could get in the way of school and lastly it could induce stress.

First the childs scedule. Some children are busyer than other so there could be a posibility that that he or she well not have enough time for that activiy. Next the activity could be to early for the child and they might have to wake up earlier than anticipated and not feeling as energized for the day ahead. Then the activity could start or end late which would cause the child to lose precious hours of sleep.

Second it could cause the children to start academicaly failing due to say not haveing enough time to study for a quiz or haveing enough time to do homework. This could also have a major impact on the students gardes causeing the to drop dramaticly. Time that cuts into school also cuts into time to study. Studying time is very crushial because it helps the child to remember the material for there quizes and tests. Finally it could take up sleep time which could posibly make that child tired and sluggish in school witch would cause the student not to do as well in shcool as if he or she were well rested and had an desent amount of sleep that night.

Third is that some kids dont do extracurricular activites is that it causes stress. The activites could cause the child to lost sleep and that could leave the child tired and stressed for the rest of there school day.

3923909DE518,"Have you ever done something you didn't want to do because your parents made you do it? This makes you annoyed at your parents because they just ignored what you wanted to do. It is bad enough that your parents make you do the activity, but what if your principal made you do it. This is why I disagree with our principal making us do extracurricular activities. It is our life, most kids already do extracurricular activity, and some kids don't have time.

It is our life not the principals. If we want to do activities outside of school it should be our families chose not the principals. Principals job is to be in charge when school is in session, so extracurricular activities happen after school not during school hours. Life is supposed to be enjoyed not suppressed by the principal. We are 8th graders we have a lot of freedom while in school, so why would the school be able to take our freedom away when we aren't in school. We should get to decide our own path not the principal.

Most kids already do extracurricular activities. They help us make new friends, us can get better, and you could be really good and get scholarships. Some kids can't afford extracurricular activities as their is usually a joining fee or yearly fee to be in the club. Kids do extracurricular activities because they look good on college resume, but some kids don't want to go to college. They might not want to take on so much debt or they want a job that doesn't require a degree. Extracurricular activities are good for some, but not all.

Kids don't always have time. Some kids are put in tough situations whether it is money, gang violence drugs, mom and dad divorce, or foster care. They need their families help to fight through these tough times. If they are staying after school until five and have to ride the bus home it probably won't be until six until they get home. Then an hour of homework and eating dinner and it is already seven and they have had no family time yet. Their parents might also work multiple jobs to make just enough money to scrape by, so their parents might not even be home. If the kids got home at normal time they could help clean their own house or make some extra cash for the family. Everybody has tough times, but if they are spent with people who care about them they can go by faster.

I disagree with the principal making us do extracurricular activities. I don't think forcing people to do them is the answer to every bodies problems. Extracurricular activities are helpful for some people but it depends on the situation for what the best way to solve the issue is whether it means seeing a therapist or spending more time with your family. It should be up to the family what is done not our principal.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
1BDD5C33D152,"I don't belive it is manditory for all students to do an extracurricular activity. I belive it should be the students choice on if is necessary to participate in an activity. The activities you are asking the student to participate in might not be something to enjoy or somrthing they want to do. Also some students may not have the time to do the activity at hand.

Also if the activity is something physical , the student might have a condition that causes them not to be able to do the activity.

Time is every thing it is something we depend on all the time in our daily lives. Students need time to do the things they have planned as well. Others may have other activites outside of the school activities requested. Some students may want to study rather than do an activity that they know they might not have time for. Some students may have bad grades and want to bring them up and needs that time to do his or her work to bring their grade up. If the time of the activity doesn't fit within the time on which the student is free how will they be able to do the activity?

The second reason why i don't belive it is important to participate in an activity is because, the student might not any of the activities listed that they would be interested in. Student might want to do this activity simply because of the way the student thinks of the activity. A lot of people are not interseted in doing another acivity because of the are already in or just don't want to do. This also raps around the fact that the student may not have the time to do so and that he or she has enough work or extra things to do regarding themselves. It's the students opinion on what they want to do.

I belive the students should decide on whether or not it's a good choice to have this in place. If the students vote and make a decision they can make a reasonable conclusion that helps every student affected by it. After hearing what the students recomend to the principal, then the principal might not carry on with his decison if it's helpfull or not. Students need their opinions to be heard as well.!

The main thing is the students. How do they feel about what the principal wants to put in place. In my opinion it shouldn't be a requirment to participate in an extracurricular activity. The students are the ones effected not the pricipal ! It should be up to the student not the principal.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
387C6CD3FD66,"Did you ever work on yearbook, play a sport, or serve on student council? These are all extracurriculars that could be provided at your school. Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps with college prep, helps with stress, and doesn't take much time.

Working on a extracurricular can helps you prepare for college. When you send in your college application they not only look a grades but what you bring to the table. If you play football they might want you for there football team or if you play in band they might want you for there school band. Colleges also give out scholarships for certain activities. If you were good enough at your extracurricular you may even qualify for financial help to pay for college. It shows that you can stick with something and that you are a hard worker and you can keep working even when something is new and difficult. Colleges look at these kinds of things its important to be prepared and accomplished.

Taking a break in the middle of the day and going to a fun class that you choose can really help with stress. It lets you take a break between your academic classes. You some times end up sitting for hours doing math,science, and reading you can become tired and stop focusing. Taking a hour to thirty minutes to stretch, run around, and talk is good for you it can help with your drowsiness and boredom. Taking a break and doing something you love and enjoy could only benefit you. Sports or things like art also improve motor skills and can have a calming affect they can also increase melitonin production in your brain which helps with anxiety and depression. Not only does this mean that it can help with any conditions you may have but also allows personal improvement to take place. Taking time for yourself and picking a class you will enjoy can help you reduce stress.

Some people may say that its a wast of time and you could be doing something academic with that time and that other activities would be more appropriate for the school day. however, there are academical purposes for these activities you could learn a language or take a extra class to get help with math. It is all up to what you want to do with that extra class. Spending six hours of your day sitting and doing work only to get a break to eat is not good for you. If changing that means you waste a half a hour to just run around or talk then so be it.

Some my look at these classes and say they are a waste of time and a distraction from the important classes but the also help in the long run.

Students need to take a break and join a class they enjoy it will help them with college prep, although them to take a break, and is a good use of there time. There are many benifits to allowing your self time to work on personal goals and make time for yourself

It doesnt need to be a large amount of time or the most acidemic class it just needs to be a class that you enjoy. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Parents and other people think it is good to have extracurricular activity for kids. People say that it helps kids interact with other kids. People also say that it takes time away from them going on their phone. I also agree that every kid should have to take one. You are not taking five or six it is just one. I think this would be a great thing to do. It would help kids find, or improve there hobbies. A hobby is some thing you like to do. Hobbies are cool and there are a lot of your hobbies at school in the from of after school activity. They even can fit the your week. You can even find friends that like the same thing you do. There are clubs that are just certain grades.

Clubs are on every day of the week. Like how on Mondays kids go to running club, or on Thursday kids go to drama club. Kids do all sorts of cool clubs. Clubs are made to be on all sort of days Monday, Tuesday, Wensday, Thursday, and Friday. There are a bunch of clubs here are some. You have running club, drama, lacrosse, chess, girl scouts, yearbook, vex, knitting, battle of the books. You see that is just some of them. Maybe you should try one?

There other good thing about having extracurricular activity. Maybe you will meet someone that likes what you like, and you guys or girls will be friends. You could also have a better relationship with the teacher who teaches the club. I could see you thinking but if there are little kids, and they can be a little annoying. If you ask but what if the older kids run me over. Then there is a place for you because there are clubs that are just older or younger kids.

I think it would be great to have every person to do one extracurricular activity. There are many factors that they are good. Like they can fit your week, there are a lot of club to pick from, meet new friends,and last but not least there are age clubs too.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

Extracurricular activities should be required in schools because they help students release stress, help thinking in a new way, and makes school enthralling to those who have not been blessed with natural intelligence. Extracurricular activities can improve many students lifestyles.

A long day of tiring work builds up unnecessary stress. Students are packed with homework in subjects they may not enjoy. To end their day with an activity they enjoy can make a horrific day into an enthralling experience; for example, majority of people like spending time with others who they have things in common with. Growing up, it was hard for me to socialize, it felt as if everyone else was functioning faster than Ic was. After a day that felt as if the human population was filled with nothing but sorrow, I finally got to go home and feel the crystal clear water cool my body down, as my team practiced steadily for our swim competition. To have a kid feel relaxed and at peace will improve what they think as they wake up on Monday mornings.

In the school I have attended for junior high, I am required to take classes that focus on music. In the sixth grade, I chose orchestra because it was an amusing experience to see how one movement in my wrist could cause a pleasant noise to be heard throughout the room. In my science class, we had moved on to the sound unit and i excelled while many other students did not. When my science teacher used words such as octaves, pitch, and harmony it wasn't difficult to understand. The extracurricular activities I have taken have opened my mind into a more creative way of thinking. They taught me that there is more meaning on a paper than what is written in ink.

One of the many symptoms of depression is memory loss. Since my mother had suffered from the illness, it was genetically passed down to me. Even as a child it was clear to me that school was mainly about memorization. When teachers talked about how we had learned topics in prior years my brain scattered through the many memories in my head but was unable to remember anything. Extracurricular activities aren't about your ability to memorize, but your motivation to excel. That's why it will help students who are more academically challenged would more likely enjoy these activities.

Activities a student enjoys can introduce them to experiences they didn't know were possible. Extracurricular activities help students release stress from the hardships of their day, show them a way to think that they haven't seen before, and is beneficial for those who believe they are not intelligent. I believe that they would be helpful to students and help them excel in the future and should be required in schools.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
E5B77EA58C0B,"I think that having to do a after school activity is a great idea. Some might think that they shouldn't but it helps. because it helps in the real world, it helps you be in better shape and it's fun. Those are some reasons, now lets get into deeper detail.

Doing after school activities help in the future, especially if your trying to get a job. They help you with skills you will need to get a job. Like playing on a sports team and the fight to the #1 seed. Helps you because if your trying to get a promotion then you know how it feels to work hard for something that you want. there are also things that can help you get a job like helping take pictures for a yearbook. You could be a photographer.

Doing after school activities also keep you in better shape by keeping you up after school instead of going home and doing nothing. Sports also keep you in good shape by exercises, running and conditioning drills. Also for sports you sometimes have to be fit and well put together so if your not your not making the team.

They are also fun, because for yearbook on school spirit days you get to be out of class taking pictures for people with school spirit. Also wearing your football jersey on a school day makes you feel like your in a high school football movie. It also feels so good to get on the field and make a play. One of the most fun things in sports if not the most fun thing is a bus ride back after a win.

Those are some reasons why I support his statement on everyone should do after school activities. Because they will help in the future, they help you get in shape and they are fun. those are my reasons hope you like it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
D287C855A18A,"Would you like your parents being disapointed in you beacause you didn't do well in your grades? They say your always focusing on school sports, being, council, etc. They think you don't focus on your school work. That might not be the reason, you could be struggling in your studies because of the school activity your told to do. i know my parents would be disapointed in me for having bad grades. I definetly don't support the principles decision of making it a requirement for students to participate in an activity.

Some parents make their kids run errands, doing so may lead them to not be able to participate. They might have younger siblings they have to watch over which makes it hard as well. Students of extra assistance might not be able to do the activities. As the year will go by, studies will get more advanced. Students might get stressed, with the activity on their hands they might get more stressed. I know how it feels to be stressed and overwhelmed as a student, things are harder to get done with being pressured. People have different things going on in their lives, it might be hard for them to go to school if there family are not in their llife as much. They could live far away from the school and have no tranportation for school or attending their own game practices.

I think they should require only what is mandatory to pass the current grade students are in. Sport, running for student council, or participating in a school related event should be optional. Some people don't like participating in sports and all these other things, it just might not be their thing. Parents might wanna put their kids in tutoring after school because of their grades, but unfortunatly they can't because they got game practice or school duties. All of these problems caused by the principles decision will lead to students transferring to another school. It might also put a bad name on the school.

The staff and teachers at the school might be paid a smaller amount of money than their regular pay. If there are no students at the school, the teachers might quit their jobs. The school might shut down, we can't let this happen. If we all work together we can make a big change! We can talk the principle out of this, make students happy, and parents proud again! The parents and students lives wont be so stressful anymore.

Finally, that is why i reject having to participate in an school activity. I want to study stress free and have my life at ease. Students should participate in school activities only if they want to. They shouldn't be forced to if it's not required.

159D4CDA17B0,"According to Dr. Maxwell Olchena, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains, participating in marching band can do one of two things depending on your personality, just wait until you see what his studies have proven! I think it's very important to do an extra curricular activity, but I do not believe it should be required, as we just do not have enough options for extra circulars to fit every student's desires. Some extra circulars, such as marching band, are not for the light of heart and truly are scary at points(especially drum line but we'll get into that later.) This is why students should do extra circulars, but it should not be a requirement.

Dr. Maxwell Olchena is a psychologist who has been studying the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains for almost 20 years, here's what his studies have shown: there are two things marching band can do to the brain of an adolescent, and however they are affected depends on their personality and nothing to do with IQ(Intelligence quota). Those with higher IQs tend to perform better in marching band, although marching band does not require you perform well(as hard work brings good performance.) The two things that can happen to the brain of an adolescent when they join marching band are, increased mood and productiveness, or decreased mood and productiveness, thats right. Marching band can do two polar opposite things to the adolescent brain. Dr. Olchena's studies have shown that when someone considered an extrovert joins marching band, their mood will decrease and they will become burnt out, this is because they aren't used to the amount of work put into their social life. Marching band is less a sport and more of a social activity, unless you are willing to accept it as your only family, you will not be happy and become very burnt out. Here's where Olchena's studies get crazy, introverts are more likely to have increased moods and increased productiveness when joining marching band. Olchena's studies have also shown that when and introvert joins marching band, they become more social, and those around them report and increase in socializing. Now here's where this relates to every extra curricular, Olchena had his friend, and fellow psychologist, Dr. Alan Russell study this in his area of study, debate team, and the exact opposite is true for this extra curricular. Introverts tend to lose productiveness and have a decrease in happiness, whereas extroverts tend to have increased productiveness and mood.

Drum line, however, is where the studies get interesting. Dr. Brock Hayman, an expert in the effects of drum line on the adolescent brain, has discovered a new area of the brain that awakens the second you join drum line. This area is called the Drumbolow Cortex. When activated, this area of the brain never turns off. The Drumbolow Cortex does some weird things to the brain once activated, it can cause the person to do crazy things, such as picking up gum on the ground of the parking lot at band camp(This has actually happened before.) Other signs that this area has been activated are: inability to stop drumming, addiction to buying drumsticks, need to move up rankings in drumlins, and recruiting more people for the drum line. studies show that 90% of people do not even have this area in their brain, and fewer than 5% of the population has it activated.

These are all good reasons why you should join an extracurricular(*cough cough drum line cough cough*,) so why shouldn't it be a requirement? Dr. Brett Staudt, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on people's actions around family members, has the answer to your question. ""Those who chose to join marching band will become a disturbance to their family, they will become obsessed with showing their family shows by Drum Corps International, such as the Cavaliers 2011 show in which the drums are upside down. Most of the population does not care whatsoever about how amazingly cool it is to drum upside down, but any person who chooses to join marching band, even if they don't do drum line, will become obsessed with the fact that people have enough skill to play the tenors upside down."" This quote says two things, you should watch the Cavaliers 2011 show, and also that marching band has negative effects on the life of family members of the person who chooses this curse/blessing of an activity, not to mention, you'll never see that person again because they'll always be at practice or hanging out with their marching band friends.

Although I do believe it is a good idea to do an extra curricular, Dr. Nathan Strain has done countless studies on forcing adolescents to partake in things, and it causes them to be less interested in what they're doing. I would rather not have people in marching band who are there only because they've been forced to be there, as they will not work as hard because all they care about is the fact that they have to do it. When students have free will and the ability to make their own decision, they will choose what they feel is best for them self and we should let them do whatever they believe is best for their situation in life at the moment. You never know what else a student has to do at home just to have enough money for food, or to pay for other expenses.

What I take away from this evidence is that we should not force students to participate in extra curricular, but rather encourage them to do so. Personally, joining drum line was the best choice(I'm kidding it was a mistake but I'm glad I made it) I've ever made and I will continue doing drum line for the rest of my high school and college career, although had I been forced, I'm not sure if I'd be as happy to be in it. I genuinely think forcing students to do anything will cause burnout and decrease happiness. I truly think students should make their own decision on if an extra curricular fits in their life or not.                ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Whether it's playing sports, participating in student council, school plays, or just painting in art club, all teens and students need that extra confidence, and adrenaline boost that extracurricular activities provide. Principle of Generic_School, Generic_Name, is proposing a new, controversial school rule that states, ""All students at BRMS

must participate in at least one extracurricular activity throughout the year."" Should his rule be enforced or shot down? If you were to compare the pros and cons, the answer is yes! Not only will this rule be beneficial to all of the students physical and mental health, but forcing kids to branch out and do extracurricular activities will bring them out of their shell and mold them into a better person.

The first reason why . Generic_Name's rule should be enforced is pretty clear. By forcing students to participate in activities that they may not have signed up for on their own, they are forced out of their shell and meet new people who share similar passions. In a pole taken at Southern Utah Middle School, the students were asked approximately how many friends they had and generally how they met. The study discovered that most students who were involved in clubs, student council, sports, and etc. answered with higher numbers of friends, many of which they made through their out of school activities. This shows that you don't only just learn a trade catered to your interests, but you also meet lots of new people who share those interests and become your closest relative friends. You could even meet your soul mate! At Harvard University, the students studied married couples and found that over 70% of their top ten passions and interests were shared, that's 7 out of 10! Forming bonds with new people can help with trust and relationship issues and can all be done through simply being forced to branch out and participate in an extracurricular activity at your school.

Another meaningful reason for the students to be forced to enjoy extracurricular activities is because of their mental and physical health. World renown author of several New York Times awarded self-help books, doctor, and psychiatrist, Leonard Steigerwald explains, ""Getting involved in clubs, sports, and other extracurricular activities can not only boost your physical health, but mental too."" Steigerwald is stating the obvious, when students participate in sports, or even a poem writing club, they are staying physically, and mentally active. Being around other people can also help keep you mentally healthy. A recent news story even further investigates this topic, New York resident, Flynn Engstrom, was visiting a relative in Colorado when he got lost on a hike. He was missing for a month and six days and when the police found him, he was in a desperate state. He was so happy to see people that he began to cry uncontrollably. He remembered, ""I was longing to see humans again. I barely had food, or clean water and in my weak mental state, I began to imagine things,"" he shuddered, ""Horrible things that I had convinced myself were real. Seeing those officers, [I] felt my sanity pouring back into my mind."" Although this story is quite an extreme example. If students are just sitting at home all day after school on their phones, their confidence and motivation to do anything will begin to dwindle.

Having a clear head space has been proven to help with academics, and participating in extracurricular activities has proven to help clear your mind. In 2017 students who are active in their community and school were proven to have better SOL, SAT, and just overall grades. GPAs in Colleges have been harder to meet as far as the 110% of all the valedictorians from high schools around the globe. Getting involved in out of or in school activities can look good on job applications, college applications, and can just generally give you motive when you are having a hard time in life. Professor at the University of Utah in Northern Canada, Jillian Hooper explains, ""Everyday I see students struggle with their grades, and everyday the only ones who can bounce back are those who take a break, and spend time volunteering, practicing a sport, or any other extracurricular activity, it's vital for these college students."" She wants people to understand that activities can be beneficial.

Although it's pretty clear that Generic_Name's rule should be passed, it was mentioned earlier to be controversial. This is because several parents and students at Generic_School say that this rule is infringing on their right to pursue happiness. The Constitution clearly states, when listing the rights of all U.S. citizens, ""The pursuit of happiness"" however there are certain exceptions to this law. In schools, students are required to take SOLs and other tests. Do SOLs make students happy? No. Unfortunately though, it is required in schools. Requiring extracurricular activities is quite on the contrary. Instead of going home and ""pursuing happiness"" on their phones, the teens would be able to occasionally stay after school with friends and do something that they care about. The Physical Education Council in Western Loudoun County in Virginia conducted a study with some interesting results. The tracked the brains levels of happiness through the process of cells creating a natural sort of nicotine. When this chemical is released in the brain, it causes the feeling that humans identify as, ""being happy"". The study proved that the chemical was released more often in those who were social and around other people rather then loners, who study, work, and text by themselves. This means that when students participate in activities with others, they are actually happier and mentally healthier.

In the end, the rule should be passed and all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. It will not only be beneficial for their mental health, happiness, and social life, but also for academics and physical activity. ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
E89C454FDDCB,"What do you think about extracurricular activities? I believe that with amazing extracurricular activities can inspire a student to have a new hobby, or learn more about them self. On the other hand, a bad one can make a student want to quit liking the activity and do something else. My principal decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with making students participate in an extracurricular activity because of time, money, and a negative impact on everyone.

The first reason is time. Some students might not have enough time to do an extracurricular activity, which could cause the student to have stress. The teacher might lose passion for what they are teaching because of more students, who are being forced to take an extracurricular activity against their will, coming to their after school activity. If the teacher didn't get an influx of students who were forced to take his class, then the they would not have been worn out as fast, or even at all. This will, over time, slowly wear down the teacher, making the class less enjoyable for everyone. Overall, time will be a large problem with forcing students to do extracurricular activities.

The second reason is money. With more students participating, more supplies need to be bought. There might not be enough money to pay for all of the things students do in an after school activity. The students might not be able to go on trips because they cost to much. People would also be very unhappy if they have to pay for extracurricular activities that their kid was forced into. In the end, there might not be enough money to pay for all of the extracurricular activities.

The final reason is the negative impact it can have on everyone. The teachers will be very stressed because they have many students who don't care about that activity. The students will also have plenty of tension because they now have to stay at school longer, and manage another activity every day. If the students are stressed, the effect is that their grades will drop. In all, it can cause everyone to have more unneeded tension.

In conclusion, I don't think making students participate in an extracurricular activity is a great idea. It could help students become more social, but it can cause more problems than it solves. It wouldn't be good if the students or teachers were unhappy because of the principal making students participate in after school activities. I believe extracurricular activities are used to show students new activities and have fun.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
898FBF6ECEEE,"Extracurricular Activities Shouldn't Be Forced

Have you ever been forced to do something you didnt want to do? Did you do the task happily? Most people would say it was not an enjoyable experience. When talking about the topic of extracurricular activities in schools, it is definitely something that shouldn't be mandatory. These things shouldn't be forced because it will result in unhappy and resentful students. Also, students should be able to choose their hobbies, and it is frankly none of the school's business.

If we force students to participate in a list of activities that may not cater to their interests, it is only going to make unhappy students who don't actually put any effort into the thing they are being forced to do. Again, try and think back to a time when you were made to do something you didnt want to do. Something that took time away from things you actually wanted, or even needed to do. You probably didn't do that thing with a whole lot of thought and effort, or at least you didn't do it in a good mood. What's the point of forcing kids to do activities, if they are just going to do it sloppily, with zero effort. No matter how many options a school provides, there will always be kids who don't like any of them.

Even though they may not like any of the options at school, whose to say they don't enjoy something outside of school. For example, what if a student is really passionate about their art? And between their chores and school work, they only get work on it about an hour of their day. Now, because they are forced to play a sport or join a club, they have absolutely no time to work on what brings them joy. This defeats the whole purpose of an extracurricular activity.

Even if everyone was perfectly happy with the activity they have to do, why is it any of the schools business what people do with their free time? A school's job is to give students a safe place to learn, and to provide optional extracurricular activities. It's not a schools job to control so much of a students life, that it's even taking up time outside of school. Schools have no idea what goes on in a student's life, and it is unfair for them to assume everyone just has the time and want to do an additional thing outside of school. If a student wants to participate in something, they will. There is no need to force people to do things they dont want to do.

As you can see, the idea of making an extracurricular activity mandatory has many downsides. So many that it is obviously it is not a good idea. Making people do things they don't want to do has never turned out good. Students need the freedom to make their own choices, and the school should have nothing to do with that. No matter how many benefits, extracurricular activities should never be mandatory. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
03656D51096B,"Did you know 68% of the students spend an estimated 4 hours on their phone every single day? Have your parent force you to get involve in a activity at school that you don't like? Does your parent ever said, ""You play on your phone 24/7!"" Students should get involve in at least one extracurricular activity at school because students can makes new friends, they get to experience new things that they never done before, and help students express them self to others. Students can choose up to 25 different activities to do after school like sports, art, clean the school, and a lots more different activities. This help students get involve with their school.

When students is participating the extracurricular activities, they can make new friends. When making new friends, they are introducing them self to other students. This can improves their communication and social skills with other, good communication can also help students when they are in school or in the outside world. Additionally, they also get to a better understanding of the other students personality. For example, a student can shared their past experience with another student, discuss what they have in common, their goals, and about their friends and family.

The students get to experience new thing that they never done before. They get to find out what they enjoy, and get to know a little bit of them self. Students can express them self through activities like art, sports, and music etc. Students get to learn new skills throughout the variety of activities, and later students can shared their skills that they have learned to other students or family member. Students also get to learn about different career, subject, languages, and etc. Later, it can help them in life when they are adult.

It can help students get involve with activities. Back when there is no electronic, every kid play outside, and not a single kid hated going outside. Children were energetic, they love outdoor activities and playing with friends. Today generation is different, 10 years old boy playing video games all day, and children spending 4 hours everyday playing on their phone. If we have extracurricular activities at school, then more students would get involve in activities. Parent can also get involve by supporting their children.

In conclusion, there are many benefit when it comes to getting students involve in an extracurricular activities. Students can make new friends, they get to experience new thing, and get to express them self through the activities. Some may say if every students have to get involve in an extracurricular activities. Then, it just going to limit the time that the students get to spend with their family. However, is it going to change anything if parent don't get their children involve in activities? The students is just going to keep playing their phone 4 hours every single day. If parent don't wan't their kid to be 24/7 on their phone. Then, get them involve in an activities at school. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
BD33192DA18E,"It's just another ordinary day in school an so tired and stressed. But luckily you are saved by playing you favorite sport, or you like going round the school taking pictures for a yearbook, you could even be reading your favorite book with your friends in a book club. I believe that students should be allowed to do at least one extracurricular activity of there choice. Because it relieves stress and make students look forward to school, can also be good for the school, and help student figure out what they want to do after they are done with school.

I think that these school activities are good because the student can use these activities as a way to relieve stress by reading. These groups can also include counseling if the student has any problems outside or inside of school. lastly students can use these activities to learn about what they and other student want to learn, for example if the student wanted to learn photography he/she would be allowed to take pictures of flowers or animals. This is why I believe that students can relieve stress from school or from family.

Another that we should allow these activities is that they not only benefit the students but can also benefit the school.

this is because the student can make a club that every week they pick a random teacher and show her/him appreciation for helping us learn. Another thing a students can do is create posters for the school sports team. And they could help put together a school yearbook. This is how these activities will also help the school out.

lastly I think that this could be very helpful for the student and allow them to explore what they want to do. We can do this buy creating activities that can show the students hands on experience of the jobs they can do in the future. for example we could show the how to do there taxes or how to sign up for a credit card. I do personally believe this is a very important thing that we could show the students so they learn early on how to deal with life.

This is why I agree that student should take a extracurricular activities of there choice because it helps with many things. Such as relieving stress and making students happy. Can also help out the teachers and the school. And lastly let kids be aware of what they are going to face in the future and how to deal with it.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
B022347FCF4D,"There are a lot of students that like to stay after school for extracurricular activities . Other students go home and don't even stay after school at all. I strongly disagree that students should not participate in a extracurricular activity if they don't want to. Some students have responsibilities at home for example. Taking care of a younger sibling, cleaning the house, helping their parents out, etc... but on the other hand if students are going home to play video games,not interacting with other people in the outside world then they should,because they can't be inside all day they need some fresh air and interact with other human beings.

But heres the thing students already have school for about 7-8 hours half of the time either listening to the teacher or taking a test so obviously they leave school tried and exhausted.

Many students don't even like coming to school and still show up I think if the principal forced students to join a extracurricular activity the percentage of students skipping will increase and students might not even show up to school.

We also have to think about the teachers ,you are obviously going to need a teacher to stay with the student for whatever curricular activity they get assigned to but believe it or not teachers have a life outside of school. They might have kids that they need to take care of , they might have a parttime job and they also need to look out for themselves too. What if they want to go to the gym but they can't because they have to stay after school with a couple of students so honestly it wouldn't really be fair to the teachers.

The majority of students wake up really early to go to school and when they arrive at school they are tired and exhausted so when they leave they wont be thinking about stay for an activity they will be thinking of going home and laying in bed. We all have the right to do what we want as long as its legal so as a citizen the students have a right to make the choice of joining a extracurricular activity or just going home and do whatever they want. There are many reasons why students should participate in an extracurricular activity but there are also many other reason why they shouldn't.

There for I think students should not participate in extracurricular activities because at the end of the day they are just kids and they wont have much energy after being in school for about eight hours. We should think about both teachers and stduents. I really think that students should have the choice to join a extracurricular activity or not and not have the principle choose for them.                                                                                                                                                                                                       ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
7483884E9EA6,"Countless students follow the same after-school routine. After a long day at school, they joyfully return home with a smile on their face. That happiness is because while they were forced to learn and work at school, there are no expectations like that at home. As the sun rises and sets, they have the freedom to mindlessly waste the rest of the day away. That's why rather than spending time outdoors, focusing on hobbies, or spending time with friends and family, students just lock themselves into their rooms. Then, they proceed to pull out their electronics and play away until the end of the day. It's an extremely unhealthy yet addictive lifestyle. But, that lifestyle could change if students had an after-school activity to attend. They would start spending more attention to what's outside of the virtual world. Thus, it is my firm belief that every student should be required to participate in an least one extracurricular activity because it will increase student productivity, improve students' social skills, and promote student engagement.

If an extracurricular activity became a requirement, students would have a more beneficial activity to attend after-school. Every day, when school comes to an end, many students find themselves with hours and hours of free time. However, they end up accomplishing nothing because they have no tasks to complete and no activities to participate in. So, they turn to their main source of entertainment- electronics. And while students are fortunate enough to have the entire day to spend on their phones and computers, no good comes out of it. That's why extracurricular activities are necessary. Students may resent it at first, but in the long run it will create significant improvements to their lifestyle. Students could spend their free time on activities more worthwhile. They could be winning a soccer championship or fund raising for those in need. The entire world is there for students to explore and discover. All students need is a small push in the right direction.

Furthermore, extracurricular activities also give students opportunities to interact with their peers. It can be intimidating for students when they have to join a group of complete strangers. However, although it is nerve-wracking, students have the wonderful opportunity to make new friends. Their team will contain people of a similar age group and perhaps similar interests. Besides, with how frequent meetings are, members will be spending an abundance of time together; they're guaranteed to form new friendships. On the contrary, extracurricular activities also help maintain current friendships. It can be difficult to meet up with friends out of school, so joining an extracurricular activity allows students to get together more often. All in all, as it goes with any team, members form a tight bond with one another. By the end of the year, they'll be surprised by the amount of new friends they've made.

Lastly, extracurricular activities promote students' engagement with their community. Students rarely ever have an opportunity to venture beyond their small school environment, which consequently limits the amount of change they're able to make. However, with extracurricular activities, students will have more opportunities to make an impact on their community. For example, being a part of the student council gives you many opportunities to make a difference. Members raise awareness of issues, fund raise for the needy, and even more. Being active in a team like that motivates students. With all they accomplish, they being to feel much more productive and hence acquire a sense of belonging. That results in students truly believing they can make a difference in the world, which then causes them to become more engaged and active in their community.

It's common knowledge that extracurricular activities are extremely beneficial, yet many students still hesitate from participating and consequently miss out on amazing opportunities. Extracurricular activities have a much larger role than just providing entertainment. They allow students to become more productive, social, and active in their community. We can't allow students to miss out on a chance to build those skills. The experiences they obtain from the extracurricular activities will stick with them for life. Therefore, if participating becomes a requirement, our world will become a much better place. Students may have their doubts about extracurricular activities, but they will truly be tremendously changed by them. The requirement of extracurricular activities will allow our world to raise much healthier and productive generations. With just a simple requirement, the future of our society will look much brighter.     ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
BC56873E3D8D,"I do agree with the principal making every student do a extracurricular activity. Because its a way for them to make new friends that have the same interest. Also they could find a new talent or a hidden talent from taking pictures for the year book. You could also become in a club because of the activity that your doing.

If your doing a sport its a great way the get exercise. Like if you did soccer you could get better with your running skills. Also if you did basketball you can use your body more witch causes you to get strong. If you do play a sport and your stress you can let it go when you play like you can shoot the basketball or you can kick the soccer ball. You also make new friends that become like a family.

Student council is fun you get to do lots of stuff with your school. Like you can make posters and hang them around your school that say ice cream social in one day. You can also make a poster about you running to be school president. If you get voted to be president you have to go to SCA meetings were you plan events to happen for the school and more.

The school yearbook is cool. Because you can take pictures of the school and students. You get to design the year book and the cover for the book. You can also take funny pictures of your friends and put them on the yearbook. It also can be a awesome memory when you get older.

Thats why I agree with the principal. Its a great way to make new friends and to let out stress so you can have a good time and enjoy the rest of your school year.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
57ED566E615C,"Ever been rushed around? Have had so much to do in so little time? What if you had to do a extra activity on top of that? Would your life be hectic? I disagree with making kids do extracurricular activity For example, time is something that passes all the time. Not all of the students can get a ride, adding this will cause the student to become more stressed. In all, adding extracurricular actives is a bad idea.

Time. 24 hours a day. Students spend seven through 8 hours a day at school. Should be getting at least eight hours of sleep. This is leaving on eights hours to do homework, chores, ride or walk home, and spend time with family. If you add an extra activity this will take away from time at home. Some of the activities are fished late at night or are held in a place far away so it will take awhile to get home. This makes doing homework hard or even sleeping hard. If a student comes to school sleep it will make the work that they are doing decrease. When this happens the grades will drop slowly but surely. When they see that there grade has dropped this makes them upset and stressed. Creating this viscous cycle. Forcing kids to do after and during school activities will make free time vanish into thin air.

buses are the way students get to and from school. People who live far and close can take a bus. Even walk. If someone stays after school there is no bus to take them home. The either have to walk or find a ride. Some parents are busy or can't pick them up. What do you do about this? Giving a bus to take one or two kids home wouldn't make sense. If you do this option it will take awhile to find someone to do it or to find out if the kid has permeation from the parents. If you give students the choice to do things after school they can figure out if they need a ride or if they do not need a ride.

Sols, testing, homework, grades, home life, drama, and family. All of these things are stressful. Life moves by so mast. Stress comes in and out of our lives all of the time. That is normal for humans. Even if we don't have stress in our lives homework and testing can just make you stressed. Making kids do something that that they don't have time to do creates a lot of stress. Students should be able to chose what they want to do. If they can handle doing extracurricular activates then they can, it shouldn't be a must. Making kids do something that isn't needed will drag them down making them now want to come to school. School should be a place of safety were kids can chose what they need to succeed in life.

Making kids do extra activities will make students have less time for home, not all kids can get a ride home from school, doing this will ad more stress. Do you have enough time?             ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
7B4FAE7A57C1,"I think that forcing all students to participate in an extracurricular activity would cause stress in many different ways. Students already have a lot of school work to do and making them do this would be difficult. I disagree with this decision because, students may have school work to do, may be a care provider for the family, or might have a job to do. This could also result in a lack of effort in certain things at school and at home.

If students have a lot of school work to do they could become stressed from not being able to get the work done. Students also might need to study and would not have time to do that, therefore, causing them to get a bad grade on it. This could also result in a bad grade on their report card, maybe even causing them to fail the class. If the students fail the class they will have to retake the class the next year, and if the students were already struggling with the class they would have to do it all over again causing stress in that way to. To much stress causes anxiety which can be harmful to the students self confidence, could make them sad or depressed, and many other problems.

Students might be a main provider for their family, taking care of family members, and paying for stuff the family needs. They might also be paying the bills or buying food and clothes for their family members. If students can't provide for their family they could become homeless or become sick. Might become in debt from not having someone work and make money for the family.

Students might also have a job to do and would not be able to work because they would not have time to work after school. They might also have a job so they can provide for their family or themselves. They might need the job to save up for college and schooling. If the students don't have the time to go to work they might get fired and they would not be making money to provide for family or themselves.

So in my opinion, I don't think this would be beneficial in any way to the students. This would be very stressful for the students and could also cause anxiety, even making the student become depressed if it is to stressful for them. I disagree with this decision because, students may have school work to do, may be a main care provider for their family, and might have a job to do so they can pay for the stuff that they need to live a descent life and not be stressed. That is why I disagree with this decision.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
DB4120B86224,"The principal at my school decided that all students need to take an extracurricular activity. How should I, as a student, feel about this? Do I agree with their decision? What is an extracurricular activity, and why did my principal make this decision? Figuring out the pros and cons of extracurricular activities, and how they impactthe students, will help me conclude how I feel about this choice.

What are extracurricular activities? These activities are something a student could participate in to entertain or captivate them. Examples of these activities could be an art class, sports, or even a chess club. Normally, these activities are something you personally enjoy, or have a passion for. They could be in school, after school, or maybe not in school at all. One way how most schools get you to take an extracurricular activity, is by offering electives. Most schools have electives as a fun class for students, or something they enjoy learning. Another reason schools might have electives, is for the mind to grow, and find fun in certain activities. Not everyone has the same passion, so there are many options. You don't necessarily need to be good at an extracurricular activity, you just have to love, or have fun doing it.

What is the reasoning behind the principal forcing the students to take at least one activity? Cellphones are one of the main entertainment for teenagers, them often spending many hours a day on them. Even if you enjoy using your device, it is not the type of passion most adults would choose. Making students do an extracurricular activity might positively give them a push to try new things. Taking an in or out of school activity may expand the students outlook on electives or clubs the school offers, and alluding for them to try something new. Going to these clubs or activities, offers new friendships as well. Other people that take the same activity as you, may also share the same passion. It is easier to connect with people who are similar to you. The principal would want the best for their school, and by making the students take an activity, they get new educational experiences.

Even though these activities can have a positive effect on the students, there can also be negatives. Some students don't care about finding a passion, or an activity for them to do. They might just want to take a class that gives them an ""easy a"", not because it's something they would actually do for fun. Not only that, but some students just try to get into a class with their friend. That friend might be taking a class that doesn't interest the student. Taking a subject or activity that is boring or uninteresting to you, won't help you find what you like to do. When forcing the students to take an activity, while it might help them find their interests and explore new things, it might also force them to do unwanted subjects that don't please them.

In conclusion to this prompt, I agree with the decision of the principal to make all students take an extracurricular activity. Forcing the students to take an extracurricular activity, can effect them greatly. It offers them experiences, finding what they like to do best, and discovering what they are good at. It can expand their communication with other people, and overall, make new friends. These activities, depending on what they are, can be good for your health. Some students don't particularly care about finding what they like to do, and would rather just be with their friends or use their cellular device. Making these students take an extracurricular activity, can make them discover new things that they didn't know or realize before.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
B1F95DB388DB,"Have you ever wondered about the benefits of students participating in an activity? Extracurricular activities can have many things to it. Some activities can be sports,yearbook designing,student council, and many other things that students can enjoy. Students would have a great time and enjoy these types of things and can find different kinds of activities they could participate in. All students should participate in an activity because it can help students find an interest,students can enjoy it, and can help keep their minds distracted from school.

Students can find different activities to find an interest/hobby. Students who don't usually participate in activities or events can find something new if they are being told to do something. Hence, making a student find an activity means that they will be searching to find one, and will lead to finding an activity they find interesting and try it out. In other words, students who doodle once in a while might find an art related activity and join. In addition, this can also help them keep an open mind and not think that all or some activities are boring or considering them as something they would never like doing. Some students might also be shy or not be involved to much in things so they might want to join an activity but are to scared to participate. This means that when students must pick an activity they can feel relieved and happy to do so.

Some students can enjoy having extracurricular activities. For example, student would enjoy having activities because they can be able to do something that they enjoy instead of having class. To add to this, students that are athletic wouldn't be able to play a sport during class because it isn't allowed and would be very disruptive. Therefore, when students are allowed to choose an activity that would make them joyful and excited to join the one they connect with the most. This will also be beneficial to the class/classes that a person is in because they have already done what they wanted during their activity and it can help them focus in their classes more efficiently.

The minds of students can be distracted from school related things. Students nowadays can become stressed, and can cause their brain to be less efficient. Students can be feeling down and even depressed which is a very bad situation for students since they have lots of things piled on them. Some of these things would include projects,homework, essays, and other things that can be personal to that student. Therefore, by joining an activity students can relieve their mind off certain topics and think about other things. While in an extracurricular activity they can communicate with others and can find new friends too. In addition, they can also find an activity that can help them relax and be more calm. For example, a meditation club (activity) would be very helpful or an art activity so they can draw out their emotion/feelings.

Overall, students should all participate in activities. This is because it can be appealing to some students and not so appealing to others, but this can make them find different activities/opportunities and keep them open minded. Students can also find new friendships and can be distracted from school related things which keeps their minds functioning. Extracurricular activities include lots of different things and students can enjoy it and consider participating in one or more activities. Students should all join an activity because it helps them clear their minds,some students enjoy activities, and it can help students find an interest/hobby.       ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I disagree with this decision because, students may be uninterested in playing sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on student council. Some students may not have the transportation from school after they are finished with the activity. Also, some students may have important things to do at home everyday after school.

Students may be uninterested in playing sports, working on the yearbook, or serving student council. These activities may not be easy for him or her to do. These activities may not be his or her thing. Some may never picture themselves doing these kind of activities. Some students may be interested in doing a different activity. Also, most students would rather go home after a long day at school.

Some students may not have the transportation from school after they are done with the activity. Some parents may be at work, and can't pick them up. The student's coach or another student's parent may not feel like or cant take the student home. Also, some students parents or guardians, may not have a vehicle to pick their child up.

Students may have important things to do everyday after school. Most students have chores to do at home. They may have lots of homework and studying to do also. They may have to get their little siblings off of the bus. Also, they may need to get rest for a different activity outside of school.

The principal should rethink about this idea, because some students have reasons why they can't participate in his or her school extracurricular activities. Such as, students being uninterested in playing sports, working on the yearbook, or serving student council. No transportation from school, after they are done with the activity.

EBF3EC9EA3B1,"I do not agree with this, if students were required to take an extracurricular it may not work for everyone. Examples are; it may cause stress or anxiety, students may not like anything that is offered, and If it's after school students may not have time for it. These following reason are why extracurricular activities should not be mandatory.

Extracurricular activities may cause stress or anxiety. For example students may be introverted and prefer to stay alone or with a close group of friends, and if their friends aren't interested in anything they want to do it may be hard for them to communicate to others that are doing that activity. They also might just not want to do an extracurricular activity, they might prefer just to have core classes or not stay after school if their extracurricular requires them to. The student may feel the need to attend every single meeting which may also cause stress or anxiety. There are two more reasons that an extracurricular activity should not be required.

Students may not like any extracurricular activity that was offered. There may have been something the student really wanted to do and it wasn't provided. The student may then not like anything that is offered on the list. If the student does not like any extracurricular activity they should not be forced into one. Forcing a student into an activity they do not want to do could be stressful on them or result in a violent reaction. There is a final reason why extracurricular activities should not be required.

Students may not have the time for an extracurricular activity if it is after school. Some students have things going on as soon as they get home, it could be another sport that is not in school or just going out after school. A lot of people usually don't have time for an activity that is after school if they are already in a sport that is not at the school. This could also result in not getting homework done or getting bad grades. The extracurricular activity could easily get in the way of these things a students has to do.

If a extracurricular activity was needed I do not think it should be mandatory. It could cause any of the listed things; stress and anxiety, students may not like anything that is offered, and If it's after school students may not have time for it. I personally think these are valid reason not to require extracurricular activities.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
10B5AC99E165,"After-school activities offer a variety of things, and students often choose to stay after school to enjoy them. However, being forced to stay past school hours to participate wouldn't be much fun for something that's supposed to be an activity to enjoy in your free time. Students should not have to participate in after-school activities, because some students may have other matters they need to attend to (family, jobs, etc), may already be doing a time-consuming activity outside of school, or may not have transportation home.

Students may already have things to do that take up after-school time: for example, they could be needed to babysit younger siblings, to take care of another family member, to do household chores, or to work an after-school job. Requiring students to do an after-school activity would take up this time, where they might be really needed.

Having students participate in things beside schoolwork is important, but not more important than family or work needs. They might be leaving a younger child alone, just because they have to participate in a sport or student council. There are things more important than extracurricular activities.

Students may also have an outside-of-school activity to participate in at the time. Many students choose to take lessons or sports outside of school. For example, they might have private instrument lessons, a neighborhood science club, or a sport team that isn't school-involved. These activities are just as important as school ones, and they shouldn't be forced to miss them because of requiring extracurricular clubs. The outside-of-school activities are often paid for, or require money in some way. This would lead to a loss of money for the parents, paying for lessons that the students can't attend. Students may lead busy lives, and they shouldn't have to have them taken up by even more school-required things.

Another reason school clubs shouldnt be enforced is that while buses and parent pick-up are often available at the end of the school day, it is not always the same when it's already been an hour after school. Parents also often have busy schedules, and they can't always be available to drive their student home. That is one reason why some students choose not to participate in extracurricular activities. But if students are being forced to stay after school, they might not have a ride home. This would create a problem, because then most of the school would need a bus ride home, and that would require a lot of buses and bus drivers. This would be very financially taxing for the school, so it would be better to just let students go home at the end of the school day. They have already been required to attend school for seven hours; it would not be fair to make them stay longer for something that isn't even education-related.

In summary, students have busy lives already, taken up by chores, family commitments, possible after-school jobs, schoolwork, and outside-of-school activities. They shouldn't be forced to add more things to their schedule. Extracurricular activities are meant to something fun and enjoyable in a student's free time, a choice to partake in something they find interesting. Making students attend extracurricular activities would take the fun out of it - it's supposed to a chance students can take, not another thing forced upon them. These students have lives to live, things to take care of, other time-consuming responsibilities in life that are more important than school-related ones. Let extracurricular activities remain as a choice for students.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Can you imagine going to school and being able to do other things besides learn? Going to school and getting to play sports during school can help with so many things in life. Going to school and playing sports like basketball, football and soccer and etc, playing those sports during school hours could be fun for the students. For the ones that love to play sports could have so much fun. Playing the sports you like can be fun but also can make you better at the things you do, it is like giving you practice outside of practicing with your team. Kids now in days need to at least do something active everyday. So therefore kids should at least be active of doing something for at least 60 minutes. So it is great to have kids participate in sports in school.

Kids working around schools with technology is also being active in a way. Yearbook is an example of being active and also doing activities. Doing a activity that involves technology can make sure kids can learn things with the things that they are working with in school. Most students prefer using technology anyways so it should also be fun. Technology has games and writing and reading and etc. Those things can help kids have fun but also learn things at the same time. Kids do need to read and write but they can also try to have fun with it if teachers added activities to it. Another thing that can help the students in school is to have at least at 3 min break but also use there technology at the time. These are examples on why students should have technology also as a activity during school.

School could in vise you to do better with things in life, or become the things that you would like to be some day. Helping around at school, could help the teachers out or help the kids become something the want to become. Working with teachers and other students is a great way of participating in school. When you are participating you are also learning new things. Participating is a good way for students to be active.

Kids should participate in things more in school. Participating in sports is a great idea during school. However, technology is an activity that student's could work on. It is also a better way to have students learn. Also the school could always have students help out with teachers and things. This is why i think it is better to have student to participate in school with sports and different activities. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
8F91417B8A7D,"School can often be full of work piling up in the classes we don't enjoy, and stress that gets us down. What if there was a way to make school enjoyable for everyone? Extracurricular activities are teams, clubs, and any other organization run by the school. Many students like these because they have something to look forward to while in school, but not everyone always joins. I believe that students should become a part of organizations because it gives them a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and choose an activity that they enjoy.

In school activities that are outside of class, students have a chance to create bonds with new people. Teams and clubs require working together to make ideas come along, especially student council and sports. This also builds a work ethic for future jobs. Sometimes students may have trouble making friends, so being in a club makes it easy to meet people. Similar interests can also often lead to friendships. Students can also get to know a teacher who sponsors their club better, as many students rarely speak with them in class. Having a more interesting topic to discuss with teachers helps students feel more comfortable around them in class.

Students should become more involved in schools activities. As a yearbook staff member, I know that from experience. I have been able to go onto the basketball courts during pep rallies to get pictures, inform people and work with them about buying a yearbook, and learn about other class when I take pictures and collect information from them. Similarly to student government, students are able to see their hard work pay off when fellow classmates participate in spirit days and other events. With sports, athletes are able to show off their skill and passion for the game while being able to represent their school.

Lastly students are able to choose what they want to be a part of. Not everyone enjoys the problem solving of math or the memorization of history, but it is a requirement to take them. If students join an activity they'll enjoy, then they will have something to look forward to in school. This can also strengthen career paths. If a student is set on becoming a business leader, they can be a part of yearbook or the other organizations that run like a business. If a student is determined to be in the NFL, then they can tryout for the football team. And if they don't find a fit for them, they should be able to make a group themselves. It's important to have a variety of clubs, including students' ideas.

In conclusion, schools should require their students to join extracurriculars just as they require them to take core classes. This is because it gives students a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and be a part of something that they would enjoy.

Students shouldn't dread school, and this is one way to make it better. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
2ECD72FE0B34,"I think that every student should precipitate in something at school. This is a great idea because students could get more involved in school and they can always know whats going on. They could precipitate in things like sports, clubs, and just any other extracurricular activity. This activity does not have to be any everyday thing. It could be once every week or every other day.

I think every student should precipitate in a sport or a club because it lead them to learning new things. Or it could open up new opportunities for them. Many students may not like this idea because school is already enough for them and they can't handle doing a sport or be in a club. I understand that but thats why all the clubs don't have to be school related. School can be very stressful and sometimes we need a break. So having these clubs during the middle of the day could impact how a lot of students preform in school. It could be a nice way to relax and get your mind off of the work you have to do but you would still be learning in a way.

This idea could also help build relationships, make new friends, and meet new people. At school on a daily basis you probably talk to the same people. If you are in a club or in a sport you would be able to meet new people and possibly expand your friend group. If you do not want to make new friends this is a great way to get closer with your friends because you would spend more time together and you would be learning together.

This could also make students find new intrest or hobbies. These intrest could end up being something they want to study in college. This idea is a good way for students to explore new things.

I know that not many students like this idea because they might think that its a waist of time or maybe they can't find a club that their intrested in. This could lead to them making their own club. So every student has a chance to be in a club or sport.

This is a great idea and I think it should be put into play. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
13989868021A,"Students should participate In at least one extracurricular activity. Children should participate in extracurricular activities because it would help them in the future, it is also is a great way for students to connect with new people that like the same thing.

Students participating in extracurricular activities could help them in the future. Collages like good grades but you would have a stronger resume if you did sports,or worked with the student council. Most collages are looking for someone that can do a variety of activities, doing clubs and sports shows them you have what it takes. Many adults have health problems due to the fact that they are not in shape and a great extracurricular activity is sports so starting at a young age will decrease you chances of having bad health problems. Sports are also fun to do, there are different varieties to choose from like soccer basketball,and dance. Clubs and sports can help you in real life situations. When you are older and start to have jobs, situations will come up when you have to work with other people and you have to be able to know how to lead. This is why extracurricular activities will help you in the future.

Extracurricular activities are a great way to meet new people and connect with others like you. In real life situations you want to know how to be able to talk to other people and the clubs and sports you join are great practice. When you are older and you have to try to impress people it will not come off like you are nervous because you have had practice. As you grow older you will not have school to make friends so you have to learn how to talk with people so you can connect and make potential life long friends. After school clubs and activities can help you with theses types of situations.

People might argue that some students might not have their parents to take them home or have enough money for sports. Most schools provide after school buses so you can go home. This can be a very big help for parents because they will be coming home from work around that time and knowing that their child is safe a school will take some stress off of them. After school schedule usually line up better with work than a regular school day. Money shouldnt be and issue because school do these activities for free, but if something does come up where you have to pay than you could set something up with the school that will work for you and your family. Theses reasons state why extracurricular activities would be good for you.

This is why I think student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would help them in the future and and they can connect with new people and make new friends.          ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
DEAF202F9EB2,"What ! The principle is making us participate in at least one extracurricular activity? I remember when I was forced as a kid to do that, I didnt like it at all. I disagree with this statement because, first off some students might not have time to do the extra activity's, secondly the students work hard enough as it is in school, lastly it might be the least favorite thing they do especially if they have to get forced into participating in extracurricular.

Well to start, some students can't stay after, they might need to go home and babysit or watch out for their siblings. Secondly, some kids might have hours of homework that they need to do, they might not have time for extracurricular activities. Lastly, students have after school sports like baseball or football games and they would like to attend to instead of playing or doing something after hours that doesnt matter as much as students sport.

Next, students work all through out the day with hardly any breaks, students want a break from having to deal with taking down notes and hearing a teacher talk for hours. Secondly, lot's of students are stressed out with grades and family problems, so why make them more stressed out by forcing them to do extracurricular activities. Lastly, students have to follow the rules and listen to teachers daily, as a result the students wont be able to learn when to make decisions for them selves if they the teachers are always telling them what to do. Students need to know when to make the decision to stay or not stay, not to be forced.

Lastly, some kids dont like to do extra things like playing games or sports at school because it will make them very sweaty and sticky, the principle is also forcing them to stay. An addition, since the principle is not giving the students a choice they wont like it, but If there was a option that the kids could choose then it would be more enjoyable because they can choose when they want to stay or not stay. Lastly most students like to kick back and relax and spend some time inside their home. I personally would like to be home sometimes after school and watch some movies and fall asleep if I can.

In conclusion, I disagree with with this statement because, it's not fair for a student to be forced into staying after to do extracurricular activities. It's also not right to be forced to stay, especially if a student had to take care of personal business like taking care of family. Principles should already know what could go on at a house, so they need to be more reasonable when it comes to adding on to a persons schedule. I still cant believe that the principle is making everyone stay and participate in at least one extracurricular activity.     ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
46BCC66EAE6B,"Haven't you ever been so tired to listening to a subject that you seem to dislike? Wanting a break but never able to since its for a grade, well your principal has decided that you can participate in an activity you might like! You can be in a sport, work on the yearbook, or even serve in the student council! I for sure love this idea! It helps kids look forward to something that might not be as tiring and boring as the subjects of schools, run around in basketball, be creative in art class, be inspirational as you work on the yearbook, or help others and the principals being a part of the student council! It all helps in the school system and you might make a change, for example, Generic_Name, a senior in one of the highest ranks high school in Japan, was a student councilor that helped hundreds of students from doing a bad choice, grades, or just be someone to talk to. The principal has announcement that is best if everyone has to join at least one extracurricular activity, and so I have come into the conclusion on how I'll show you on why I agree with this choice. I'll make you have something to look forward to each day after a tiring subject, make you be able to socialize more and not always have a standardized test that you might know, and finally how it will change your whole year and make you have something to talk about after you graduate high school.

First, it'll make you look forward about something during your day. You might have had a bad day but then you might remember that you're going to maybe you favorite topic class and that might brighten up you day a lot more. It'll be like a small break you get other then lunch. You get to talk with your friends and maybe even your favorite teacher and learn new tactics in the class you might like. A moment class where you can relax and hang out and get grade in too! A lot of high schools, if not all, let you pick the class you wanna be in and you may have other choices too. It's a matter of your and luck but always worth it.

Second, I'll be talking about how you might socialize more. You might not get what I'm saying so I'll just straight up say it, you don't always have to be quiet unless, of course, the teacher is talking. You get to be in groups and learn from each other and depending on what your doing you will get a different pack. For example, if you were to be in a basketball team, you going to see different cons and pros on each player but you'll all will have to work with each other to accomplish you goal, if your working on the yearbook you will all have to speak to each other and work on the same task to show that sometimes two people make a better job then one. It can help you boost up your social skills and your skills with working with others even if you've never met them. Socializing its a big stage in our life that some are very afraid of and others not at all and this types of things will help you in case if you wanna make a business or be a doctor or police officer or anything, but communication is always the key that you wanna use.

Thirdly, this class may be the best of each year your in high school, you never know. It can be that class you'll always talk to your friends about after you graduate and have memories of. The class that brightened up your whole high school year into one of the amazing years ever, the one class that when ever you pass your old high school or have to speak about it thats the fist thing that comes into mind. That one class that cleared you mind and helped you with drama and other skills you might have needed to learn.

In conclusion, the principal has announcement that is best if everyone has to join at least one extracurricular activity,and so I have come into the conclusion on how I'll show you on why I agree with this choice. I'll make you have something to look forward to each day after a tiring subject, make you be able to socialize more and not always have a standardized test that you might know, and finally how it will change your whole year and make you have something to talk about after you graduate high school.

690713606EEF,"I disagree because students don't only like sport or making year books and student council students also want to try other things like art, music, computers. Students like other things not all students like the same things. There are other things to try out extracurricular activities. I think the principal should think about other extracurricular activities.

Like other schools don't have only 3 extracurricular activities there are other extracurricular activities to think of like I said their's art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer, science, math, reading, writing, anything else not only sports making year books or student council if they repeat all 3 extracurricular activites that dumb boring and

Maybe some students may agree with these decisions some student will not argee because not all students share the same personality or have something in common and some students like sports some don't some students don't like making year books some students don't like student counciling. In my personal opinion art is a activity I want.

There are many extracurricular activites I want to do I would do art reading and drama because I love to draw I love to read marvel comics especially Dr. Strange Spider-man Guardians of the galaxy and black panther I love drama because I am going to be a actor, and a director when I grow up and I know a lot of students don't only want to do sports malking year book or student council students love other things. I know a lot of students and people opinion.

If you must participate in one of these extracurricular activities well everybody will think schools boring but the thing is it's the principal decision and chose if he or she want all the students to participate in at least all 3 extracurricular activity then you really have no chose but anyone can still disagree on all extracurricular activities maybe you can ask the principal if you dont want to do any of the activities.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
190A7CF741CE,"I disagree that student should have to do a activity after school or club or sports. After school students might can't do after school do to family problems, stressed, or just don't want to do those things. I also disagree because you can't force a person who dosen't want to do something you want them to do for after school.

family problems, a lot of student go through alot when it comes to family and just don't have the time because earthier something tradect happened or someone in there family died and thats hard on student when it comes to a family member dyeing or something bad happens. some students dont also have the time because there parent have to work and the student has to watch its brother or sister and just cant saty after school because of that. Student Can't stay after school because there parents need help around the house after school and sometimes they don't have a ride to get home or they don't have a bus to ride.

After school a lot of student are stressed because of school work, grades and homework. At school you sometimes a lot of classes and you just get really stressed because you can't keep up with the school work. Grades are a big factor at school because without good grades you sometimes can't do the stuff you want to and the grade affects some of your stuff. homework some kids dont have the time to stay after school because they have a lot of homework and sometimes home work affects your after school activities. Stressed is one of the biggest factors of not wanting to do after school.

Some students are not good at a lot of thing like sports, or clubs or they just dont like those things. Student shouldn't be forced to do something that they arent good at. sometimes they don't know what to do or they could get embarrassed in front of the kid that are good at it. They could make fun of those kids and laugh at them because they are not good at it what they were forced too do after school.

62D832A8630C,"Did you know that one out of every four schools don't let students participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that this is unfair and students should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Imagine not being able to participate in many fun skill-learning activities.

While others believe that participating in an extracurricular activity is a waste of time, I believe that it is not.

I agree with the principal, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity for reasons such as, it will make school a better place for students to be in, it will be a chance for students to make more friends or meet new people and kids will improve their skills or learn new skills.

Extracurricular activities will make school a better place for students to attend. It will also encourage kids to want to go to school everyday because they will be looking forward to that one or more extracurricular activity. Many kids don't want to attend school everyday because they have so much things going on like homework, projects, tests etc. Extracurricular activities will help relief the stress many kids go through everyday, it will get their mind off all the things going on at home. When I was having a bad day at school, I always remembered that I was going to stay after school for Art club that day and that cheered me up.

Extracurricular activities will also be the chance for students to make friends and meet new people. It is most likely the kids you meet in that extracurricular activity will be interesting in the same thing as you are. For example if you meet someone that likes and plays the same sport as you, you guys will have something in common. One time I attended the Spanish Culture club and I met a lot of new people that I had in common with, everyone spoke Spanish and was from South America.

Extracurricular activities will improve kids skills or teach them new skills. It is good for a kid to know many skills because it will help them later in life, it doesn't hurt to learn new skills or to improve them. When I joined my school's dance team I learned a lot of new skills, for example turns, jumps, new choreography etc. I also improved how flexible I was and how far I could do my splits. By the end of the school year I learned how to properly do my splits and also some jumps. Joining the dance team really helped me in a lot of ways.

In conclusion, I agree with the principal, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity for reasons such as it will make school a better environment and a better place in general, it will be a chance for students to make more friends and meet more people and kids will improve some previous skills they have or they will learn new skills. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
7DA61B775AB2,"Imagine living in a world where you had to do every single activity. I disagree that all students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree because not everybody has time to do activities. Most kids are still in school and get homework and have to study for test and can't ever do activities.

Here are some of my reasons why I disagree. Parents have to work. See not all parents have the time to be driving there kid places if they're busy at home or at work. Some parents have to work late so they can have money. Parents have a lot of responsibilities.

Reasons why we don't have time to do extracurricular activities is because they cost a lot of money. I used to do gymnastics when I was younger but I had to quit because my mom didn't always have the money to pay for it. I was so upset when I figured out I had to quit but I was strong because I can always do it again in the future. So sometimes our parents are struggling and we can't help but to quit. Just because our parents don't have time or money to do it now doesn't mean we can't do what we love in the future.

Don't forget about us kids! We have tons of work to do at school and have to study and sometimes projects for school and its so overwhelming! If we have so much to do how could we ever to do an extracurricular activity! Doing extracurricular activities can also take up the time that you might just want to yourself. Some people don't even like doing activities which means they would but doing they're not happy doing and it's not fun to do something you don't like. These are my reasons why I don't think that all students need to do at least one extracurricular activity.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
75843AB21505,"You just got home from school and you relax for a while then you are going to study and do homework. But you are forced by your school to do a sport or be in the student council so now you have less time to study. I think that student should not have to do something outside of school if they don't want to like playing a sport or working on the year book.

First being forced to work on something you don't want to do can put more stress on kids. Lets say if you are forced to play a sport and you have no athletic ability and you hate that sport with a passion it can make you miserable, you have to spend a lot of time with a sports team and that can really be bad if you don't like it. If a kid cant get his homework done because of something he is forced to do that can also put a lot of stress on kids not being able to get work done. If kids are forced to do something they hate it can really have a negative effect on them and their grades.

Also having to do other stuff outside of school that you don't want to do can take away from them having fun and playing with friends. Many kids now don't get outside as much as kids used to, and having them trapped not being able to do what they want can take away from them being kids. Having kids not being able to hang out with friends can make them not as happy and they can lack good social skills. You can see that forcing kids to do stuff they shouldn't have to do is a bad thing, this can suck for the kids if they have to do this.

However getting kids to do other stuff can help them get off there screens. Kids are playing video games way too much these days and getting them a new activity can help get them off. Playing a sport could help kids loose weight and be more fit so they are not unhealthy. This can be good but, making a kid play a sport they don't want to do can make it so they don't try in the sport and don't give any effort because they don't like it. No one wants to play a sport they are not good at. This is why kids should not be forced to do something they don't need to do.

Now you can see how making kids do something they don't need to do is bad. I think schools should not make kids do something school related that doesn't count towards grades. I hope schools don't do this and that kids can just be themselves.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
815AB04BFBF3,"If you had to participate in an extracurricular activity, what would you choose to do? You have to pick because the principal said all of the students in the school have to participate. You may have reasons to not do it, but there are some reasons why you should. The main reason is you might actually like it and enjoy whatever activity you choose. So, I agree because some people may need the extra activity, others might wanna be more active, and some people may just wanna have fun.

Some students may need an extra activity. One reason is they may want to be more confident or build their self-esteem. They might want to step out of their comfort zone, and also may be trying to impress someone. The person might also need help with something important to them. They may be struggling education wise and are searching for help. They might need help with a sport or hobby of theirs.

Students may be trying to be more active. They might be trying to get and stay fit. This student might want to become a stronger person than before. This person might want to get abs or build up stamina. It might be a goal for them to be a healthier person. It'll be better for their body in general. They'll be able to last longer while stretching and running.

Most importantly, students simply just want to have fun. Students want to learn something new and exciting. They might want to learn how to play certain sports or games. They just want to have a good time playing together. They might want to play against other teams. The thrill of racing against time trying to get more points is amazing! It's also rewarding to have a victory in something.

Based on those reasons, I see the point of having students be involved in an extracurricular activity. It's important and you could have some fun while doing so. It's not a punishment, it's probably to make sure you're getting energy, learning something new, playing a sport, or joining a club. Since you could have fun, may need the extra activity, and you may want to be more active, I agree with this decision.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
003FDC7E6F20,"I disagree in having to make students participate in a sport, or extracurricular activity. Not all students enjoy playing sports or participating in a school activity. Not many parents have the time or money to put their kids in such either, and its also putting more stress on kids during and after school if having to join one.

When being forced to do something such as a sport or school activity the school has to find a variety of the kids liking. Making sure all the kids in his school have a place to have fun at and not just something they have to do and dont enjoy. Having all kids in something at a school can cause running into dept because thats a lot of kids you have to put money towards. Sports can run as much as two to a hundred dollars per kid for any sport, and when having to be forced into a sport that you dont enjoy why waist money. Even when the kids dont want to participate why even try putting your hard working money towards it.

Sports and activities for school are not free. The school has to buy equipment and tools for those opportunities and, sometimes not all parents can physically do that. Sports are a lot of money and when having to be put into one not knowing how you are going to pay for it can be embarrassing. Letting your kid down is the least a father or mother would ever want to do, and when working in the school board having to deal with phone calls from parents saying they cant afford a extracurricular activity would be heartbreaking.

Kids work really hard to put forth effort on school work,homework, and participate in school projects. That can be already enough stress on a kid no matter what age. When having to put another thing on top of school work managing time for sports, and extra activities sometimes kids just cant deal with it. Grades and having a good GPA can come first for some kids. Sports and other things come last. You could probrobaly already have something after school you do and having to move your whole schedule around can be really tiring and stressful.

This is why I disagree on having to make kids participate in a sport or activity. Its way to much work, stress, and money. So when coming down to a decision I agree with a no because having every kid in a sport or activity is absurd. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
8C79D66ECC0B,"My principle has decided that she wants everyone to participate in a extracurricular activity. In my opinion, I believe it's the best for students to participate in school activity. It will be a great way to have fun, make new friends, and get some exercise.

Making new friends is not always easy. Many kids now judge you by the way you dress, act or even look. For example, I was a new girl at a school. It wasn't very easy to make any friends so I decided to stay after school and join a club. As I was joining a club, I got paired up with a girl who was in the same grade as me.

At first, it was awkward but then we started conversations and we found many things in common. One thing that we found in common was that we both love dancing. Since then, we have been very close friends until this day. Participating in a activity was the best thing I did to be able to make new friends from a new school.

Another reason why students should join a activity is to maintain your health. According to WWW.stay. healthy. com, has stated that participating in a club or activity at least an hour per day is very important for your health. It is also a great way to distract yourself from any anxiety or stress you are facing. Everyday my sister would come home from school. She would always be overwhelmed with the amount of homework she had to do and complain about how much her neck and back was hurting. It was a hard time she was facing and my mom decided to take her to the doctors. Our Doctor, said that her body was hurting because she didn't get any excersice and she also wasn't participating in any activity to distract her. The next day, my sister decided to try out for volleyball. She was great and made the team. By joining volleyball, it helped her feel free because she was distracted by everything negative she was facing.

Joining a activity doesn't have to be boring or all about running . Activities are meant for you to pick them and do something fun you love. There are many activities to choose from. For example, I love doing pottery. My mom and I would go to a building where they would teach you how to make cups, any animal, and vases. It makes your hands messy but it was so much fun. Next year, for high school there is a class where anyone can take and it is called ceramics. I am beyond excited to take a class where I'm going to do something that will distract me but at the same time I will be doing something that is fun for me. When given the chance to participate in any activity, it is a great way to pick something you know will be enjoyable.

As a result, by participating in a activity it helps you maintain your health, have fun, and meet new people. At first, starting something new can take a couple tries until you get it right. In addition, once you learn it is the best feeling ever to accomplish something new. After learning it will become easy and fun because you will already know what to do.

It is also a great way to meet new people and make friends who love the same thing you do. Activities help you feel distracted and calm because you are doing something you love and no one is judging you from it. These are my reasons on why I strongly believe that everyone should participate in a extracurricular activity.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
62274F02BC50,"Some people might think after school actives are fun and some think not. Some principals think it is required for students to have an after school activity without thinking about how the students feel about after school actives. Students should have the right to choose weather to have and after school activity or not. Students should not have to participate in a extracurciuar activity after school because some students do not have the time, Not a student would like to be forced to do a after school activity, And not all students like to have an after school activity.

After a long day at school some students do not have the time to do an after school activity. They could have after school plans and can not do the activity they were supposed to do. Others have lots of homework to do after school although teachers say that would be a terrible excuse to say but every teacher does not know how much homework the kids have after they're class. Students after school might have to take care of a younger sibling or pet because their mother or father is at work or they could be doing something to help out their mother or father.

In many occasions students are force to do an after school activity chosen by the school district. Students are more likely to do the activity if they are to chose it instead of the school district. Because of the students disliking the activity they were assigned they would most likely to skip it and go on with they're day. so instead of forcing students to do an activity have options for them so they can pick for themselves.

Some students just do not like after school actives and they do not have a reason why they just don't. The students would rather study for and up coming test or quiz. They are stay at home kids they go to school and come back home to do whatever they need to do to pass school. Their is no explanation but they just dislike actives after school and if they do not like it then they should not be force to do something they do not want to do. they want to take the time to study and pass the grade instead of doing an after school activity.

After school actives can be every difficult to do for some students because some dont have the time, they would not like to be forced to do it,and some kids just do not like it at all. These are just some reasons on why not give after school actives to students but there are many more, people just do not think about how busy the life of a student is. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
D66B89FC3757,"When you think about school its just a boring place that seems like jail. Its not always like that when you could do extracurricular activities. Sometimes when do activities in school it could make school something that you look forward to doing. You could even do sports and just go to them after school. I think it is always good to do at least one extracurricular activity.

There are a lot of advantages to doing extracurricular activities as well. You can pick what activity you want to do and you like. You dont have to pick one that you dont like because then it wouldnt be fun. When you do an activity for school it will be on your reputation for other schools. If you do a sport then you can stay in shape and get some exercise.

When you choose a extra curricular activity there is a lot to choose from. You could help the school and be a library worker for you school. You could be a student council and help people around your school in your free time. When doing a extracurricular activity you can even work on the yearbook for your schools yearbook. After school you can do sports like swim, basketball, softball, baseball and tennis etc.

Sometimes there are some disadvantages in extracurricular activity but not a lot. Sometimes you have to pay a lot of money for what you want to do. If you pick an activity you already paid for then it would be hard to stop doing. Sometimes maybe you dont like the activity you picked. When doing a sport after school you might not have time to do home work or you just dont have time at all to do an extracurricular activity.

In conclusion I think you should do at least one extra curricular activity. When your in school, on the weekends, or even when you get out of school. When I thought of an extracurricular activity I thought they were boring until I looked into it. There are so many options you could do for an extracurricular activity. You could do classes, sports, be a volunteer, or just be a yearbook worker or a library worker at your school.         ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
D92E4A5DAA55,"Have you ever struggled in a certain activity, or just wanted to join a new club.

Many students often feel that way and don't know what to do, but there are many after school clubs that help out in that regard. Students who are struggling in certain subject could stay after school with a teacher to help in that situation. Many schools also provide sport clubs so that students interested would join, and possible lend them a scholarship into collage. Students who participate in extracurricular activities are more likely to make stronger bonds with others. With so many benefits to staying after school, I believe that students should stay after school in at least one club.

There are many instances in which students struggle to keep high grades up, and don't know what to do. There are many extracurricular activities that may help in that scenario. Students can find clubs in which they can get help by teachers to do work there struggling to finish.

If a student missed a day of school and can't catch up, teachers can stay after and show them and important information that they missed. Tests can bring stress to students , and even make them panic a little, when that happens students can request that teacher help them and even give tips on how to relax and focus. Trying to juggle so many things at once can be difficult for most students, but teachers are there to help out those in need.

Sport clubs are one of the most popular clubs in some schools, and for good reason. Clubs like these offer students a chance to play the sport they like and represent the school at the same time. Sport clubs also give participants the opportunity to hang out with friends and create new ones along the way. In some rare chances collages may offer them a fully paid scholarship if they see the student overall success, and while it even rarer some professionals may be interested and ask them to join there team. Sports clubs offer students many opportunities to get a head start in life and even get them interested in new hobbies.

Students coming to a new school for the first time might be timid or feel alone during the first few day, so why not ask them to come to after school. Extracurricular activities offer new students the change to make new friends and even help strengthen old ones. Many group of friends often hang out after school to just hang out or relax from the stressful day. Many clubs also relate to specific peoples interest, so people can meet others who are interested in their hobbies. Every person is unique and some may struggle to make new bonds, but after school activities can help them meet people who share the same hobbies or help steanthen bonds

After school clubs are some of the key factors in schools. They help them keep high grades, Gives students the chance to do there hobbies like sport, and may even help new kids to make bonds or steanthen them. So I Believe that students should stay after school at least once, to see new interest or make new friends.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Generic_Name struggles with making friends. Her mother suggested that she try an extracurricular activity, but Generic_Name doesn't like sports. Sports aren't the only option though, there are clubs like chess club, student council, yearbook or debate. This is a good chance for Generic_Name to make some friends. Many students don't do anything after school. If the students don't have an extracurricular activity then they seem less active with other people. Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it keeps the students off their electronic devices, makes the students more active with others, and it helps the students to stay out of trouble.

First, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it will keep the students off their electronic devices. People today are very absorbed in their devices. Apps like Instagram, Tik Tok, Facebook, and YouTube keep people entertained for hours. When students dont have an extracurricular activity then they are more likely to get on their devices for many hours. If students were to go to an extracurricular activity then they could be more involved in the real world and not crammed inside there house on their phone for hours.

Second, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it makes the students more active with other people. Many people struggle with interacting with others, but an extracurricular activity can help students to meet new people. Being in an extracurricular activity will help students to make new friends. Most of these activities require students to interact so they will have to make friends. Having friends in school makes their time there more enjoyable. Going out of the students comfort zone is a part of life they are going to have to do things that make them uncomfortable.

Last, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it helps the students stay out of trouble. Students are more likely to get into trouble when the aren't in a extracurricular activity because, they may get bored and just go and make some bad decisions. Many students feel peer pressure to do bad things. Extracurricular activities can help create a positive influence on people. Students sometimes feel like they have to be like this or be like that but, the students just need to be themselves.

Just like Generic_Name students can explore new activities to make friends. Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it keeps the students off their electronic devices, makes the students more active with others, and it helps the students to stay out of trouble. Push students to join these extracurricular activities so they can explore what they like to do, and what they dont like to do. If students never get out of their comfort zone then that wont get anywhere in life. Extracurricular activities are good for the students. It gives the students something to look forward to at the end of the day. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
EE90061719C2,"Extracurricular activities, such as playing sports, instruments, and joining after school clubs are highly encouraged by adults and teachers for growing adolecents. Recently, the principal of the Generic_School stated all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I believe forcing students to join a club activity will be unnecessary, unproductive, and inefficient considering the cost and the effort. There is not enough data and evidence to ensure that all students will like their activities, it will create a fair cooperation and competition environment among diverse groups of students, and finally to prove that every student will enjoy extracurricular activities.

My first argument is that it will force students to participate in an activity that they might not enjoy which is unhealthy. My current school, Generic_School, does not have unlimited budget, faculty members, and space for different club activities. With very limited resources, the school will much prefer to establish more popular clubs than smaller clubs. Options that the school offer may not serve everyone's interest, but students will still need to choose an unappealing activity because it is mandotary. For example, when I was at a camp last summer, I was asked to choose five different activities. However, they did not offer all the courses I wanted and I ended up joining the swimming class which is my least favorite sport. From my own personal experience, I concern how some students might lose their interests or end up disliking their chosen clubs activities.

Secondly, the plan seems unfair for certain group of students and will develop an unhealthy competition environment. It will simply create a disparity betweeen students who can afford private lessons or tutorings to get better at the activity and those who cannot. For example, a clarinet player who receives private lessons and plays in a local band will be able to perform much harder music and eventually be placed in a more advanced band than his peers who cannot afford the cost. This allows an environment where certain group of students will continue to get better and others cannot. Not only will it pressure the students with unnecessary stress, but it will also burden their parents financially.

Lastly and most importantly, it does not necessary have to be an extracurricular activity as far as the students are passionate about the activity. For example, some people might be passionate about learning foreign languages and cultures or solving creative math problems which are not considered extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are meant to help students find their hobbies and interests. However, for students who already have hobbies that are not necessary defined as an extracurricular activity, such as reading books or writing creative stories, it is not right to force them to do something that they are not interested in when they have already found their interests. Everyone is born with different talent and interest. For instance, I enjoy public speaking and joined the Generic_School Debate team, whereas others might fear giving speechs in front of their classmates during civics class. Extracurricular activities may not be the best option for all students.

Although extracurricular activities are known to promote adolecents' overall well-being in general, there seems to be more disadvantages than benefits to this plan. Because the school board has limited resources to offer, it will be practically difficult to make extracurricular activities mandotary and ensure all students could benefit from this plan. We also cannot make sure that everyone will like the activities and create health and only necessary competition among the students. I value some benefits of this proposal but believe that it is more disadvantageous towards students and that is the reason why I disagree with this plan.  ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Generic_Name's feet dragged on the concrete as he sighed, walking into the school. The building towered over him while casting a gloomy, gray shadow. As he entered the school, Generic_Name's so called ""friends"" ignored him and talked behind his back. He had known for a while that his friends hated him, but Generic_Name hadn't had the chance to gain better friends. The boys approached Generic_Name and start ranting about how stupid he was. This was the last straw. ""I'm done with you guys!"" Generic_Name yelled, and stormed off. ""Fine with us,"" one of his old friends said. Now friendless and depressed, Generic_Name wished the school day could be over as he trudged off to his first class.

""Alright class,"" Generic_Name's teacher said while students entered the room, ""Can anyone answer this question?"" No one made a sound. Everyone stared at the teacher pointing to the equation on the board. It was so quiet, you could hear the pin drop from Generic_Name's desk. Generic_Name knew the answer, but he was scared to answer. Generic_Name's teacher sighed. She said, ""Today we will start a group project. I'll assign groups. Remember to work together."" Generic_Name moaned and expected the worst. His group ended up being consisted of students that didn't know how to work together. They ended up arguing over everything ""What happened to 'teamwork'?"" the teacher asked, startled. Generic_Name answered, ""Well if we had more opportunities to work with other people, we might know more about teamwork."" ""I better talk to the principal for more teamwork opportunities,"" Generic_Name's teacher said, shaking her head. I agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make friends, increase self confidence, and develop teamwork skills.

The first reason why I support the decision of students participating in extra activities is that students can make friends. If students were able to join a club/activity of their choice, they would meet other people with similar interests, leading to new friends. For example, I have participated in the Generic_School Chamber Orchestra since 6th grade, and I met one of my current best friends at this club. I also have friends I met there that are at high school right now. I got closer to these people because I joined Chamber. All of us were advanced at playing an instrument, resulting in many similarities. Students with similar interests that join the same club usually have a lot of time to spend together, resulting in a friendship because they were able to connect for so long. A whole club could learn how fun it is to be around each other and even form a new friend group. I'm sure Generic_Name could use a new friend group right now!

The second reason why I support the principal's decision is that students could develop better self confidence. Some people don't try out for a sport because they are too nervous about what other people would think about them. If it was mandatory for these students to join or tryout, they could make it and see how good/talented they actually are. This results in higher confidence. A shy and low-esteemed student being part of a club and making friends could finally see how funny they are, making them happier with higher confidence. For instance, I have a friend that I dance with that had a low self confidence. She started making friends, and now she is very outgoing. Maybe if the shy girls tried out for the cheerleading team, they would join and become a preppy cheerleader stereotype.

The final reason why I agree with the decision of students having to participate in at least one activity is that students would develop teamwork skills. People who play sports or participate in clubs know that teamwork is important. A basketball team that passes the ball to each other is more likely to score than a team with one person doing everything. If students were ""forced"" to join an activity, they would develop teamwork skills that would help them for group projects. It would even help them in the future for when they get a job. There are very few jobs now where teamwork isn't important because people need each other to complete a task. For example, it would be hard for a construction worker to build a whole house by himself. If the school made it mandatory for students to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would help them with teamwork tremendously (especially Generic_Name).

Bounce, bounce.

Generic_Name practically skips into the school because he is so excited for Robotics. Ever since the principal made all students join an extracurricular activity, all students seemed to be happy to come to school. The building welcomed all students to a new school day. ""Hey Generic_Name!"" calls out Generic_Name's new friends. Generic_Name met them by joining Robotics. He runs to them and the whole Robotics team dives into conversation. ""I'm so glad that I have such great friends that have similar interests as me,"" Generic_Name says cheerfully. Everyone laughs as they agree to walk to Robotics together. ""Hey everyone! Can anyone answer this question?"" Generic_Name's teacher asks while the students got settled in class. Everyone's hands shot up, including Generic_Name's. The teacher called on Generic_Name and he stated the right answer. ""Correct!"" the teacher said, and Generic_Name beamed. He was proud of himself and his new self confidence. He figured out how smart and funny he was after joining Robotics. He also figured out that he was great at math, and even led his team to victory at the Robotics Championship. ""Let's work on our projects!"" the teacher said. Generic_Name's group got together and they worked diligently for the rest of class. They each joined a club or sport, so they figured out teamwork. They worked together to produce an A+ worthy project. The teacher said, ""I'm so proud that you guys figured out teamwork. The principal made a great decision!"" I agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity because they can make friends, gain self confidence, and develop teamwork skills.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Joining a club or participating in an activity teaches you team work and how to cooperate with others. By taking part in a club or team you learn the necessary life long skills like leadership and how to be kind. The skill used the most when participating on a team is leadership. All teams revolve around one person such as their coach or most valued player. By joining a team you are required to negotiate with multiple people such as a referee or just someone going against your ideas. When taking part in an extracurricular you meet people you never wouldnt've met if you didnt join the team or club. The strongest bonds are created with the people you have worked on a team with or joined a club at the same time.

Participating in a extracurricular activity helps to prepare you for the future. Working with a team teaches you how to work with others and how to be kind you also learn how to talk to others and use good leadership skills. When working in a team you learn life skills that will stay with you forever and learning how to work with others is an important skill you need to know.

3DEF59603E74,"People all over the world love to do extracurricular activities;so why not students. I agree with that student should do an extracurricular activities. First, I think that if students do sports they will get healthier. Second, I think that if students work in a play the students would be more responsible. Third, I think that if students serve on the student council the students would be more mature. In all, a extracurricular activity would be good for everyone.

First of all, If students do sports the student would get more healthier. When people do a sport they begin to lose weight. Students like sports because it build up your muscle to do stuff like pick up heavy things you couldnÃÂ´t pick up before. Another reason students like sport is it helps you build up confidence. All in all, sports help kids in a lot of ways like get strong muscles, get confidence and get you healthier.

Next, the students who work in the play are really respnsible. I think that because they have to remember hard line. The actors also have to remember their costumes and to do their makeup in a short amount of time. The backstage crew has to remember the piece of set goes on to the stage. Overall, students who are in the play really have to be responsible.

Lastly, students who serve the student council are mature. The students in the student council have to be trustworthy. Also the students have to be good in school like the donÃÂ´t get sent out of class and have straight AÃÂ´s. So the students need to be respectful and kind. All in all, the students in the student council need to be mature.

A9D4A57ADCBA,"Many people have at least one activity that they love, care about, or are passionate about. School helps many kids find out their strengths and weaknesses. I believe that our school should make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. This will benefit students tremendously. If these activities can help students expand their social skills, get new opportunities, and let them have some fun at school, then I think our schools should have this requirement.

First, we are going to talk about one of the reasons why the students should be required to be part of at least one extracurricular activity. That reason is sociability. If someone that is shy joins a club that they are interested in, they might talk more because they are in their element and where they feel the safest. Being in a club can also give kids the opportunity to make new friends. Students can learn social skills from working in groups within the club, or working with the whole club. Students might feel like they fit in more if they are in an activity where mostly everyone has a common interest. Depending on the club, there are multiple different ways that doing an extracurricular activity can help a student expand their social skills.

New opportunities and getting to explore different interests are a great benefit of doing an extracurricular activity. Students can learn about something they never knew existed. One time I was at a camp and they made us choose an activity that we wanted to try. I chose wood burning, and I had a learned a plethora of things that I did not know before. If the camp had never made me choose something to do, I would have never learned about wood burning. This very closely relates with the extracurricular activities. Students can get exposure to different types of activities, and may even find a new hobby that they enjoy. Next, we will talk about the third reason why I believe that we should make the activity mandatory.

The third reason why students should have to do an activity is so they can have fun. For many kids, school is work and stress. If they have a club to look forward to at the end of the day, it can make school more enjoyable, and maybe even more fun. It is also relaxing to have an activity that you get to do with your friends, and not worry about homework or tests. Some extracurricular activities may have fun projects or activities to do that students can enjoy. If a student is doing an activity that they enjoy or have an interest in, then it is likely that they will be having fun.

Having fun, learning new social skills, and exploring different clubs/activities are just some of the many reasons why our school should make extracurricular activities mandatory. These activities can lead students through a journey of self-discovery, and can benefit most of the students. I think it is the right choice to make all students do an extracurricular activity, and doing so will let kids enjoy some of the things that they care about and are passionate about.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
CFDCEE813DF6,"Have you ever been forced to participate in something that you never wanted to have a part in? Well, this same situation will become a reality for many students at my school very soon. You see, Mrs. Generic_Name, the principal of my school, has decided that each student must participate in an extracurricular activity. This means that a student has to do an activity regardless if they want to or not. If students are required to do this, then they will not be able to complete their mandatory after school obligations, spend precious time with their family, and they will have more stress added to their life.

First off, since most extracurricular activities take place after school, students will not be able to complete their obligations waiting for them at home. For example, many students will no longer be able to watch their younger siblings until their parents return home from work. As a result, parents will need to find someone to watch their younger children. There are also quite a few students who have the responsibility of taking care of their family pets once they are finished with the school day. A few of the tasks that come with this responsibility are feeding the animals, taking them to the bathroom, and exercising them. Along with taking care of their younger siblings and their pets, students also need to complete their chores. So as you can see, it is extremely important that students are able to go straight home after school, instead of staying after for an extra hour or two, so they can fulfill these obligations.

Secondly, participating in an extracurricular activity will pry into the limited and precious time that students are able to spend with their family. For example, most adolescents get home from school around four o'clock in the afternoon, and many of their parents get home around five in the afternoon. A majority of families eat dinner between five and six at night. Once you clean the kitchen up from dinner, that only leaves about four hours to spend with your family. Depending on when the students' activity takes place, that suspends the amount of time a family spends together to around three hours. That is hardly enough time to do anything together! A famous family counselor once said, ""Your child is a newborn for a month, an infant for a year, a toddler for two, an elementary schooler for six years, a preteen for three, and a teenager for five. Time is precious, so don't waste it."" Children are at school more than they are at home. The more time that is added for school, the less time that is given for family.

Lastly, when students take on an extracurricular activity, they will have more stress added to their life. For example, if Generic_Name decided to write for the sports section of our school paper, he would need to go to every basketball, football, and baseball game. Then, he would need to write a detailed report about each of the games that he goes to. Since basketball games are every Monday, the football games are on Friday nights, and baseball games are on Saturdays and Sundays, Generic_Name would be writing at least four reports a week. That doesn't even include if any of the teams make it to the State Championships. If another student decided to join Drama, then he/she would need to attend at least seven weekday and two weekend practices a month, four dress rehearsals, and all five performances. Plus, the student would need to stay after each performance to help clean the set and put it back into order for the next night. Along with all this extra work of being in an extracurricular activity, students also have to complete their never ending work load from school. With all of this combined, there is enough stress to give these students severe health problems.

In conclusion, being required to take part in an extracurricular activity will result in students not being able to complete important after school obligations, losing precious time to spend with family, and having extra stress added to their life. Having the activities are a great idea, but the problem is that Mrs. Generic_Name is requiring them. If she allowed the activities to be optional, then families wouldn't have to find someone to watch their younger children, those who chose not to participate would be able to spend more time with their families, and there would be a lot less stress for the students to handle. From what you have read, I hope that you will agree with me and take a stance on my side against Mrs. Generic_Name's decision for participating in a mandatory, extracurricular activity. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

1A14F52C0C72,"Imagine having to go home from school to have to do your homework, and then picking up your sibling from elementary school, then making dinner for them all while your both your parents are working.

You go to bed at 11 every night to wake up at 6 to go to school.

Now your principal is requiring one extracurricular activity for each student. How are you going to fit that into your already busy schedule?

I don't think that the principal should require students to participate in one extracurricular activity.

I think this because some students do not have the time to add another activity into the day, school should not control your personal life, and although some students might be doing the bare minimum, that doesn't mean other students aren't trying hard in school.

To start off, students should not be required to have one extracurricular activity because some students do not have the time to add another extracurricular activity into their day.

Although some activities might be in school, they add on more work and stress to the student.

Some students struggle to complete homework by their bedtime everyday.

Some students do not even finish their homework until around one in the morning.

Those students also have to wake up around 6 to go back to school.

That comes out to about 6 hours of sleep when they should be getting 8 or 9 hours of sleep.

The situation for every student is different.

For example, a student might have to take care of a younger sibling and tend to the house while both the parents work. Do you think that this is fair?

Reason number two for the principal not requiring a extracurricular activity for each student.

School should not be able to control your personal life along with your school life.

There is a border between your personal and school life.

Time is a precious thing.

If one extracurricular activity equals around 1-2 hours, then that will mean you will finish you homework two hours later, and that means you will have less free time to hang out and relax.

So, instead of going to that movie or dinner with your friends, you have to do homework and study.

School already takes up 6+ hours of your day, how much longer can they make it?

My final reason that students should not have to add an extracurricular activity to their day is that some students are already working hard for their age and some students are not privileged like other students.

Their families might be struggling to make ends meet every day and they might have to work a job just so their siblings can eat dinner.

They are already hardworking and shouldn't have to work more just because the principal wants to require this.

Adding this activity will just add more stress to the student.

The school is not aware of everyone's situation. I do not think that these hardworking students deserve this.

In conclusion, the principal should not require an extracurricular activity because some students are too busy to add another activity into the day, your personal life is separate from your school life, and the principal should not be able to add more work on to the stressed, hardworking students.

Doing something like this would not be fair.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I never knew what it was like watching those the famous sportsplayers on television shoot the winning shot. Without being pushed to do a new activity I would have never found my passion or met the people I did. Doing this has really helped me not be so shy and find new friends that are intrested in the same things I am. Persuing something you want to do as a job when you get older can start with a simple club based on the topic you are intrested in. Doing this technique can make you be very successful on what you want to do. Training for a sport you want to play proffetionaly, or doing things with construction and engeneering. Persuing that can make a great impact on your future. When you try new activitys you can figure out that you are most intrested in.

Clubs can really make a big impact on your mental health. It can honestly make you happier and have something you can look forward to.

D7CBAFF010CA,"Humans are like penguins. Just as penguins huddle together in the midst of a storm, humans huddle together in groups and find comfort and healing when they're with people that have the same interests. If that's the case, joining extra-curricular activities is a good opportunity to not only build life-long friendships, but also learn about different clubs and hobbies everyone can dive into.

For starters, being on a team automatically builds friendships and an unbreakable bond. A team is a group of the most valuable people in your life because members encourage one another and lift one another up. In many professional games, team members root for each other and help each other to be successful. When you see members respecting one another, there's no doubt about the friendship and love between the members. Also, people with the same hobbies become close very quick because of the same passion. I have met many of my close friends through the love of sports. Since my team had the same love of softball as I did, I felt as if I had known them for many years and something just clicked. Lastly, teams stick together. Through thick and thin, players stick together. Many professional players have been with each other for a long time. Since they've been together, they know each players strengths and weaknesses and how to help them. Gradually, a friendship forms and a life-long partner is born. All in all, being apart of a group not only forms a deeper love for the sport, but friendships beyond compare.

Second, anyone and everyone can be apart of a group. This is the perfect opportunity to try new things and learn about new hobbies. For example, many people didn't even know a club about learning sign language existed, but after trying it out, they became in love with the art of sign language and ended up becoming translators in the future. Also, you never know where this small hobby can lead to in life. For instance, one of my favorite hobbies is playing chess. When I was first forced to attend the club, I didn't know anything whatsoever about chess. However, I soon realized I loved playing chess and it was a good opportunity I seized. Lastly, everyone deserves a safe community full of people with the same passion. Research shows that those with a group to be in have a stable mentality and more self-confidence. Therefore, joining a simple community can even boost self-confidence and open doors to unknown hobbies.

In conclusion, being apart of a team or club benefits many aspects of life such as an incredible bond and friendship with team members, and a safe environment with other people that share the same interests. Something as simple as joining a club may change the way you perceive life. Just like penguins, everyone deserves a place to be. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
CC4B93E84451,"Having an extra curricular activity is a good way to find out what you like or dont like, or what you would to do later in life. It can be both a good and a bad thing. Having an extracurricular activity will help you make new friends, feel good about your self or just in general, and you can also be yourself.

While doing an activity you will be able to make new friends. At the activity you will meet new people that you probably have never met before. By meeting new people you are gaining new friendships and gaining new people that you can count on, and trust. You can also meet people that have the same interest as you. Therefore you will be able to do stuff together and will end up going the the same activity, and will be able to do things together because you both like the same things. You will also be bale to understand each others point of view. When people are asking you question about your activity you can both see where each other are coming from and can give them tips and tricks that they can use in the activity, and you can agree on the pros, and cons, the easy, and not so easy parts. While in the activity you can meet new people, make new friends, and who know you could both be friends forever.

By looking for an activity you can find that one thing that you love to do earlier and younger in your life. You can find things that your good at may that be sports, acting, singing, photography, and so much more. Also you can keep searching until you find something that you want to put your heart into. By searching you may find new things that you never thought that you would like. Maybe you thought that you would LOVE basketball but then end up loving pottery. Or maybe you thought that you would LOVE acting but instead you like singing. There are so many things that you could end up trying and loving them. You could also find thing that will make you feel good, may that be about your self or in general. You may play a sport and start to notice that you are happier and not in as bad of a mood all the time. They say that by working out and doing a sport boosts your endorphin's making you happier. Or even doing something that you love will put you in a better mood because you cant wait to do it or go back to it again, and therefore will have something to look forward to everyday. Therefor you can find things that you love and continue to do it and grow and be better.

However having an extra curricular activity can mean more harm than good. When you have an activity you may not have enough time for house hold duties or even your homework for school. Your activity may run later and you may get home late. The you will have to eat something if you didnt already before, and get ready for bed. But by that time you may not have enough time for your school work or the things that you need to do at home. But if you learn how to time manage everything that needs to be done then you should be okay. By challenging your self you are growing better as a person, and will be able to do things that may be harder for other people to do.

In conclusion it is a good idea to do an extra curricular activity as it will help you meet more people, be more comfortable with your self. Will help you get out of your comfort zone and get out there and live. Also find things that you are good at and love. And by doing something you love you are learning little by little to love your self.                                               ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
3B3DFE1192FB,"If you were a school principal, would you want your students to participate in extracurricular activities? As a result of their numerous advantages, many schools encourage their students to participate in them. My principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity can be beneficial, as it gives them a chance to make more friends, be more productive, and find possible career options or passions.

Offering students the opportunity to participate in extra curricular activities gives them a chance to get to know more people, and make new friends. When socializing during these activities, they can get to know people that they would not meet without this opportunity. They can also share their passions or hobbies with other people who might have the same interests, causing them to become friends. The third reason is that they might see friends that they do not often see during the school day. These activities cause students to engage in different conversations, and be more social around other people.

Participating in extracurricular activities might result in students performing tasks that are more productive compared to what they usually do at home. At home, students might be bored and might not have any tasks or activities to complete after doing their homework. As an effect of not having anything to do, they might waste their time playing video games or going on social media. Similarly, this would be a waste of learning time where they could be more productive, and could find new ideas or projects to do. These activities can help students see that there are interesting tasks that they can explore, which are more useful than using social media, phones, or other distractions.

Encouraging students to participate in extracurricular activities can help them find possible career options, and discover new interests or passions. As they perform different tasks provided by these activities, they can find new interests that they did not know they had. Different chances offered can help students develop a passion that they already have, as they might not have necessary tools for it at home. Additionally, adults organizing these tasks can introduce career options in the field of the activity to students who are interested in them. Extracurricular activities can assist students in finding which pathway they will choose for their careers.

As a conclusion, all these factors are beneficial for the students, which show that these activities provided by the school can help them with their social life, as well as academics and other work. It encourages them to dedicate their time and effort. As proved by these reasons, the decision made by the school principal concerning extra curricular activities can be beneficial and extremely rewarding for students, by providing them with an opportunity to make new friends and get to know more people, perform productive tasks, and discover what possible career options and jobs there are in different fields. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
738752DF2122,"Your principal has decided that all student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Should schools make students do a extracurricular activity, do you agree or disagree? I disagree, schools shouldnt make students do that because the activities are something extra for the students who want it. Another reason is if you force someone to go out of their comfort zone, theyre less productive. Lastly, if it was a requirement the schools would need more activities such as clubs and sports teams. In conclusion, schools should not turn these activities into a requirement.

First, schools shouldnt because it is meant for people who want something extra. People who do these activities usually require good grades. Others may be looking at something new. Then they're are ones who just like to do things so they do whatever interests them. This is why these activities are supposed to be something extra.

Another reason is if you force students or anyone to do something it usually means they're less productive. If someone joined a play for the school by force its most likely they will be removed because of either not helping or they're not working.

Lastly, if it was a requirement schools would have to make more clubs or sports teams. Schools can have a lot of students mine holds about 1,000 and they're are sport teams or clubs that are too large. FFA and FCCLA are competing clubs but if the schools make it a requirement people will choose them thinking theyll not do anything and ruin it for the ones who enjoy the club. Another good one would be if the school puts on a play certain people may ruin it by moving or breaking props or other impotant items.

In conclusion, schools shoud not turn these activities into a requirement. Schools should leave these activites alone and let the ones who want to do them choose to do it. If the school did change the requirement there would be a lot of people who dont work. It wouldnt require as much room to leave them as a choice.

742E4E5C94F6,"""I have nothing to do after school,"" cried Generic_Name,""I'm gonna be so bored."" ""You should tryout for soccer!"" exclaimed Generic_Name. Generic_Name wasn't keen on the thought of trying out for soccer. ""I mean, I'm not very athletic, and I don't have very good foot eye coordination."" Generic_Name said wearily. ""That's okay. Just try it, you never know, you might enjoy it."" Generic_Name said, trying to motivate Generic_Name. Confidently, Generic_Name responded with, ""Okay, I'll try it."" All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps students make new friends, it keeps students busy, and gets students get out of their comfort zone.

To start with, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps them make new friends. This is important because it can help a student who struggles socially. For example, say that you don't make friends very well. Joining a sport or a club will help you find someone who shares the same interests as you. Another reason is that it will help students become close with students that aren't in their grade. For instance, almost all school activities are open to all grades. This is the only time students will be able to socialize with the grades above or below them. So it's important that they take advantage of it. Lastly, it's important that students make new friends because it can help them become more involved in school activities. To emphasize, I ran track my eighth grade year. My friends motivated me to tryout. I ended up loving it and making so many new friends with sixth and seventh graders.

Secondly, requiring students to join a school activity will keep them busy. To start of with, when students are done with their homework they immediately go on their phone. To fix this problem, keeping students busy with a sport or a club will prevent them from being on their phone to much. Moreover, so many kids complain of being bored and not having anything to do after school. This is because they're not busy. To support my opinion, during track season I never complained of not having anything to do. I was always occupied either with homework or I was at practice. The last reason why it's important to keep students busy is because it gives them the opportunity to practice their time management skills. To illustrate, at the beginning of track season I was very stressed about how I was going to complete all my homework. By the end of the season I knew how to manage all my time and didn't have to stress on how I was going to finish my homework.

Finally, requiring students to participate in a club or sport gets students get out of their comfort zone. Getting students' out of their comfort zone is important because it prepares them for the work force. To elaborate, in the work force you don't get a choice whether or not you do something. You have to do it, even if it makes you uncomfortable. Another reason is that putting yourself out of your comfort zone can make you grow into a more confident person. For instance, I joined MAC committee when I was in eighth grade. Talking in front of a whole class made me uncomfortable. Now that I look back at it, it was worth it. I'm so much more confident as a person.

Another reason is that getting out of your comfort zone can change your point of view. To illustrate, my friend's parents forced him to join the art club. At first he thought it was weird and only for the ""geeks"". Joining the art club changed his whole point of view. He now loves art and wants to pursue it as a career.

""This is so fun!"" Generic_Name exclaimed, as she kicked the soccer ball. ""I told you, all you had to do was get out of your comfort zone."" Generic_Name responded. ""Yeah, you were right. I'm so happy that you encouraged me to do this. I've made so many new friends and found out I really enjoy playing soccer."" Generic_Name agreed, ""Me too. Soccer keeps me busy and off my phone.""

1C9F99DCD7E1,"Have you ever wanted to participate in extracurricular activities? Well now you can. Extracurricular activities are great ways to really get out there and show who you are. They also help with stuff daily like when you do an activity you can also learn how to do stuff for yourself every single day. I agree that every student should have to do one extracurricular activity because, doing actives outside and having to move a lot will keep you fit and healthy, when you work hard on things to maybe help your school it will make you think outside of the box, and extracurricular activities will help you meet new people and make new friends.

You should really participate in sporting extracurricular activities because it will keep you fit and healthy. When you are playing sports you are moving and this in an extracurricular activity. When you move and workout it helps you to burn fat which will make you healthier and more fit. As well as when you do activities that make you move you will have more fun and have a great time. There was this one time where I was really bored and had nothing to do in Elementary school so my friends told me to sign up for this running club where they do activities and really practice running. It really helped me have fun and, it also helped me get fit. So if your a sporty kid or not you should participate in sporting activities because you will have a lot of fun and will get really fit.

Working on things for your school is a great extracurricular activity. When you work for the school maybe under a project it makes you think outside of the box. When you think outside of the box your getting out of a small mindset and doing projects and working hard is a great way to practice getting out of the small mind set and really think big. When you work on school projects you must also work efficient so it is a great way to practice how to work efficient. In Elementary school I worked on the school yearbook. It was a lot of fun and I really had to work hard and smart so I could make the yearbook look really good .So if you can learn how to work efficient and use big ideas you can really do anything.

When you do extracurricular activities you are able to make new friends. This is a great way to just join in with everyone and have a lot of fun and meet new people. When you do activities in sports you can meet new people who also love sports or who have other of the same interest as you. When you maybe do and extracurricular activity for an art club you can meet other people that love art and then maybe you guys can become friends. I once did a basketball club in Elementary school. Even though I was not that good I still met friends who were just like me just there to learn. That is why extracurricular activities are great ways to meet new friends.

I chose to agree that that every student should do one extracurricular activity instead of disagree. I think that you should do extracurricular activities they will really help you in every way possible. I agree that every student should have to do one extracurricular activity because, doing actives outside and having to move a lot will keep you fit and healthy, when you work hard on things to maybe help your school it will make you think outside of the box, and extracurricular activities will help you meet new people and make new friends.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
109A06A4FB60,"I agree with the principals decision of every student having an extracurricular activity. Many students might disagree with this decision, because of some students not wanting to have an after school activity. However as being a student myself I have chosen to agree with this decision. When students have an after school activity, the activities that they choose to do can impact them in many ways. There are many reasons on why I believe that a student should participate in at least one after school activity. However, here are three reasons why I hold the opinion of students being required to have an after school activity.

Students will become more involved throughout their school community. If a student joins a school sport club they might be able to make some new friends. When students are able to make more friends they will not feel bored in a class if they have a new friend that happens to be in that same class. Students will also be able to know what is happening in other parts of the school, because of making new friends. When students are more involved in their schools community, they won't be confused of what is going on within their surroundings.

When students have an after school activity, they might figure out what career they would want to have in the future. For example, if a student chose to serve on the student council. This extracurricular activity can help students to decide whether or not they would in the future run for a government position. If a school has Home EC as an extracurricular then a student might choose to become a baker in the future. Depending on the what your school offers, any activity you decide to join will help you when it comes time for choosing an occupation.

In the future students will be able to reflect on the things that they have done in the past. When a student becomes older their kids may ask what they did when they were younger. Which is a reason why students should work on their schools yearbook, because they will be able to show their future children what they did in school. These students will be able to show their children the yearbook that his or her classmates made together. Therefore, being another reason why students should participate in activities because of being able to reflect on the past.

As you may now know the many reasons on why I believe that students should have an after school club. Like I said before when a student chooses a certain activity, this activity may hold an impact on their life. Requiring students to have an extracurricular activity encourages students to be more involved. I believe that the principal has made the right decision by enforcing students throughout the school to join a club.

EA4E4199A90F,"I disagree with this decision because not everyone does nor likes to do activitys. Some people like to do activitys like sports and yearbook but to force all students to do an extracurricular activity is unfair to those who dont want to. It should be a choice whether or not you want to have a extracurricular activity or not. I say it should be a choice because alot of people dont like to be active and dont try. If a principal trys to force extracurricular activities on his\her students than most students wont like nor participate in most of the activitys the classes will be doing once they are in the class.

If i where to agree with this decision than i would say that it would be a great idea for the people who do like to play sports, help with yearbook, and be on the student council. I would also say it would be a great opportunity for the students who dont like these activities because it would give them a chance to be active and to give them a chance to have an activity involving the student council or yearbook.

6DC91973041A,"Students should be given a choice whether or not they want to participate in extracurricular activities. While extracurricular activities may be beneficial for some, it is not for all. Students may lack a method of transportation while participating in these actives. Other students may not have the time to be able to put forth effort in these activities. Despite still being minors and most of us having food, water, and shelter provided we still have duties we must complete day-to-day.

Many students at various intellectual levels participate in extracurricular activities. They participate in activities such as but not limited to: Football, Student Council, and Yearbook Committee. Furthermore, each student who participates in these activities are rewarded in different ways. An example of this may be for Football players, if you excel in the sport you could be awarded scholarship funds and possibly a career. But, not all students need these ""rewards"", some students are fine as is. Bounding all students to an activity would be unbeneficial to students may already have activities un-school related.

Not every child grows up with multiple parents; Not every child grows up with a parent/guardian to supervise them while the other is at work; Not every child grows up middle class. Many students do not have anyone to pick them up after school, so they stick to public transportation. With the addition of extracurricular activities to these students plates, they many lack a method of transportation to and from school. Some students can't even walk to school because of how dangerous their neighborhood is. Extracurricular activities will not only cause inconvenience but also may cause dangerous unwanted situations unravel in these students lives.

As I mentioned at the start of my third paragraph, not every child grows up in middle class. Some families are extremely impoverished barely getting by day to day. So as soon as their children are of age they send them out to get a job. They don't do this as a way to hurt or punish their children. It just helps give their family more support, this way there is more money provided within their household. With extracurricular forced upon these hardworking students they would be forced to work less hours, earning less money. Food stamps and other government provided forms of funds for impoverished families can only bring them so far.

In conclusion, forcing students oblige and participate in these needless activities would cause nothing but harm. I believe it should be optional, you work hard at school and once the bell rings it should be your time to do what you want to do. But even so, we're still bombarded with tasks and left thinking before we go to bed each night:

""Did I complete all my homework? Did I study for my science test tomorrow? Did I sweep and mop the kitchen?""

AFF4F4ABC213,"Extracurriculars are activities that generally take place after school hours. These activities can range from clubs like Jazz Band or Latin Club to sports like Soccer or Basketball. Students stay after school to attend activities such as these for fun. Making these activities mandatory could create health problems in some students, take valuable time away from students, and ruin the fun of extracurriculars.

For some students, just being in a school building can give them anxiety. Making them stay after school to participate in extracurriculars would worsen this anxiety. Some extracurriculars even require extra work outside of school, adding more stress to the stress students already edure everyday at school. Requiring students to participate in extracurriculars would affect the attitudes of some students, since they are being worked harder than usual.

Some students' parents can't get off work early to come pick their child up after extracurriculars. Some students have siblings that need to be taken care of after school everyday. Extracurriculars take time away from student to finish their homework. For some students, it can take several hours to complete a single homework assignment. Students would have to stay up later to do their homework making them tired at school the next day.

Mandatory extracurriculars would create overcrowding in clubs, given that more students would be attending them. Some clubs have limits on the amount of students allowed in the club. More teachers would have to stay after school to accommodate the amount of students in extracurriculars. This change would take time away from teachers who have to grade our school work after school, causing them to have to work in their usual free time.

Overall, this decision would change the entire idea of extracurriculars, making them seem like actual classes instead of the fun activities they are supposed to be.

Generic_Name tell your son that he needs to make friends or at least join a club!"" Generic_Name looked at his mom in shock. Students should join a club because, it can help relieve stress from school, clubs can help you meet new people, and it can give you a hobby to do at home.

First, students get stressed easily when a big test is coming up, or if they have a lot of homework and can't do it all. Stress can make you feel unhappy which can build up anxiety. When I was in sixth grade I was not in any clubs, and during tests I would panic and forget the answers. I decided to go to the councilor for help and the councilor gave me some good tips on how to keep calm during a test. Having a club to go to can give you something to look forward to during the school day and make you feel less anxious about school work. When I was in seventh grade I joined the yearbook and FAC'S clubs. I didn't feel stressed during a test and my school work seemed easier than the year before.

Also, clubs are a great way to meet new people and make new friends. Somebody could like the same thing as you and you never knew. When I was a seventh grader I joined the yearbook club and on the first day

Generic_Name told us to get into groups of two or more and go to take photo's of the other clubs around, but I didn't know anyone. I was walking down the hallway with a boy, and to my surprise he put his hand out and said,"" My name is Generic_Name, I am in eighth grade."" I took his hand and said,"" My name is Generic_Name, I am in seventh grade."" Clubs can help you make that first step to say hello. In eighth grade I joined the Dungeons and Dragons club, I started talking to people that I had never talked to before. I found that these people that I have never talked to have something in common with me. I started to talk to these people I met around the school too.

Third, sometimes when you join a club that club becomes a hobby and you start to do it at home. In my seventh grade year I joined the FAC'S club. In the FAC'S club we would bake and cook food, then I started to bake cookies and brownies more often at home and I also got my brother into it too. Know even though I am not in the FAC'S club I still love to bake. Clubs can give you an opportunity to try something new, and most of the time if it is something that you like you start to do it at home. In my eighth grade year I joined the Dungeons and Dragons club. I shared it with my brother, and know we invite his friends to come play a campaign with us almost every weekend.

Generic_Name stood up and walked toward his mom, then opened his arms up to give his mom a hug. "" I am sorry mom,"" he said,"" I will try to make friends."" The next day Generic_Name came home and strolled down the hallway to his room. He came back out and walked over to his mom."" Hey mom,"" Generic_Name said. "" What is it Generic_Name do you need help with your homework?"" "" Well actually mom, I took a flier from the tennis club, I was wondering if you would sign it?"" Generic_Name smirked. His moms face lite up and jumped in the air. She grabbed a pen and neatly signed the form like she was about to win the lottery. A few weeks later Generic_Name's mom was sitting on the bleachers cheering for Generic_Name who is working hard on the court. Generic_Name took the last hit and swung his racket as hard as he could. The ball hit the ground and the crowd on the bleachers jumped in the air. "" Nice one Generic_Name, you learn so fast!"" Generic_Name's friend exclaimed. "" Thanks."" He gave a smile to his mom who is sitting down and taking in every second.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
917DE223C943,"I definitely agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For one, it would help raise their GPA, especially if it is low at the moment. Most of the time there is an extracurricular activity for everyone, like STEM, Home EC, Yearbook club, Shop, and so on. Extracurricular activities provide a fun alternative than just going home at the end of the school day. Students can stay after school, come before school, or even go during their lunch period to their extracurricular activity.

However, an injury or disability, like a broken leg or perhaps a learning disability could prevent a student from doing an activity that they want to do. Most of the time there are other activities that the student could do if they can't do the one they want. Sometimes, that particular activity could be canceled, maybe due to the weather if it is an outside activity, like a sports club, or maybe the supervisor isn't there that day. Maybe the student cannot go on a particular day because they already have something scheduled after school.

Some people might not agree that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. They might say that the student may not have time for it, or there is no activity that they like. If there is no activity that a student wants to do, they can just start a club for it. If they don't have time for that particular activity after school, they can just integrate it into their daily schedule. For instance, if they can't do it on a Monday, they can do it on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. They can also serve on the student counsel and perhaps get a particular activity listed as something other students can take. For example, if a school doesn't have a

Home EC class, the student counsel can possibly try and get that into the course list.

Taking an extracurricular activity is a good idea for anyone who: has a free schedule; wants to increase their GPA; or wants something fun to do. There is almost always an extracurricular activity for everyone. In conclusion, it is definitely a good idea to take an extracurricular activity whenever possible.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
22E3898773C3,"In this day and age of society, most students that attend middle or high school revolve around electronics. This is something that I think should change because some students prioritize using electronics over socializing with other classmates or friends. I agree with my principal, and I think that a student must participate in one or more extracurricular activity.

Participating in one or more after school activity in my opinion is a great way to socialize with new people, and make some new friends. Playing sports for example builds you as a team player, and helps you have a stronger connection with your team mates. I am currently training for freshman football at Generic_School for next year. Some of my friends and I go to Generic_School and work out in the weight room together, giving us a feeling of support from one another. During training, we are listening to music while we help each other out with the workouts we are supposed to do. While at workouts, we also get to know some of the JV and Varsity players who attend Generic_School currently. Doing football was a great Idea because of the strong bond I now have with my friends and the current high school players. When we have away games, we all take the bus to go to the other schools, and on the bus, we all talk and prepare our selves for those games. If you don't participate in a sport, general activities are great to socialize in too. Last year, I chose an activity which was out of my comfort zone, tennis. In tennis, I was in a group of about 7 or 8 other kids who I didn't know at all. But when I get showing up to the practices, and I kept making an effort to befriend the other kids, it ended up working out for the better. I got to make new friends and become good at the sport.

Participating in an extracurricular activity is also a great way to have fun. Even if the activity you want to participate in isn't a sport, you can always have some fun in an activity that interests you. Having fun for just an hour or so usually brings anyone's day up to a better mood. I participated in the yearbook committee in 6th grade at Generic_School and it was a great experience. I would have so much fun hanging out with all my friends while we were designing the yearbook and taking pictures for it. Now, even though the yearbook committee wasn't my first choice for my extracurricular activity, it was still really fun in the long run. I also played recreational league soccer in 5th and 6th grade. At the start of every season, our teams would switch players meaning I would have new teammates every time. This was a great way to have fun with different people and cooperate with them as a group. After every one of those activities, I would leave with a smile on my face, and just being there for that one hour made my whole day better.

Extracurricular activities can also teach you a lot of new things. Yes, doing an extracurricular activity is fun and all, but you end up learning a lot. In the yearbook committee, I learned how to upload pictures onto a document, how to format the pages to have rows of pictures, and to decorate the pages with cool designs. In football, I learn the different types of positions to play, the different playing styles of other players, the different positions to play, and I also learn how to train properly to play the best I can possibly play. In soccer, I also learned different techniques on how to be the best player I can be. Some activities teach you more than let you have fun, but if you like the subject it is on, than it, again, is a great thing to do. I think learning while you are also having fun is one of the best things in life because it is always good to learn, but it also depends on how you are being taught.

In conclusion, doing an extracurricular activity benefits you more than anyone else. They teach you good things, you have fun while participating, and you get to socialize with your friends and potentially make new ones. This is why I agree with the principal, and I think we should do at least one.    ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
C83A7FABBD07,"Do you ever wonder what it would be like, if your principal forced you to participate in an extracurricular activity? There would be much debate over whether it's a good idea, or a bad idea. Some students would agree with the principal. Some students would disagree with the principal. It's the same way with the parents. Here are three good aspects of having to participate, and my opinion. I agree because students can get more exercise, make new friends, and find a new hobby.

My first reason as to why I agree, is because students can get more exercise. Students get a good amount of exercise in gym. However, some students don't get any other exercise. Plus, it is always good to get more exercise. Students need to maintain a healthy body, because a healthy body is a healthy mind. Getting exercise releaves stress for some students. some are lazy couch potatoes, and need to get off their butts.

My second reason as to why I agree, is so students can make new friends. Some students don't have a lot of friends. A student without friends is like a puppy left out in the rain. However, forcing them to participate in an extracurricular activity can change that. Some students like making friends, but don't know how to make friends. Some students have a lot of friends, but want more. If there is a new kid, it would give them the chance to make some friends and meet new people. Therefore, doing this can change a students life.

My third reason is so students can find a new hobby. On the one hand, some students have plenty of hobbies. On the other hand, some students don't have any hobbies. However, most students have one to five hobbies, which is a fair amount. For the ones that don't think they have enough hobbies, this a great way to help. Also, this could help some students figure out what they want their profession to be.

In conclusion, I agree that principals should force students to participate in an extracurricular activity. Students can get more exercise, make new friends, and find themselves a new hobby. Students don't get nearly enough exercise in gym class. It's always good for everyone to make new friends. Also, you can never have to many hobbies. Doing this is good for everybody, even the staff. The staff members that participate will be working more hours, therefore, they would be getting paid even more money. If you think I'm right and made some good points, then show this to someone that can make this a thing in schools near you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
D7DD6B53B8B6,"The principal, of the school, thinks that every student should participate in one or more extracurricular activities.

There are lots of students that would like this very much, and others wont be as thrilled if this is to come.

Some students might not be able to participate in these activities, but will have to do them if they are required by the school, some students might have other sports outside of school, or students parents might want them home after school,and some just might not like what the school has to offer. Students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities.

Most teenagers now, participate in sports or other activities in there everyday life, so it might be a lot harder to manage school, an after school activity, and a sport outside of school. One of my friends has soccer practice everyday after school, so she has to leave school early to get there on time, but if she had to stay after school she would miss soccer practice, or she might level early and miss her after school activity. No matter what she does she will still miss one of them, but if she didn't have to stay after school she wouldn't have to miss practice or get in trouble for not showing up after school.

Parents might want there children home as soon as possible because they might have a younger child at home that isn't old enough to stay home alone or might not be responsible enough, so if they have an older sibling that can take care of them, they will take the opportunity. As an example*, I have a younger sibling at home who gets out of school around 30 minutes before me, and my mom dose not like it when shes home alone so when I come home from school I have to stay home until my mom comes home. Most of my friends have younger siblings, so if we all had to stay after school we would have to let our younger siblings stay home alone and our parents might not like that. Another thing parents might want there children home for is chores, if students stay after school they will have less time at home and wont have have time to complete all of there chores or get their homework done, plus some students may have sports or other activities so they would have even less time.

Then there are the students like me, who dont have any interest in sports or talking in front of random people, students who do this will have to participate in sorts and work on teams and will most likely put little to no effort in what there doing and are only doing it because it is required by the school. Some students may like to play sports and make yearbooks but they might not like the sports the school has to offer or they might not like the people on the team, so again they might put very little effort in to what there doing. Others might just not be good at sports and prefer to read or draw rather then run around, throwing and catching stuff.

If students want to join a club or activity they should feel its because they want to and not because the school is making them do so, students should have freedom over joining extracurricular activities. All in all I believe that it would be better if the principal does not make extracurricular activities required.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
4477F6E0FC39,"According to recent surveys, around 86% of students participate in extracurricular activities. Students playing sports or being in the year book club has been very beneficial for them. They can learn a lot from the activities, as well as representing the school. Participating in an extracurricular activity should be a requirement for the following reasons: Students will learn something new, students will gain life skills, and the school will see growth in their sport teams.

First, students will learn something new. Not all students have participated in an extracurricular activity. Students who haven't done so, will be taught something they didn't know how to do. When I was in the sixth grade, a couple of my friends and I tried out for something we had never done before. We tried out for the middle school lacrosse team. We learned a lot from our coach and went from not knowing how to catch the ball, to being pretty decent at the sport. Not only can students learn something new, they can also gain life skills.

Second, students will learn life skills. Students will learn to show commitment, leadership, and responsibility. My father was a really good soccer player in high school and college. He tells me all the time about the three most important things: commitment, leadership, and responsibility. He also made it very important that I knew about the hardships of being on a travel team like he was on. He had to commit to playing soccer in all of his spare time, always practicing, he had to show leadership and get all the practices and games and help those in need, lastly, he had to show responsibility by making it to all the practices and games on time and prepared. This is why students will learn life skills. Not only can students benefit from extracurricular activities, the school can as well.

Third, the school will see a growth of students coming to the school. These numbers help the school earn rewards and more money. When people see a school earning a bunch of rewards, they tend to switch to that school if they are in the same activity that is winning rewards. When the school gets more recognition, they will tend to get better players and will keep gaining rewards. One of my friends used to go to the same school as me but then he went to another school that had a better football team and was known for winning the division title. That school has gotten a ton of people to go to their school because of an extracurricular activity. This why the school will see a growth of students going to their school.

However, others believe that students shouldn't have to do an extracurricular activity. They also say that students shouldn't have to be tied to school any longer than they already are. This wrong for several reasons: students will gain knowledge and life skills from these activities, students will have fun doing so, and students won't be at school for much longer than the normal school day. These activities are not just there to torture the students, they are there to help them excel and grow as a person. The activities will also prepare the students for the rest of their lives.

In conclusion, it should be a requirement for students to participate in an extracurricular activity. Students will learn something new, students will learn life skills, and the schools will see a growth of numbers in the activities available. These are reasons why students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity. I hope that you will think about participating in an extracurricular activity.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
0D9011021C2B,"Do you want to be forced to work on something? No one does and if a school makes you do an extracurricular activity thats whats going to happen. If we have activities in school, then the after school activity would have to be after school. There is a reason why we have P.E, FACS, coding, and stuff like that. We have those classes so that we dont have to do after school activity.

The first reason why students shouldnt have to do extracurricular activities is because they could already be doing and activity. Whether its Babysitting siblings, playing with toys at home, playing video games, doing sports, or even doing a cooking class. Those are good activities, and even better, its an activity that they like. what if the student doesnt like any of the activity choices given to them. That could be bad for the child. Its like making a person eat when their full already, And to add onto this, The child could also be going somewhere already like out to eat, going to their moms house, dads house, friends house or a restaurant

Another reason schools shouldnt make kids do extracurricular activities is because after a long day of school or work you want to just chill and sit down, listen to relaxing music, drink soda, eat food, and all that good stuff. What if your school took away that time from you? That wouldnt be that great because then you have no down time. another thing you could do in this free time is study, do homework, and even work on some other stuff. this time could give student more time to complete and understand their homework. This would make the student more focus and responsive during class.

The last reason I have for disagreeing with making kids participate in extracurricular activities is because the kids pick up time would change. some parents that go to work everyday get sleepy. they want to sleep after work just like the child does after school. parents get sleepy fast and thats because they have a lot to deal with. If schools dont do this, than the after school stuff wont be a problem. another reason is because the parent could be working afternoon hours the day that the child has to be picked up. Then the parent is going to freak out and try to get someone to get the child for you. the next reason is because the parent dose not have enough time to pick up the chi;d. and the last reason is because maybe you dont have the money to drive miles to you son or daughters school.

In Conclusion, if schools dont make kids do extracurricular activities, then none of this will happen. So I say we should save the troubles and just not do it. Treat people how you want to be treated. I think this is mean to the children because I feel like the children should have a say in what they want to do.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
83B1E7A4E840,"I think having students participate in extracurricular activities is a great idea. Having students participate in extracurricular activities is very beneficial for your mental and physical health and has many advantages to the students participating.

One reason why being involved in extracurricular activities benefits you is because it's overall good for you. It can build time management which is a really important skill to have as an adult. Another skill you need to have is good social skills, and being around the other people in your activity helps build social skills. When you have good social skills talking to people and being social builds your self esteem and confidence and your mental health is just as important.

Participating in these extracurricular activities is actually really helpful for your future. Colleges love to hear you've done extra things. Even if you dont plan on going to college the extracurricular activities help you shape your life and see what you would like to do. School activities also help you figure out your interests and figure out who you are and who you want to be as an adult.

Speaking of figuring out who you are, being involved in extracurriculars helps build character. You can make friends with the same interests and hobbies. Sometimes, people dont know who they are and doing these extracurricular activities helps a lot because you can find your interests and your personality.

D376C98ABBDB,"Students may not always make the best decisions,but we still chose what we wanted to do whether it would affect us or not. We don't make all of the decisions, because we have parents, guardians, and sometimes teachers to help us stay on the right track. However, if a person is in a spot where they could control what we do,like a principal, than their decisions could make things a whole lot worse or better. If our principal forces us to do an extracurricular activity, than I would say

No!

The reason why is because, We might get stuck with an activity that we've never done, We might have to miss it because of other important matters, and finally if we miss it, we would have to deal with the repercussions

First things first, we have an extracurricular activity that we might not know or be familiar with at all. If the principal just assigned everyone to a random extracurricular activity(lets assume that thats what happened and that we could not change it.) than the chances of people particularly knowing that activity go down by a lot. If you are not a type of kid who hates to run around, or, you have asthma and you can't run,what if he accidentally enrolls you into the soccer club. You go up and tell the instructor that you can't run and they say, thats fine, but, the principal will be somewhat mad that you can't do the program. ""I guess i'll ask him to get you a different one this time.""Or what if you get stuck with a game like cricket. It is extremely hard to learn how to play that game, and it also is super hard for newcomers. If you were stuck with something like that, than you are not going to have fun with it.

Next one up, The game that you cannot show up for (After school activities).Lets say that you were chosen to be on the student council and you have a meeting after school. Unfortunately you have a therapists appointment after school at the same time. Will the principal force you too stay or will he let you go like he should do. You might have soccer practice for the junior league championship game that is coming up but you have to sit in a chair and talk about the budget for the Shrek junior play instead. It just would'nt work out with all of the problems, and also the fact that all kids are different and that they should'nt be forced to stay after and miss something important because of their extracurricular activity after school. I just feel like they should let us do what we need to do after school and not bother us with after school extracurricular activities.

Last things last, The cruel and unusual punishments for missing these extracurricular activities. The principal would punish those who either missed his extracurriculars or made a fuss about them. it would usually range from detention to having to eat lunch in another room. However, if you miss 3 after school curriculars than he would call your parents, 6 he would suspend you, and 10 or more he would expel you, (Permanently). He did do a good job of enforcing his rules too. He has resource officers and they will tell the principal if you have been missing out on his after school activities. The principal really is no joke, so i recommend staying on his nice list. Even though I still don't agree with him at all for doing this.

In Conclusion, No one should force you too do anything that is outside of your comfort zone except your parents, they can force you to do anything they need you too do. Other than your parents and family members,no one should even think about forcing you to do something because that is just a horrible thing to do. unless they have permission from your parents, I don't think that they should be able to tell you that you can or can't do extracurricular activities because that would'nt be fair to the people who actually enjoy them. As for the rest of us, we'll be fine her as long as we don't have to do any pointless extracurricular activities. So to answer the question, would you like to have to do an extracurricular, No! not at all, but some people might, and besides, thats just my opinion and i'm just a kid so what do I know.

CC06612E842A,"I think having every student be in a extracurricular activity is a great idea and i completely agree with the principal. Students might not have any plans after school, but what would be better than being in a after school club with a group of your peers. Or for athletic students they could be on one of the sports teams. Having students be in a extracurricular activity is a win-win in every situation. I think students should be in at least one extracurricular activity because, it could help students with their school work, it can be a opportunity for students to become more social and make new friends, and it could help students get to know the school and staff and make the school a better learning environment.

Some students might need help in some of their classes. So because of that reason they could be in an extracurricular club like study hall or homework club. Students could help each other master the material by reading it over with each other or quizzing each other on the material. If a student cant be with a teacher after school for whatever reason they could go to a student in their class for help. Sometimes getting help from one of your classmates can be better than getting help from a teacher. These are ways students could get help in school from having extracurricular activities and have more success in their classes.

By being in a extracurricular activity like book club or yearbook, it could be an opportunity for students to become more social and meet new people. Some students could be quiet and anti-social but, by being in these activities they could meet new friends and people to talk to at school. They could meet those who they share common interest like video games for example and could bond over those things. Or people who like sports and like to talk about sports. Extracurricular activities can be a great way for students to bond and get to know the people they go to school with.

Being in these extracurricular activities students can get to know the school and staff better and make their school a better learning environment for themselves and others. Some students might not know a lot of information about the school they're attending. But with these activities students can connect with their teachers and staff on a deeper level and get to know them more. This could also help them in the classroom. By knowing more about their school they could contribute to making their school a better learning, safe, and fun environment to be in. This is how being in an extracurricular activity can help students get to know their school, the people that work there, and make the school a better environment.

I think having every student be in a extracurricular activity is a great idea and it should be implemented into the school. There are a lot of great things and opportunities coming from this decision. It can help students more than just academically. It can also help them socially. They can connect more with their school and make it a better place.

3E597CFD9697,"Do you ever get bored at home after school? Also, Do you wish you had the opportunity to meet more people? Then you could benefit from doing a extracurricular activity. I agree with the principal deciding all students must participate in a extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision because there is a wide range of activities, there should be at least one activity that will fit a students personality, and it will get students involved with the school.

First off, there is a wide range of activities that should fit all students. For instance, the activates are accessible. there are many activities. Therefore, at least on activity should fit into the students schedule. They are accessible because of the range of activities, at least one activity should fit with your child's personality. With such a wide range of activities there are endless possibilities.

Another reason I agree with the principal deciding students must participate in a extracurricular activity is because it can help students be more social. For example extracurricular activities can help students make new friends. When I did a extracurricular activity at school in elementary school I met my best friend Allison, who I am still friends with today. Along with, extracurricular activities being able to help students make new friends, extracurricular activities can also help develop teamwork skills. In the movie

Moana , Moana and Maui started off not liking each other at all, but after working together for a while they became best friends. Another example is, students can get to know the staff of the school better. Staff members can share there none school related activities they enjoy doing to students. As you can see, doing extra curricular activities can help you meet some of your closest friends.

Finally, students can be more involved with the school when they participate in extracurricular activities. One reason students can be more involved in school is, they can help the school. When students pay to do the extracurricular actives they can help the school have better resources. Schools will be able to buy supplies and help repair and damage to the school that may occur with the money coming from extracurricular activities. Also, there will be education opportunities. The students will be able to communicate among themselves and share ways to improve there daily school experience. Lastly, students will be able to make school a more enjoyable place. For example the art club could paint murals around the school bringing a happier environment. Can you imagine how great place school would be if everyone pitched in?

NOT

support this; Because students should have a choice on at least what to do with their free time, but instead something like this would take that from them and pressure them, making that in the real world when they do have a choice whether they will do something or not they might feel pressured to do it anyways, or when they do get time to themselfs they would be confused as to what they CAN do. If students already are being given lots of work by teachers or have lots of chores to do meaning with clubs it would put even more for them to need to do makig the homework have to be done when they should be asleep because of they still need to do their chores once they get home.

Students would have a harder time making a choice for what club they would be in if they dont like any available ones, not to metion majority would would probobly pick the one that sounds like the least work out of them all meaning they would either have to choose it again until they can fit everyone into the clubs or put more into that one club which might take out funding for other clubs (in simple words it can easily and hevily backfire against them, and anyone that really works in a school probobly wont admit that it will definitly happen at least once but still it's a valid reason to put in).",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
1359D3CCD936,"Most adults who participated in extracurricular activities say that they have helped them through their lives. Although they might have helped them, some students never had the opportunity to participate in them. My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with him because extracurricular activities help students learn time management, meet new people, and they learn amazing skills to use outside of school and when applying for a job.

Students who participate in an extracurricular activities learn outstanding time management skills. They have to balance their school work and have to find time for practice and meetings. Also, they lean how to plan for things, and get everything done before a deadline. For instance I have to get my homework early for the days that I know I have practice or a game. Lastly, they will learn when to put their education fist and when to leave practice early to study or do their homework.

Another benefit for students are they meet new people and gain new friends for life. When doing an extracurricular activity you spend the majority of you days with them, so you end up gaining many friends because you spend so much time together. Also you might become friends with people who you might not have normally hangout with. For example I have made many new friends playing softball that I would not have normally talked to them.

Also by participating in an extracurricular activity you learn many good skills you can use when in class or even when you leave school and you're looking for a job. When doing these activities you learn good work ethics, which will benefit you when applying for a job,most employers look for a good work ethic when hiring. Also you learn how to deal with people you don't particularly like, for example you might have a coach you do not like or a teammate who you do not agree with. However you learn to work with them in the long run, and learning how to work with them will help tremendously when you have a boss or co-worker that you have to work with. Lastly, you learn how to work with a team and how to come to an agreement with them, you also learn when to argue and notice when not to.

In conclusion, I agree with the principal in his decision to have everybody participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree because the activities help students learn time management, they meet new people, and learn amazing skills to use outside of school and when applying for a new job.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
0426BE0F775E,"What if everybody did have an after school activity? Would it technically be a good thing? I disagree with the principle. I think that requiring everybody to have an extra curricular would be too demanding. There are also more reasons why I disagree with the principle. I will be writing about the reasons that I disagree with the principle.

Some kids don'd do extra curricular activities because they have stuff home and family related. Some kids wouldn't have a ride back home from these activities. Now, I know that your thinking, ""Can't they ask their friends?"" But honestly, is there every friend for every person who doesn't have a ride? Why do you think there is a such thing as a taxi now? And some children, including myself, live farther away than most kids in their school. Not many parents are willing to drive far away for a child that isn't theirs. Also, there are some religions that do certain rituals on a daily basis, at certain times. Like prayers, or temple visits, etc: Some children just have a bed time. So not every one could make it to these activities.

A lot of children that do after school activities have homework and chores to do when they come home. There would be a less likely chance of these getting done, if everybody had an after school activity. Some kids struggle while they are at school, and they use their time at home to study and try to help gain their academic skills. If they are like me, a lot of kids can't really focus at school and usually finish projects and stuff of that sort at home. Some children just can't balance school and extra curricular activities and either stop doing the activity, or lack academically.

Along with the other things that I mentioned, some parents/guardians of the students can't afford the extra things that go along with doing these activities. For example: A lot of boys could play sports like basketball and football, but there are expenses to these things. You have to buy helmets, knee pads, shoulder pads, shoes, socks, food for games, and practice attire. Even things other than sports require paying something. Things like art supplies, musical instruments, money for costumes or outfits. There are some after school activities that don't require money, but most do. I have met a majority of kids' parents that just don't want to pay the money for the sport that their child wants to do.

These are some of the reasons that I disagree with the principle. They are valid and practical. I'm thinking about the many reasons why kids don't do after school activities and why it is important to understand these kinds of situations. I have met many kids who has wanted to do a sport, but can't because of a valid reason, like the ones I have listed. You have to take into consideration why everyone isn't doing an extra curricular activity now, and be satisfied with the ones that try and/or do.     ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
4082B539D6E1,"Frisbee, video games, art, coding, cooking, and soccer are only some of the many options of extracurricular activities that you can take part in. Extracurricular activities require no sign up and no prerequisite, which is great for new students, for they can do it even if they have no prior skills or knowledge related to the activity. I agree with the decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it allows students to socialize and collaborate with their peers, as well as meet people with the same interests. All while doing an activity they enjoy.

Taking part in an after school or extracurricular activity lets you socialize and collaborate with friends you may already have, or students that you haven't met yet. Either way it's a great way to have fun and build a better relationship with your peers. Communication and collaboration skills are some of the most important skills in life. Going to extracurricular activities lets you practice and use those skills. Additionally, when students work with peers they share the knowledge and skills that they already have with each other, so in addition to what they're learning in the activity, they are learning new things from each other.

Extracurricular activities give students the chance to meet people with the same interests;

attending one or more of these activities allows students to engage with one another.

This is good because some students can be shy when trying to make new friends because they can't start a conversation.

Extracurricular activities gives students that are more shy the opportunity to talk to one another and begin a friendship, because meeting people with the same interests as yourself are a lot easier to talk to. This can all happen while playing a game of chess, basketball, or other extracurricular activities.

In conclusion, the decision to make students participate in at least one extracurricular activity should be a simple decision because these activities are a great way to practice life skills like communication and collaboration. As well as the perfect place to meet people with the same interests. This will also provide students who are more shy the opportunity to talk to their peers, make friends, and create friendly relationships with the people around them. Therefore, I believe all students should participate in an extracurricular activity, even if they aren't forced to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
8BFA8777316F,"Many school officials have been questioning whether or not students should participate in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities like sports, working on the yearbook, or serving in the student council can contribute a lot to a student's view on school. In addition to this, students will pay more attention to their grades and behavior. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is a great way for them to learn new things, get a break from learning all day, and get to socialize and make more friends.

In school, many students dislike to learn new things. By having one extracurricular activity, students will have a great way of learning new things. Sports are something we usually do during gym class, but in gym class at our school we move fast through any unit that we do. Having at least one extracurricular activity will give students a chance to enjoy participating in sports that they like. Also students will get to learn more about this sport and even later on join a team. There are a lot of creative students at my school. Students who want to learn about photography, drawing, and constructing things will have a great opportunity to by joining a extracurricular activity that involves this. I would like to add on that when I joined a drawing club, I learned many new things like blending colors. Additionally, training on your mindset is very important. By having a extracurricular activity like chess or board games, students will get to learn how to play board games that they have been wanting to try. Learning new things from extracurricular activities could be very helpful to students because later on they might have a chance to use this information.

Learning all day can be very hard on some students. By joining a extracurricular activity, students will be able to have a break from learning all day. Many students by the end of the day are very tired after learning for so long. By participating in an extracurricular activity students will clear their mindset. In addition to this, having a break from learning can make students feel more relieved and they will pay more attention during class. If students decide to join extracurricular activities like drawing, they will be able to calm down. It has been a proven fact that drawing will make you calm down, so by doing a extracurricular activity, students will be at ease and contribute more during class. Learning all day is very stressful and takes a lot of energy, so therefore students should participate in calm and relaxing extracurricular activities that will give them a break from school and at the same time help them pay more attention toward school.

Socializing is something that some shy students struggle with. Extracurricular activities give students a chance to make more friends and socialize. As a shy person, when I first came to my school I was struggling to find some good friends that I could trust. Later on I decided to join a chess club and a drawing club and I made great friends. Joining a extracurricular activity can give shy students a way to to train on socializing, meaning that they could practice how to socialize and even overcome their fear of socializing by talking to people in their extracurricular activity. At school, some students who are not shy can be very loud and disruptive during class. If these students join a extracurricular activity, they will not want to socialize as much during class because they will have a extracurricular activity that they could join and talk and share their opinions there. Extracurricular activities are very helpful towards students who want to make some friends and socialize, so therefore making students participate in at least one is necessary.

Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is very helpful for them. Students get to learn many new things and this might even help them chose their future career. Learning new things can be very tiring to some students and they might not even be able to handle so much information, so by joining a extracurricular activity students will get to have a break from school. To add on, students will will have the chance to socialize and make more friends. Learning can be very difficult for some students, but by participating in at least one extracurricular activity, students will be able to enjoy learning new things, get a break from learning all day, and will get to socialize and make more friends. Therefore students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because this activity will help them with their school life and their grades.

B316580FC02E,"My Principal has decided that every student must do an extracirricular activity in school. Most people disagree with this statement but I think otherwise. I agree with my principal because it can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.

There are many students that sit inside, and dont go outside as much as the are supposed to. I believe if our students are doing an extracirricular activity, it can be a great opportunity for them to make new friends and be more social. there are some students that struggle to find the courage to get up and find new friends, but if we have students doing sports, or as little as working on the yearbook once a week, it could have a big impact on those students social lives.

another good reason to have everyone do an extracirricular activity at school is it is very healthy for your mental and physical health. . All the exercise in fooball is physical, working your legs and arms to burn off fat and build muscle. But you can also improve your confidence and determination.

Finally we have extracirricular activities acting as a great outlet for kids who have family problems and/or are bullied. Most kids who have big problems dont like to open up about them because they feel like they'll be judged or made fun of, but if they are on an engaging sports team, or are working on the yearbook they could have someone to speak with that they trust, or just something to get their mind off of their personal problems.

I hope this helped you get another perspective on how extracirricular activities could help our school. it can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
692AE96B2A25,"Have you ever wondered how active you are or how active you could be? Many students have hidden skills, but do not want to use them due to their laziness or lack of interest. If many students are lazy, it could heavily impact their future in a negative way or make them miss out on something that could be extraordinary. If the principal were to add a mandatory extracurricular activity, it would come with a lot of pros that can help them in the future. I believe that extracurricular activities would be beneficial because of its way to build stronger relationships with your peers, train your body to be in good shape, and could increase hidden skills that can attract people who will reward you with money, prizes and a lot of opprutunites.

Students around the world are consumed by loneliness or boredom, but that could change with extracurricular activities. If students were to take extracurricular activities, they could be making amazing relationships that could change their lives. For example, a student could be playing basketball and make strategies with his/her peers to win the game. This could help with your listening skills, as well as athletic abilities which are key components to build good bonds with the people around you. But while your playing with your friends, you are also exercising your body to participate in these activities.

Health is a key part to your life and you would be damaging your health if you just sit around, eating junk food, and watching TV. If you decide to take an activity where movement is involved, you will be able to incorporate a lot of exercise in your day. While you move, you are also exercising and losing calories. This could help you lose body fat, encourage you to do more activities to stay fit, or help you focus in school or your activity. Staying in good shape will open so many opprutunites for you to improve or succeed. If you get skilled enough with extracurricular activities, people could reward you with items or opportunities that could change your life for the better.

Skills are a key component to become successful at school, your home or an extracurricular activity that you are taking. If you get skilled enough, people who notice you will be able to help you or reward you for the skill that you are good at. People like coaches, famous artists or singers could recruit you to an activity that could change your life. A student could be making a painting that is as good as the Mona Lisa, or a student could be so skilled that he could compete with famous basketball players like Lebron James or Kyrie Irving. This could all happen if a student were to take a extracurricular activity and put time into their activity.

In conclusion, mandatory extracurricular activities would be beneficial due to all of its opprutunites that it can offer. You could be the popular kid at school with all your new friends, be in good shape so that you can limit your chances of any health problems, or get recruited by people with amazing skills so that they can change your life for the better. Some students are not as motivated as they use to be. All they want to do is stare at their phones for excess hours or look for the best way to cause drama. Unless these students do extracurricular activities, they wont be a significant change and that is why it should be mandatory. They could miss out on something special, or never find their hidden talent. Extracurricular activities could change your life in many ways that you thought were impossible. If you put time into your activity, you never know what could happen, maybe you could be the next legend of your decade, or even century.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
DEB61D33E804,"Should students really be forced to commit to an extracurricular activity for school? Many children are already committed to activities outside of school. School is very important, but students have lives outside of the school environment. When you commit to something you should put your best effort in to it, but if you are occupied with other things it is very hard to give it your all. The principal should not implement this rule because kids are given homework, they are committed to other activities outside of school, and spending time with your family is essential.

Most children receive homework from teachers, and there is no doubt about that. Homework is important to better an understanding of a topic that is taught at school, but it can get very stressful at times. Most children spend sleepless nights trying to complete homework for the amount of classes they have. Children usually have an activity outside of school so adding that to the mix with all the homework can be hectic. It is way to much pressure to try to get good grades when there is so much to handle and you also have to remember the fact that we are kids that are still growing up.

Students are committed to other activities, teams, and programs outside of school. Would they have to quit doing that activity because they are just to stressed to handle it all? Schedules would not only shift for students but for the parents of those students. Aren't we supposed to get eight hours of sleep every night, but then how do us students do that when there is to much pressure placed on us? Teachers expect us to focus on the material they teach us at school, but that is going to be very difficult and I don't think teachers want to teach kids who don't want to be taught.

Spending time with family is so important. We spend most of our days at school and doing other activities that it's nice to take a break. I mean if we have so many activities then that's taking away family time. I love my family and I know most kids do too, so I would like to spend as much time as I can with them. This is just one of the negative effects of having to do an extracurricular activity.

Although, doing an activity is good I don't think that students should be forced to do one. It should ultimately be their choice because it can come with some negative effects. Homework, other activities, and spending time with your loved ones can be effected. The principal's rule is something I would not be here for, or would not think is the best call to make. All the stress that can come from the rule could be horrible and essentially effect the performance that students do at school.            ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
6C0442426DD3,"I do agree with the principles decision on making every student take an extracurricular activity. Beacuse students should learn to do more things than just learn english or math or any subject like that, since it could help them be more active during school, it will also give them more opportunities after they finish school. Some students may not be as smart as others when it comes to learning in school but, that should not mean that they should not have as much of an opportunity to be as successful as others could be, so giving them a chance to see something that you might really be good at or just enjoy is great.

One extracurricular activity is playing a sport like soccer, football, basketball, or track. Students need to be as successful as possible when it comes to giving them the future some students can only depend on playing sports to be successful in life. Giving them the ability to play sports in school is an amazing decision beacuse it could have a lot more benifts then people excpect, some students are naturally born with a talent for basketball or football, or even drawing so making them choose an extracurricular activity, could have them discover something they never knew they could do.

Many students do not have anything to do once they finish there school work, they may not have the money to buy a computer to play on or an xbox. By having them do an extracurricular activity like chess or something you are giving them the abilty to see other things they can do when they are bored. If a student took chess club as an extracurricular activity it could make them see how fun the game really is and have them convince there parents to buy them the chess game as a cheeper expense to keep them busy when they have nothing to do. I realize that some students may have disablititys that stop them from doing certain extracurricular activitys and thats why there are mulitiple activitys that you can do instead of doing just sports. Such as chess club, you can work on the yearbook, or you can serve as a student council.

That is why having every student take an extracurricular activty is benifical to the student. It can really help them learn to be more responsible, and open there train of thought which is always good for a student, or even just give them something to do when they are bored.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I disagree with evere student having to take an extra curricular activity because I have to take care 4 cats, take care of my mom, and collect my little sister from school.

First, I have to take care of my cats. When I get home I have to clean their litter boxes and get them fresh food and water. I have to be home becuase if I am not 2 of my newer cats will attack my older cat. I also have to play with them and their toys so they loose energy. I do this so that my mom and dad can sleep.

A33BE60AE3E7,"Sports and extracurricular activities are very common in today's schools, yet in recent years the number of students who participate in these has diminished. One of the few top causes are, technology, lack of drive, and higher levels of stress. Therefore I feel, that students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity to, aid in finding peers with similar interest, be stress beneficial, and drive students with the enticement of competition.

First and foremost, this will aid in finding peers with similar interest because, we are more often than not, on social media or are on our phones more intrigued in what somebody else is doing, or where they are going than what we are doing with their own lives. A prime example of this, is that people won't sign up for something they don't like. So people in chess club most likely want to be there, that is something everyone there has in common. Plus if we participate in multiple clubs or activities and the same people are in them to, they probably have similar interest that could lead to companionship. With this added benefit of friendship it opens a whole new door of opportunities for us. It means that we can have someone there for support or someone to go hangout with in the future. It can also drive us to take more risk in our life and open us to new opportunities like a new food or activity that we may enjoy.

Secondly, a lot of students, especially in late middle to high school, are under a exponential amount of stress. This can cause them to do are think about harmful or life threatening activities to them or others. To prevent this, it would be wise for us to be in a place where we can express ourselves and let off some steam. Extracurricular activities fulfill this need for relief in our lives, and A few of the ways it does this is exposure to the community by, travel, community service, or self influence in the community. Another benefit is time management, many students, my self included, struggle with time management because we are constantly over run by massive a amount of knowledge from the day or week, so that leads us to give to much or little time to self benefit. This leads to higher levels of stress when we don't have time to do anything on the spot. I have first hand experience with this where just the other day I came home after a long and dreadful day where I was to tired to do anything so I simply fell asleep even though I had plans to go with my friends that evening, but was famished of energy from school.

Lastly, it opens up a window of opportunity when it comes to competition. As human beings we strive to be the best in life. We want to have, the style, the smarts, and the popularity in life. With that said, clubs and sports allow for that through competition. For some they get to express their leadership skills, for others they get to home in on their teamwork skills and on the very rare occasion it teaches some to be humble with loss. Competition gives a sense of unity with each other because everyone is working toward the same goal, winning, and it can also build confidence though leadership. A good example is a sport coach, in some sports one of the players is actually the coach, and having that job is often a way to build confidence because it gives a sense of power to them. Even losing can help them, for some they feel that winning is the only thing in life so they get all worked up about it. So when they lose and understand that its not a bad thing. It helps them learn not to be so stressed about winning, and I used to be that way, but because I learned that I can lose and it won't kill me, I have enjoyed life more.

In conclusion, I feel that having us participate in a extracurricular activity is a highly beneficial idea that will allow for us to enjoy life with a higher acceptance. It will let us make more friends with similar interest, allow for us to be less stressed in life, and give us a higher sense of confidence in life. All of this leads to the fact of enjoying life to the fullest and sharing that with others instead of being secluded and stressed in life which is where a lot of the student population is right now in comparison to a couple of decades ago.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
CC8C5C963660,"A study found that 87% of students that participate in extracurricular activities become more involved at school. Extracurricular activities are fun you once you let yourself try something new. Most kids judge something before trying it, but if they try it might be worth it. Most people that do extracurricular have a more happier time in school because of its positive effects. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, become more productive, and finding a passion for something new.

One reason, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you can make new friends. When I was kindergarten there was a healthy kids club and I was a shy kid at the time. So my parents thought it would be the best for me to join the club. I was very against but still went to the club. My neighbor joined the club too so we could be together at least. When my neighbor and I came to the first healthy kids club meeting, and we were separated into different groups. A teacher called my name to leave the room with a bunch of kids in my grade that I didn't know. After we got into the room people started talking and making new friends. This one girl named Generic_Name came up to me and we started talking. After becoming friends with her, the club wasn't that bad. Generic_Name and I started to sit by each other at lunch, and played together at recesses. We are still friends together to this very day. Another example is when my neighbor started to learn baseball. As he grew up no one else in the neighborhood knew how to play baseball. He always wished he had someone to play with. Once he got into middle school he heard they were having tryouts for the baseball team. So he decided to try out for the baseball team. He made the team. He started having more friends come over to his house. He even made friends in higher grades then him. He would always being playing baseball or out having fun with his new friends. I could tell he became a more happier person, and that he has now found people he can relate to and overall have fun with too. So this is why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can make new friends.

Furthermore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. My cousin she decided to join volleyball team her freshman year. She thought it would be fun to join. She started to focus too much on volleyball. Her grades started slipping and she was told she couldn't play any volleyball games till her grades were up. She had to stay up late nights to complete extra work that would raise her grades. She thought to herself, if she went back to the volleyball team she would have to find a balance to make sure volleyball doesn't take over her whole life. She got her grades back on track and she was allowed to play in games again. She started getting used to her new schedule to balance volleyball, and school. My next example is when my uncle was in high school, he joined an after school club for mechanics. My uncle wasn't a very good child growing up. He was always skipping classes, and never show up to class. Soon he joined a mechanics club with his friends. He instantly fell in love with it. He started showing up for school, and teachers started to see him be more productive. He so after choose his job as a mechanic, and he started to save money to have his own mechanic shop. He soon went to college to learn more about mechanics. He started working in a mechanic shop to learn the experiences of working and owning a shop. He then started his own successful company. Without extracurricular to change his attitude about school, he wouldn't be where he is today. These are a few reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive.

Therefore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. When I first joined band I didn't know what instrument I would be playing. I started to play the saxophone and became good at it. Once I started to show my teacher, he offered to put me in honor band and that I would need to stay after school to join it. I started to get new songs for honor band that challenged me. I knew when I grew up I wanted to play saxophone. I'm in middle school and I couldn't get into band this year due to my honor classes. This year I have missed playing the saxophone because its my passion. I have decided next year to do less honor classes to see if I can get back into band and get to do my passion again. My second example is about my closest cousin. She joined her after school baking classes. She started baking cakes for family events and special occasions. She finally found out when she was older she wanted to become a baker. She is now working in at a bakery nearby my house. She is always baking and learning new techniques to improve her baking skills. This year she will be graduating high school early and going to culinary school. She never knew what her passion was going to be and without extracurricular she would have never known. These are my reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new.

Students making new friends, people become more productive, and find a passion for something new are reasons why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Without trying extracurricular people might never know the importance of trying something new. Overall this is why I believe extracurricular can change your life.            ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
116209F5E812,"I agree that students should participate in a Extracurricular activities. They can help kids in many ways,like if your kid wanted to get in a new sport,but didnt want to join without knowing of how the sport works. Say if you wanted your kid to be more social but he or she is to scared to talk to kids on his or her

Owen extracurricular activities can help your kid a lot. Now many kids want to be something one day, and how are you going to achieve that, by learning it of course.

Extracurricular activities are one of many ways that can help. If you need help studying,or need help with math these are a few things that Extracurricular activities can help you with.

2A2CDE97B76F,"""Particapating in an extracurricular activities is required in this school."" I disagree with the decison that every student must participate in one extracurricular activity. First of all, students may not have time to participate in extracurricular activities. Second, the student may not find an interest in any activities provided by the school. Lastly, some students may struggle with their grades. In conlcusion, students might not have the time, not have any interest in any activity, and having low grades are all reasons that extracurricular activities shouldn't be required.

First of all, students may not have time to participate in extracurricular activities. For example, a student may have to stay after school for extra help with assignments. Or, the student does alot participating with their religion. The student may find it hard to balance their activities through the day. All together, fitting all their day to day activities in one day could be hard for a student.

Second, the student may not find an interest in any activities provided by the school. Every student has different interest. One student may like sports, another music, or maybe even working on the yearbook. There could be students though that don't find interest in any of those activities. So, students shouldn't be forced to participate in any activilty they don't enjoy.

Lastly, some students may struggle with their grades. Some students may find it hard to keep their grade up. Alot of the time, the coach or teacher won't let students participate with low grades. The students low grades could get them kicked off their team or anything they are participating in. All in all, students grades could affect their participation.

I don't think students should be forced to particpate in any extracurricular activity. Not having time in the day, not having any interest in any of the activities provided, and having low grades are all reasons students shouldn't have to participate in extra activities.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
D20068BDE3F8,"If a principle were to make all kids participate in at least one extracurricular activity, what would kids and parents think? It could quite possibly go either way, a hit or a miss.

Most of the kids that go to school are antisocial, and what most extracurricular activities are about is communicating, for example, running a play in football, calling for the ball in basketball, talking to other kids in the student council. And that's most definitely not fair to the kids who are not very sociable. Besides, you also have to try out for sports, so if you happened to not make the team, your stuck with something you don't like.

Although some students may not be sociable, this rule could open some new doors for them, finding a new passion, or something they do in a extracurricular activities might just be their job when they get older.

Parents may also get very involved as well, everybody knows that if a parent sees their child unhappy, they'll do everything in there power to stop or put and end to it. And I personally don't think that schools want a swarm of angry parents trying to change some tiny rule.

Because no matter where you go, visit, or travel everybody's different! The world is a very diverse and unique place, full of humans with all sorts of different opinions and views. So you shouldn't force rules that make people unhappy. extracurricular activities should be a fun, option you can choose, not something you must follow.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
37B2B196F7C5,"A lot of kids enjoy extracurricular activity,I argree with the decision because some kids might like to be in extra stuff to become a better student and for themselves. Kids need extracurricular activity, A lot of kids brains are not all the way devolved yet so there for they can't think like an adult. Most kids play sports and things and some kids just sit and play games and watch TV all day long. Think about if they see what the good kids are doing and see them doing extra work they might follow behind the bigger person and get their work done. The principal is right for extracurricular activity so we can become better and would get out and do more stuff.

Some kids think when they hear the word extra thats its going to be a lot of work when it might not be and they are to lazy to get up and do something,plus to try and put in work. Some kids need the work to become a better child instead of getting older and not knowing what to do. When you get use to being a lazy child it goes into you adult hood and you become more and more lazier and don't want to go and get a job to be able to feed yourself. You might have a family thats hungry and you might need to go out and do a extra thing to get food. The person will remember,when you was in school and didn't want to do the extra activity and it will mass with your mind.

A child would probably think the same way, but sometimes you might need to handle yo business even if you dont want to do it. extracurricular activity doesnt have to be work it could be anything like,camps,helping the homeless,donating money. Some people might need to get use to extra stuff cause when the kids get older they are going to want to be able to be smart and be able to read. sometimes you never know what can help with your life so gotta make it count. Some kids might think it's dumb but i think its good to be on a higher level you could even get a good grade for it.

To be a kid at this school its a good school,Im pretty sure that the principal wants the kids to be great coming into a huge world, so to be able to do that we will have to take reasobilty. I want extracurricular activity because you can learn a lot of stuff in a little period of time. When its extra work or an activity take it cause in the long run you wont regret it. Its the first time the principal has wanted this for the school and its property for a reason,If you not good with decisions this should be a good one. Sometimes you can tell your best friend to make u want to do it so they can with you. a lot of people went on their own like me i decided to go and i was not even bad.

63F12BD57AE7,"Have you ever come home from school and been bored, because you have nothing to do? Fortunately enough for you, there are tons of extracurricular activities available. I believe that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The first reason I believe this, is that students are able to try a new activity and meet new people. In addition to that, students can learn teamwork and make friends from an extracurricular. Finally, students participating in an extracurricular learn how to balance school work on on top of their activity.

When students try new activities, they can discover things about themselves and new people with common interests. Students may discover a talent or interest in something that they never knew they had. For example, if a person has never kicked a soccer ball, then they will not know whether they're good at it or they like it. Furthermore, even if students come to find that they don't like their extracurricular, they can still use this experience in the future. Just like when a person tries a new food, if that individual doesn't like it, then they will remember. The students can then use their knowledge to avoid what they don't like in the future. Last, it is beneficial to try a new activity, because you may meet someone you don't know who has similar interests to yours. Meeting these new people with common interests can lead to new friendships, that never would have happened. Trying a new extracurricular allows students to learn more about themselves and meet new people.

Participating in group activities is very important to students. For example, teamwork can be learned by practicing and working with a team in an extracurricular. In an extracurricular it is crucial that team members trust, rely, and work with each other to achieve the common goal. Secondly, using this teamwork to collaborate and accomplish goals, can lead to new friendships. When a student learns to trust and work with a team member within a extracurricular, they can also trust and collaborate with that person outside of the extracurricular. Last but not least, being able to work in a group is a very important skill that people look for when they are hiring for jobs. Companies look for teamwork in their employees, because co-workers need to be able to collaborate and respect each other to do their jobs efficiently. Activities that schools offer teach an important lesson about teamwork, that can create new friendships and be used outside of school.

Partaking in an extracurricular and school at the same time has many benefits. The first of those being, that participating in an activity and school at the same time teaches students the manage their time. Adding an extracurricular on top of schoolwork can only be done if the student learns to use all of their time wisely. This time management allows a person to do more things they love to do. If a person can be efficient and not procrastinate on things they have to do, they will have leftover time to do whatever they want. The final reason a student should attend school and do an extracurricular, is that time management is a necessary life skill that students must learn. In the future students may need to balance a family, work, and make time for themselves all at the same time. Participating in school and an extracurricular teaches students a valuable life lesson about time management, that can allow these students to do what they love.

I think that all students in school must partake in at least one extracurricular. I think this, because students can get new experiences and meet new people, while trying a new activity. Not only that, activities students participate in can teach teamwork that can lead to new friendships. My last reason for believing this is that, taking part in school and extracurricular activities gives students a lesson about how to manage time wisely. I believe that all schools should require students to partake in an extracurricular.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
5FB0797A7BFC,"Do you wanna be successful in every aspect of your life? Well I believe that it would be a great idea to have every students participate in a extracurricular activity. Because one it would keep every student focused on something positive. Second it could help them get into college or get a good job. Not to mention it could give them learning experiences and keep them out of trouble.

One reason I believe that it would be a good idea is because it would keep students focused on something. For example if a kid decides to try out a sport they could fall in love with it so they work hard at it. So not only could they put that work ethic in the sport they could also put it in the classroom. This can also ready students for the work world when you have to be motivated to do stuff.

Another benefit of every kid doing a extra activity is that it could help get them into a college. Like if you do volunteering at an old folks home that could help out a lot. Or if you did something like charity work. playing sports can also help you get into a good college. Not only could that help with getting in college but also help you get a job, etc.

Also if you do activities it can help you stay out of trouble. Especially if your a kid that does get in trouble a lot this can help you eliminate bad influences , distractions, etc. it can also give you good learning experiences. So if you have an activity going on it will help you greatly with staying out of trouble.

To conclude I think extra curricular activities would be very positive for students. It could help your work ethic. It can help you focus your time and every in to something positive. Help you with getting into college or a job. It can also help you stay out of trouble.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
2CFBD4AA7BE5,"What do you like to do after school? The answer is probably go home and relax. But wouldn't it be great if everyone did an extracurricular activity. Their is so much fun and exciting things to do other than just go home and relax for the rest of the day. I think kids should have to do extracurricular activities because you make new friends, you help out your school, and it creates other opportunities.

While doing extracurricular activities you can make new friends. Making new friends is bound to happen while doing extracurricular activities, you and another person are just going to click and get along with each other very well. Making friends with the people that do the same extracurricular as you can have a lot of benefits. Take this for example; I play football and my friend Generic_name doesn't. So when I try telling Generic_name about the struggles that I am going through on the football team or something important about the team, he can't help me with my problem because he is not involved. But, if I have a friend on the team then he can help me with my problems and I can also help with his or her problems. Overall, extracurricular activities help make friends that can help you through things.

Some extracurricular activities help out the school and the community a lot. It may be in a small way but it still helps. Groups that make the yearbook or students that serve on the student council are helping the school out. They are helping to keep the school in order and to keep students happy. Other extracurricular activities like football and basketball help their school and community by winning games this helps the school make money, it helps the community by providing entertainment. Some schools even have environmental clubs that help the school, the community, and even the world. All in all, extracurricular activities help the school and community.

Most importantly extra curricular activities create more opportunities. When doing extracurricular activities you might find out that you are really good at something. People that are good at sports often get scholarships to play sports in college. You might write a school news paper and find out that you are a really good writer and could possibly become a writer or find another job that involves writing. Also doing these extracurricular activities will go on your resume and help you get into college. Extracurricular activities create so many opportunities it is outstanding.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities have a lot of benefits. They can help you make friends, help your school and community, and create new opportunities. People may not want to do extracurricular activities but it will help you out later on in life and you will have plenty of fun. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
5093B51E7CBE,"I joined a extracurricular activity and made a lot of friends in the process, 1 of my best friends is actually someone i met during a extracurricular activity, his name is Generic_Name and we met through football. I agree with having students being in a extracurricular activity because you make more friends, become more social with better communication skills, and you might find a activity that you like to do.

One of the reasons why I think it's good for people to have more friends is so you dont have to deal with loneliness. Being lonely is something that no one wants to go through. You might have a great personality or a really cool talent, but no one is willing try and get to know you. Nobody wants to sit at the lunch table by themselves, or have a class with no friends in it either. And also people want to be known as the ""cool kid"" or something of that nature, which isn't a bad idea. But if you make friends with people who act just like you then that'll be a lot better than hanging out with the cool kids.

Another reason on why its good to have friends is so school isn't as boring. Walking around in the halls by yourself, sitting in a class with no friends, or jogging in P.E. by yourself is boring. If you have friends then he or she will invite you out to do stuff, so it also makes life at home more fun.

my last reason on why it is good to have friends is because a good friend can make your day a lot better. If your team just lost the championship and your sad then hanging out with your best friend might not be a bad idea. Or if something is bothering you then a friend can tell when something is wrong with you,and he or she will try to make you feel better or if they have to leave you alone then they will. A good friend should want the best for you,they should make you feel happy. However, if a friend is always putting you down, making you sad, or can't make you feel good about yourself, then that person isn't a good friend.

Some of the reasons why i think having good communication skills and being more social is good is so making new friends isn't hard for you. If you have bad communication skills then making new friends might not be easy for you. And since your not that good you might not even try to make new friends because you might not even try to make new friends because you probably think that you might come off as weird, and you wont get that person to be your friend. But if you participate in a after school activity then your social skills will grow, and you will also know how to talk to different kinds of people.

Lastly, i think its good to be social and good at communicating in the real world. In the real world you will most likely be working with someone else. If your a doctor, do sports, or something along the lines of working with other people, then having good communication skills would make your job easier. If you have bad communication then your job will be harder and you might not like it as much because of the people you work with.

My final reason on why i think students should participate in a after school activity is because if they find something they like to do. If a student is does a sport like basketball and he or she likes it, then that person might want to play basketball something around that topic. Maybe they dont want to be a basketball player but instead a coach or a physical trainer. Or maybe they just want to be in shape so that their body can do a physical activity at its full potential.

Joining a after school activity doesnt seem so bad, i think theirs a lot more benefits if you do it than if you dont. Meeting new people,making new friends, being more social, and communicating better with others seems like you have a lot to gain.

My reasons for why the school should put kids in a extracurricular activity are making new friends,have better social and communication skills, and they might find a activity that they like, i agree that the principal should enforce this rule and i hope i could convince other people to support my opinion.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
53E982E9957C,"The principal wants to make everyone join in an extracurricular activity and i don't agree. I thank that the students should chose if they want to join or not join a extracurricular activity. If they dont want to that's up to them. If they did not wont to join then the students might not do anything in the activity expressly if they are doing it agents there own will. I know i would if i was forced agents my will.

If you did not want to do something would you do it if you whir not asked or told to do it? Because if not why would you do it if you are told to? If you hate football would you play it? I know i would not.

Like i said before the students should be able to chose if they want to join or not. If they do want to join then good for them, but if they dont then leave them alone. Some of them might not have the time or the transportation. Some of them might focus on their grades instead of games, and the student needs to have good grades so it would be a waste of time for some of them.

Maybe they just like any sport, or they dont like to art. Maybe they dont want to be on the student council because they thank it's to much responsibility. Maybe they don't know how to use a camera for the year book. Maybe they find know interest in any extracurricular activity.

9A3938C8593B,"Have you ever been forced to do something that you did not want to do? Like a sport or some type of activity? Well the principal has decided that now on you have to be taking an extracurricular activity and I think that idea is terrible and disagree with his decision and here are my three main reasons. First what if the students parents can not help there kid with anything involving the activity. Secondly, the students may not have enough time for the activity. Thirdly, students may not like any of the activities.

First lets talk about how parents can't get involved/or help with the activity at all. Like what if the activity fee is to much and the students parents can not afford it. Or there parents could be working later than usual and there not able to pick you up from the activity because there to busy with work. Also what if your parents are at home watching other siblings how are they gonna drop/pick you up. Or even what if they stayed home sick and there not feeling good who's going to pick them up or drop them off. And what if there exhausted from a big day of work and don't feel like getting up or moving because there to tired. Finally what if there injured and can't get out of bed then who's gonna pick or drop of the kids because they obviously can't.

Next lets talk about students not having enough time for the activity because they have stuff to do. Like they have a lot of HW they have to do or catch up on. Or there going to another siblings activity because they can't stay home alone. Also they may have to stay home and watch younger siblings because they can't be left home alone without someone. Or even what if they planned with a couple of friends to hangout that day and go do something fun. And what if there parents have a lot of chores planned for them and there not able to finish because they have to go to the activity. Finally what if they do other activities outside of school like a sport or a club.

Finally lets talk about how the students may not like any of the activities the school has and what it could cause. Like the students could get mad that there being forced to do something they do not wanna do. Or they could develop a bad relationship with there parents because they feel like there parents are forcing them to do it. Also they might get so bored they will just end up skipping the activity instead of going to it. Or even there behavior could change in a bad way making them mean, naughty, and disrespectful. And they could start developing depression because there being forced to do something they do not want to do which can build up depression/anger/sadness. Finally they could get really bored of the activity and keep misbehaving.

This is why forcing kids to do something they don't want to do/or can't do is bad. Because it can lead up to a lot of bad things in a students life and a very few good things. So I think these activities should be optional so you do not have to deal with your parents not being able to help you with anything involving the activity, or not having enough time to do the activity, and not having any activities you like. So if they were optional it would create not as much stress on the students and parents so not everyone is freaking out.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
FB81CD2A82AD,"Our beloved principal has decided that students attending this excellent school must be a member of a least one extracurricular activity, and I am in complete support of this idea. The benefits of this proposal are exquisite and will not only help students, but parents as well. Some students may think staying after school would be an annoyance, but there is something for everyone after the last bell. Whether students join a football team or a math club, many children will have a bright smiles on their faces when they're participating in an activity of their choice. All students should be required to participate in a minimum of one extracurricular activity because it will enhance the minds and muscles of students, teach students to be active citizens, and assist working parents.

To begin with, executing this decision will strengthen the minds of many students. Fun clubs like the Drama Club and Art Club promote out of the box thinking and creativity. A vast majority of students would benefit from these teachings because they work a part of a student's brain that isn't always challenged throughout the school day. Also, clubs are great way to introduce new career paths to children. For example, the Robotics Team introduces students to the growing world of STEM. Practicing STEM from a young age, especially in an after school club, is a spectacular way to increase the number of future engineers, mathematicians, and scientists, which would heavily benefit our technology advancing planet.

In addition to clubs, students would also have more opportunity to join sports teams. Some parents cannot afford to pay for a recreational or travel sports team, so this required extracurricular activity could help a number of less fortunate students participate in a sport of their choice. This requirement could also promote health benefits for students. With an extracurricular activity as requirement, some students who usually don't exercise may join a sports team, leading to an overall healthier school. Furthermore, with more students participating in school sports, there will most likely be more supporters at games. This could result in more school spirit and in total a more enthusiastic student body.

Also, requiring students to participate in after school activities could teach majority of our students to become good, active citizens. Good citizens participate in local government. This new requirement teaches students to participate in extracurricular activities, consequently many of them will form a positive habit of being active in their communities. Children form habits and learn many critical skills in their grade school years, so teaching them to start participating now could greatly impact the future of community activity. To elaborate, some students may join student council. Student council is superb preparation for future government jobs students might hold. Therefore, requiring students to become members of at least one extracurricular activity could lead to a better society with more active citizens.

Lastly, this decision could assist hard working parents. Most parents work 9:00am to 5:00pm, and if their children are at school for an additional hour for an extracurricular activity, they would have the luxury of being able to get all of their work done, and pick up their children from school on time. Mothers and fathers of many students work extremely hard to provide for their families. With an extra hour to spare on a day their children stay after school, parents could potentially have a more zen car ride, free from worry of being late to the car pick up line. As a result of having additional time to get to the school building, parents may drive slower. This could lead to safer roads with fewer accidents.

To conclude, the principal's decision to require students to participate in one extracurricular activity is beneficial to the student body and their parents. The decision helpful because it will introduce new ways of learning to many students, promote exercise and school spirit, teach students to participate in their communities, and help working mothers and fathers. This idea could also make the roads safer. As a student, member of many clubs, and a car rider, I believe this decision will make our school better for students, and make our school unique from others. Requiring students to participate in a minimum of one after school activity was a great decision made by our principal and should be supported by all of the amazing students that make out school special.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
0C9C3B277852,"Imagine, if you will, a world full of students with smart minds and massive strength. It would be the start of something beautiful. I love this plan, the thought of having every kid doing either a sport or a club they like could really help them and the whole school a lot more than just the kids that do it now. I agree with the Principal because participating in extracurricular activities would help the students get to know their peers, it would give the school an extra source of income, and finally, make the students physically and mentally stronger.

Having kids do extracurricular activities would help them to get to know their peers. When kids do something with one another, they get the feeling of camaraderie and friendship that usually comes with being on any sort of team, It builds a tremendous amount of trust. Furthermore, when students come home, they might not have any way to reach their friends, the after-school activities would help them stay connected to their friends. Finally, when students do anything, and win, they are given a sense of accomplishment, a sense like they could do anything in the entire world.

Putting all the kids into extracurricular activities would generate an alternative source of income for the School. We all know that our schools are sometimes overcrowded and underfunded if we helped out by just pitching in a small fee for every child to join an after-school team or club, it would help the school have some sort of spending money so that they could get new things. Just by giving the school that small fee, we could help the kids by creating new opportunities for them, like getting them free college tours, or giving them new laptops that would allow them to make researching easier to get into better schools. And lastly, those fees would help pay the teachers salary, they are overworked and underpaid enough as it is.

Giving the students the opportunity to go into after-school activities would make them stronger both physically and mentally. If students join a sports team like Football or Hockey, it would make them stronger because it builds muscle and gives them purpose. Furthermore, When you look into the science behind why after-school activities are so important you would see that they make kids do better in school and at home, their entire work ethic is changed for the better. When students are both physically and mentally fit, they no longer have that craving for freedom, because they have found it in their teams, they no longer make the terrible choices that lead to them doing drugs, alcohol, or breaking laws because their freedoms are there for them.

When students are placed into extracurricular activities, they have more trust in their peers, they generate a new source of income for the School, and it makes the students physically and mentally fit. when we give the next generation the tools of success, we are making the world better. The science cannot lie, when placed in these situations with their peers, they come out stronger together, like a family. So, the next time that a school has a mandatory extracurricular activity to graduate, do it. Give the kids the tools to express themselves and control their own destiny. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Extracurricular activities can create new friendships and expose you to new friend groups. If you struggle to find friends in your normal school day then extracurricular activities can help! Most of my friends today were formed through extracurricular activities. You may be loosing the opportunity for so many new friends by not participating in these activities. There is a whole world of fellow students waiting to meet you, these activities will expose you to them.

Many of these activities will improve your education while having fun. Math club and Science Olympiad are great examples of this. These activities are less stressful than regular classes, but can help you to fully understand your topics. Virginia Readers Choice was a activity that most elementary schools participated in. V.R.C. helped my reading speed and comprehension, but was fun at the same time. To this day I still go back to read V.R.C. books. Extracurricular activities can improve your learning experience forever.

Some extracurricular activities can boost your physical and mental health. By participating in these you will always come home happier and healthier. Most sports will teach you important life skills and qualities while getting you in great shape. Football taught me perseverance, responsibility, cooperation, and courage. These qualities will be with me for the rest of my life. Extracurricular activities will improve your life in many ways.

Students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities to improve their education and life. These activities include sports, education clubs, and social clubs. Extracurricular activities can create new friendships, improve your education, and improve your mental and physical health.    ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
0E5278E12B82,"Do you want more stress and pressure from your schoolwork and extracurricular activity? Do you want your time with your family and friends cut short? In today's world, students usually gets too much pressure from their extracurricular activities causing them to forget about their grades and schoolwork. Students shouldn't have to do an extracurricular activity in school because it adds more stress to their academic and social life and it cuts the time they can us to spend their time with their family and friends.

In addition to that, a reason why students shouldn't be pressured into doing an extracurricular activity is because it adds more stress into their academic and social life. For example, if a student joined a sport or a musical group, students that chose a sport would put their focus in practice since the championship games may be coming up. And students that chose a musical or art activity would also put their focus in their practice time to make sure to top first in their competitions. And all the students would put their focus into their practice time to hold up the school's pride. Meanwhile, their grades may be dropping because the students aren't focused on their grades since their extracurricular activity is keeping them focus on the game or competition. Making students' school work and extracurricular activity hard to balance.

Furthermore, another reason why students' shouldn't have the need to take an extracurricular activity is because it could cut the time they spend with their family and friends short. For example, students that chose a musical or sport as an extracurricular activity would have to do practice after school to focus on the game or competition, and sometimes practice can be held back late since the coaches or teachers want to make sure that the students are focused to hold up the school's pride. And with that, the time the students spend with their friends and family would cut short because of the need to focus on his/her extracurricular activity.

In conclusion, making students do an extracurricular activity would add more stress and pressure on to the student making their schoolwork hard to balance, and it cuts time off the time they spend with their family and friends. Extracurricular activities can make students' schoolwork and social life hard to balance because of their focus not being on schoolwork or social life, but on his/her extracurricular activity. Do really want to have no choice but to join an extracurricular activity? And making students have no choice but to do an extracurricular activity can really impact their school life and social life. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
DF0E5C97D467,"Imagine being in a club, the kids in it share the same interests as you. You feel at home in this club, and you can talk to your peers if you have any trouble. Making extracurricular activities, like clubs and sports, mandatory will give students opportunities to enjoy this feeling and much more. They will give kids new experiences, and help them with their social lives, I know that these are true because I joined a club once and experienced all of these things!

When kids join activities, they gain new experiences that they had never had before. Firstly, they could discover hobbies, and find out that they really like something that they would have never thought to try before. There is a saying, ""You never know until you try"", and some kids need to hear this saying. They might never try to join a club unless it is mandatory, but when they do, they might find something that they really enjoy hiding in one of those activities. Also, if they already enjoy one an activity, as in sports, art, music, and others, then they can get more experience in that field. If a child really enjoys drawing, painting, and being creative, but they don't really seem to have time to practice that, they could join an art club and become better at what they enjoy. Additionally, making mandatory activities will get some kids to do something other than laze around at home. In my case, and many of my friends' as well, I have nothing to do outside of school and get bored really fast. Having a mandatory extracurricular activity will help me get outside the house and do more. For these reasons, students would get so many new, life changing experiences from mandatory extracurricular activities.

Students' social lives could change for the better because of this new rule. Children will make new friends during these activities. Joining clubs and teams will introduce kids to new peers, and they might even be potential friends. Moreover, making students join an activity will help them in the long run. A lot of clubs will require students to have good grades, volunteer, and more. This will be better for when children are applying for colleges and even jobs when they are older. Lastly, students will grow closer with their old friends. If students join clubs that their friends join, they can spend more time with them than they usually do. I only have half of a block with one of my closest friends, and none with the other. Joining a club together will give us much more time to talk and make awesome memories. In conclusion, making students join clubs and teams will improve their social lives.

In my old school, I joined the Lego club with my little sister, I didn't know many people and neither did she. My knowledge of Lego was also not very vast, but none of the other clubs had seemed appealing to me and I also owned some Lego bricks at home. Prior to joining the club, my biggest, most impressive build was a multicolored box that somehow housed a small Lego girl. My sister was not anywhere as experienced than I was. In fact, she only joined because I had, and she wanted to do everything that her big sister did. The first thing we had to do in that club was to make a team and make a space themed build, and our sibling duo decided to partner up with another pair girls. We had 45 minutes, the leftover time would be for displaying the builds. When the time started, our little band of four barely talked, except for the occasional joke or two, but as time went on, we had started to open up more, and soon we couldn't build due to the amount of laughter coming out of our mouths. By the end, we had made an ugly, big, white box that a little, astronaut figurine had squished inside. A masterpiece. We couldn't even present our build due to the fits of giggles that had overcome us, but it was worth it, and my sister and I became good friends with the girls. As time went on, we got better and better at building, and I fostered a new hobby; building with Lego. As you can see, joining an extracurricular activity benefited both my sister and I, and making these activities mandatory will touch many more students.

Although some students will complain against this new rule, extracurricular activities will benefit them in ways that they do not see. Their lives will be filled with interesting new memories as they get more comfortable in their club, or sport. Many more students will have a better social life, making new friends, gaining better chances at colleges and jobs, and improving their old relationships. My time at the Lego club proved these things to be true, and I believe that making mandatory extracurricular activities will help so many students. More schools should make activities mandatory, not just ours.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
67C8EC23C79F,"Imagine having a long day of school, tests in all your classes, and feeling tired, then having to stay in school an extra couple hours because your school requires you to stay after school and participate in an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities are clubs and committees in school that you take part in before or after regular learning hours including sports clubs, yearbook committee, student council and more. They are great ways to keep students in touch with the school however, they should not be a requirement. I believe students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because students should be able to have a choice whether or not they want to come before or after school and students should not be required to stay in school longer than the required amount of hours.

Students should be able to have a choice if they want to participate in an extracurricular activity. If I am having a bad day or if I am tired from studying the night before I should be able to choose whether or not if I want to take part in an extracurricular that day. Furthermore, students should not be forced into having to participate in an extracurricular even if they are feeling fine, they should not have to stay after school if they dont want to. An extracurricular is something that the student is interested and want to take because they want to not because the school is making them.

Students should not be required to stay in school longer than the required amount of hours that are set. Students already have to be in school six to seven hours a day, five days a week, there is no reason why a student should be required to stay in school longer than they already are. When the bell rings to be dismissed, I want to go home not stay in school for more time. If you want to take part in an after or before school activity that should be your own choice to come to school early or to stay after school.

Overall, I think student should not be forced to take part in an extracurricular activity because student should be able to have a choice to take part in an extracurricular or not and students should not be required to stay in there school longer than they are required to. If a student wants to join an extracurricular activity they should but if a student does not want to the student should not have to. School days are long enough for a student especially when the student has tests they need to study for and projects that are almost due students should have to add more to his or her plate by coming before or after school if they do not want to. In the end, a student simply should not have to take part in an extracurricular activity if they do not want to.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
47F818E17801,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Do you think thats a good idea ? I think its an amazing idea. My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I think thats a great idea. Extracurricular activities are good for you because you can gain a lot from them for example if you do a sport you can get your daily exercise. Extracurricular activities give you life skills like communication, working with other people, etc, witch are good for you in the future and your present lives. A lot of extracurricular activities help you express your ideas and opinions with other people for different things.

You get your daily exercise if you do sports for your extracurricular activities. Football is a great extracurricular activity because you get your daily cardio from it. Doing football,basketball, etc helps you loss weight. Obesity is a big problem in the student body so sports for an extracurricular activity is a good idea for them. Your health gets better and body from the exercise so that can benefit you by helping you perform better in p. e and other sports you might do outside of school. Sports are a good extracurricular activity that makes daily extracurricular activities a good idea but thats not the only reason extracurricular activities are a good idea.

You get life skills from some of the activities. Working on a year book with other students gives you a life skill of working with other people. You get it by working with other people witch you do in the activity your doing. You can also get another very important skill like the communication skill. Communication skills are very important especially in the future when you might be at a job interview. Another skill you can get is patience. Patience is an important life skill you can use for a lot of things in life. You can get a lot of skills from extracurricular activities witch is another reason its a good thing to be apart of and is a good idea. What Im trying to say is that extracurricular activities are a good idea. My last reason is that you get your express your ideas and opinion with others on an activity. How ever some people might say that its a bad idea and extracurricular activities are not nesesary and are a waste of time. But if you really think about it there kind of nesesary and are definitely not a waste of time because of all the benefits you get from there. And they must be nesesary if the principal has decided that all students must participate.    ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
273A6BFCD55B,"It's always nice to have students be apart of their school. Most students love after school or in school activities, for example the football team if this school didn't have a football team students that enjoy football would be mad. Same with every other sport, schools need to have extra activities or they will not be as good as ones that do. Students might want to switch schools if they don't have activities they enjoy, because other schools might have things they enjoy, like sports and clubs.

It will also make their school look better if all students are in a extracurricular activity. It could possibly expand the choices of what students might like too. There are plenty activities to choose from and students should have to at least choose one. Even if it's from cards to basketball it doesn't matter but schools should have students doing something. Schools should have a system to where you can make your own ""club"" or activity. So then if students don't like what their school offers them then they can make a activity they enjoy.

Making students do after school activities would also bring them closer together. They could meet new people and make more friends. Also it will overall bring the school closer together. Then everybody will know each other and mostly all kids will have friends. It is important for schools to have activities or else nobody would like the school.

This is why schools should have activities because they make schools look better.

They also help students get friends and, finally they help bring everybody closer together. So this is why schools should have extracurricular activities.                          ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
958229D0AE9F,"How would you feel if your principle told you how to spend your time outside of school? When and why you should do something? Before you decide, read the essay on why students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities.

The first topic is that making students participate could make the activity less fun. It would be unfair to the people who want to participate. People who want to do the activity should not have to deal with someone who does not have a passion for the activity, and frankly, does not want to be there.

Also, the person who is being forced may not have an interest in the topic and will not benefit the team. Forcing students to do something they do not want to do could slow the entire group down. The student could be rushing to do their share of the work so the can get to do other things. Therefore, they might not do the job to the best of their abilities. This could result in the entire group having to do more work and preventing them from doing other projects.

Secondly, time management. As we all know students lives can be difficult and a pain to manage. Making time for your family is something every kid should do. However, by making kids participate in a club, they might have to start cutting out family time from their hectic schedule. In health class the teachers tell us to always make time for your family. How would we make time for our family if we have to participate in a club that takes up our free time? Next, the hardest thing to manage is school. Adding this requirement could make it harder for some students to have time to do their homework, projects, and study for their tests. Taking away the students right to choose could result in their grades and SOL scores going down. The next example is friends. Making kids participate could lead to them canceling plans with friends, and result in them losing their friends, because now their free time has been taken up doing these clubs they have no passion for.

Finally, this could make it harder to socialize. Forcing students to participate could lead to other members of the club resenting them for not doing their share of the work. Which, sadly, could end friendships before they even have a chance. Some people will say that by making them do this they will make more friends. However, friendships cannot be forced, and they have to start with something two people have in common. Next, by forcing kids to join clubs, they will not make friends because they could be the only person in the group who does not want to be there. This means they might not pursue a friendship because it started off with something they do not have in common. The last example is that this could lead to bullying. The student who does not want to be in the club could feel singled out because no one wants to talk to them because they do not have anything in common. Therefore, the student will feel bullied and singled out of the entire class.

Forcing kids to participate in these activities, is not in their best interests because it will make the activities less fun, harder to fit in their schedule, and will make it difficult to socialize. Forcing kids to participate in activities can only serve to hurt them inside and outside of school.         ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
C1EF875519DC,"A few years ago a kid named Generic_Name was the best wrestler in the county, but before wrestling started him and his friends would get in trouble with the law a lot. The town where Generic_Name grew up in had a lot of violence and drugs, and it was not a good influence on him. One day, one of Generic_Name's favorite teacher told him about a sport called ""wrestling"", when he looked into it and tried it out, he soon realized that wrestling was something he would enjoy. After practice the coach came over to Generic_Name and explained that if he wanted to stay on the team he would need to keep his grades up along with not getting in trouble. By the end of the year Generic_Name was an A,B

student and has not gotten in trouble with the law since wrestling started. Being in extracurricular activities makes you less likely to get in trouble and encourages you to keep your grades up.

My principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity like : sports, work on the yearbook or clubs. I for one completely agree with him. One reason is because when you are doing something you enjoy like a sport you want to stay on the team, and are less likely to do something to get in trouble. Another is because when you get out in the world you can meet new people and make new friends. The final reason is because when you are on a team you have to have good grades and those sports and extracurricular activities will encourage you to keep your grades up if there something you enjoy doing.

When your in those clubs or on a team your friends can help you out with problems, and it is good to know you can talk to your teammates about problems you may have. one of my best friends became a county champ this year and he didnt even want to wrestle at the beginning of the year but on the wrestling team where like a family and we helped him out with his problems and now he is a county champ.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
8945D160056D,"I agree that students should participate in extracurricular activities because, sometimes kids go home and have nothing to do and just sit around the rest of the day after coming home from school. Secondly, there is a vast number of students that dont participate in any activities at all. Doing sports and other activities could probably help some students a lot. You can hang out with friends while doing these activities which can make the activity more fun. Lastly, Everyone is always mostly on there phone so they dont do anything productive.

Most of the time when kids get home they just lay around the rest of the day. Which is very boring, and not fun at all. Doing an extracurricular activity can stop you from being bored the rest of the day. When some students are bored they eat junk food, which is not healthy at all. Thats why some parents shouldn't let there child sit around all day. This happens very often where kids gain a lot of weight just from being bored. This can lead to a lot of health problems and i dont think anyone wants that for there kid. Nobody would want to see their kid really sick

When doing these activities you can ask a friend to join you if they are not in any activities either. Asking a friend to join can probably make you enjoy the activity more. Maybe you might think the activity is boring and would be better enjoyed if a friend joined you so you can have someone to talk to. Having no one to talk to makes it boring and makes you want to quit. You can also meet new people and make new friends with the people that are also in these activities. So inviting a friend who isn't in any activities could probably help them too.

Everyone is always on their phone and they really care about these activities. Sometimes students are more worried about playing a game on there phone or TVs when they get home. Thats these are even relevant for them. Additionally, They should talk about it more often in schools so the kids will see just staying home and doi9ng nothing isn't healthy and they at least should do sports or something productive. And being in front of a screen all day can damage your eyes. I don't blame them because being on your phone is basically like an addiction. Since there is so much to do on your phone instaed of actually going outside and doing things.

In conclusion, Being in a extracurricular activity could probably help improve your grades, your social skills, and your performance in school overall. It may even help improve some people grades, because a lot of people werent really focused on this type of stuff but joining an activity may help. It can help with boredom if students have nothing to do at home. It can also give them some fresh air if students are doing sports because they are technically cramped in a classroom and get stuck in busy hallways the whole day. So i agree that joining a extracurricular activity would be a good impact on school life.          ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
5FAB26EAECD2,"Shoot the ball! Quickly! Swish that was the sound of my team winning the playoffs. Our principal decided that every student should attend at least on extracurricular activity. His decision has impacted us in a positive way. It's safe to say that I agree with his decision. An extracurricular activity can improve one's life emotionally, and physically.

One gain in attending an extracurricular activity is that it can fix a persons body weight. For instance, being in a sports team or cheer leading requires a healthy diet and working out. If you don't complete these two tasks it could have you kicked from the team. This emphasizes the fact that an extracurricular activity such as sports can improve one's health. Who doesn't want to be healthy? Being in the basketball team overweight is a tough job. Especially when the students in the team must go to practice almost everyday. When they go to practice, they improve their skills in basketball and their stamina meaning they have to run a lot, it can be for any sport. Since the person is already doing their workout in practice, all they have to do outside is eat healthy. Now thats easy! Within months this person could have lose tons of weight and maybe even started to get abs. Sports, an extracurricular activity, has already knocked down the health factor in ones life.

Social life is another factor in which an extracurricular activity touches upon. It can help someone make new friends that take interest in the same things as themself. One can join the art or the yearbook editing club and meet people that enjoy drawing, and painting as much as them. That student could potentially have found a new friend that they can share their stories or ideas with. This shows that just one extracurricular activity could bring a student one step closer to their peers. This works the same with any sport as well. Sports also have the ability to make a student connect with others. Moreover, it can help a person communicate better with the friends they already have. If one is having difficulty coming up with ideas to talk about with their friends, they can join a club or do sports. This will give each of them something to talk and discuss about. They could talk about how practice was or what they drew in the art club today. These extracurricular activities provide some people with something to talk about with their friends.

An extracurricular activity can help with teamwork, being open to other people's ideas, and sharing a student's own ideas. It can improve the way students consider other ideas coming from different people. If a student decides to serve the student council they have to think about all the others that are also a part of their team. These students have to keep in mind that students around the school might give suggestions on what one should improve. This means that an activity such as, this one can improve the way a student might think about an idea a different student could have suggested. Since, these students are in the student council they have to find a way to come up with a decision that implements everyone's ideas. If a student is working on the yearbook they must find a way to add every person's art in it. Even if it means changing it up a little. Teamwork is a big part of joining an extracurricular activity. Though one may not like a person who is the same club, one still has to consider their thoughts as well. Furthermore, a student might not have the confidence to share their own ideas until they join a club or extra activity. When this person see's that people in the student council are being open about their ideas, he/she might start to share. Hiding ideas inside of one may not show their full potential. Extracurricular activities help get rid of that fear a students might have.

Extracurricular activities can make one more confident in their own ability. It not only enhances a student's social skills but also creates a path to a better school life. I believe that the principal's decision was impactful because of all the benefits one can get. Teamwork, health, and social life are not the only enhancements that extracurricular activities provide a student and the whole school with.

077B2A708101,"Some people may think that forcing kids into doing extra circulars, could help them in the future but what if these kids have other reasons that they cant participate in these actives? If my principal tried to force students into doing extra circulars, I would disagree because, there is a large amount of families who will not be able to pay, Students could already have other commitments out of school and making students participate could end up hurting their grades.

First off, In most countries and the United States Poverty rates are very high, meaning more and more families could struggle to let alone put food on the table, then making their kids do a sport that could cost hundreds of dollars may not be possible for lots of families. Sports teams like basket ball or soccer, usually have away games. That could mean having to stay over night, which is also very expensive leaving the families already very pressed on money, to not be able to go or have to rely on other for somewhere to sleep and eat. Even if the Students of these families are thinking of doing the play or debate team, there is usually still some sort of fee to join, or get the shirts and go to events, still leaving families to not have the money needed to participate.

Another reason forcing students to do an school activity is what they are committed to out of school. Students may have to babysit there younger sibling after school, so making the student stay after school one to five times a week. Would force the family to find another way to get the younger sibling taken care of. Sports out of school, most school dont have every sport a student wants to play, forcing the students to join somewhere else. these practices could take up most of their time, so making the students to another activity could end up leaving them no free time, or even having to quit their original sport.

Lastly, if the students actually want to do the sport or activity. There are usually tons of practices leading them to have not much free time in between school and practice. If the student starts to slip on school work and not turn in missing assignments, their grades could and will drop very low. Some kids know how to balance out work and sports, but not all do, so forcing all kids to take away an large amount of time from where they do their homework, Could also end up hurting not just the kids but the schools grade average may go down to.

In conclusion, Forcing kids into doing an Extra circular activity, could end poorly due to, families not have the finances to pay, Students having other commitments out of school and the possibility of students grades being effected poorly by the amount of work need in sports and clubs. If my principle was making a rule forcing every student to participate in an extra circular activity, I would have to disagree with their choices and thoes are my reasons why.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
5CEA51DD2414,"Did you know that the majority of students currently or have participated in extracurricular activities? This is because there are many different forms of extracurricular activities that suit every student's needs or wants. I believe that schools should require every student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they, build friendships outside of school, take the students' mind off the stresses of school and strengthen the body and mind.

Extracurricular activities build close bonds outside of school in many ways. They require students to get to know each other better than if they met at school, such as if they have different classes or friend groups. They Strengthen bonds that have already been formed, like those between two students that share a class. They allow for in inclusion of every student who participates in these activities.

Extracurricular activites are a very good way to relieve stress from school. Such as, if a student has had a bad day at school they can particiapate in their activity and release some of that stress. They also require students to think about things other than school. If a student is having issues with a certain subject in school, they can go to a team practice and stop thinking about that subject for a while. School based extracurricular activities also help form bonds between students and teachers, leading to a higher chance of a student asking for help in class.

Finally, extracurricular activities also help stregthen the body and mind. Students may participate in a book club or the debate team which help build confidence and intelligence therefore increasing school capabilities. However, sports like football or basketball help build physical strength and endurance. Participating in multiple extracurricular activities such as football and the cybersecurity team would be a perfect combination for building strength and intelligence.

The requirement of extracurricular activities is a very beneficial thing interms of building friendships, relieving stress and building physical and mental strength. All of these together create a very good reason why the principle should require every student to participate in at least one or more extracurricular activites. Should this rule be set in place the school shoud expect to see a boost in moral, grades and physical capabilities. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
454FA9C8E4C0,"Some of the students that go to school do not enjoy doing extracurricular activities. I do not agree with the princapal's decision of making it mandatory for students to take an extracurricular activity because, students should have the decision of whether or not they want to take an extracurricular class or do another activity , doing an activity such as a sport requires the student to be good at the sport, and anti social students would not enjoy being pressured into doing an activity that requires communication skills.

Having the choice of doing an extracurricular activity should remain optional. Most students might enjoy not doing an extracurricular activity after school because they might have some other activity or hobby such as playing a video game, or cooking for their family. The students might even enjoy doing an activity out in nature such as fishing or hunting.

Most of the extracurricular activities involve sports, and while some students are good at sports as Babe Ruth is good at baseball, some other students are not good at sports. The reason of why some students are not good at sports could be that they think they are not physically fit, they might not understand how the sport works, or the student simply does not enjoy having to move or run a lot. Above all else sports equipment might cost more money than most people are comfortable spending.

Some students do not like socializing with other people, and most activities that schools offer require communication skills so that the group in the activity can make plans for whatever they will do. The students that do not like to socialize are often known as anti social kids. The anti social kids could feel pressured into having to do an activity that involves having to socialize with other people. Apart from that being pressure into doing something could cause have negative thoughts on the brain which could effect academic skills.

In conclusion it should not be mandatory for students to have to do an extracurricular activity because, students should be able to enjoy doing other activities outside of school, doing an activity such as a sport could require skill and before hand knowledge on sports, and most students that are anti social should not feel being pressured into having to do an activity which requires socialization.  ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
635C6FD4CD45,"Dear, Principal

Most people disagree with your decision to force all students to have an extracurricular activity for many but, fair reasons. The problems with forcing students to participate in a extracurricular activity are hard to miss. Most students are only able to work on homework for three hours. Students will feel exhausted ate school from the extra activities that happen every week day. The students grades will plummet making the school look like a failure. This is why you must change your decision.

First, many students struggle to get their work done in the provided time frame but since most of the extracurricular activities take place after school they won't be able to get their work done. When someone takes away time from the time period the students need they feel like they have to carry the weight of the world by themselves and then they break under the pressure. Some students have preplanned activities with their families who they now can't spend time with. The extra work puts too much pressure on the students. Without time students will ether stay up late or watch as their grades quickly decline.

Second, You will see students come in later and less awake because they are suffering from sleep deprivation. When people are tired they are most likely become unhappy and easily agitated. With bad attitudes the school will have to give out more detentions then ever before.

With more students becoming exhausted students will not pay attention which could become a serious problem students could miss important announcements.

Third, a problem caused by exhaustion can be bad grades. With worse grades summer school attendance will sky rocket making more people give up their summer. With worse grades more common students aren't the only ones suffering, teachers and principles could be under observation by the county or even be fired. With being kicked out of extracurricular activities no longer being a consequence of bad grades the number students going to the school could decrease. With parents wanting their kids to succeed in school the student population will shrink.

With out you changing your choice many problems will be caused for the school. First, without enough time students stay up late. Then, after staying up late they become exhausted. Finally, Without proper rest the grades will decline. So remember, only you can change what you chose so please reconsider for the school and the students' sake.

77D77EE99B3E,"School is a place of learning. It can also be a place to get to know new people. But school lacks student participation in after school activities. Our principle has decided that all students should participate in at least one after school activity. The reason why students should participate in an after school activity is sports, students council, and the yearbook.

The first reason why students should participate in an after is sports. Sports is a great way for the school to be recognized by colleges. Scouts from colleges will want to come to our games to draft kids into their college. Sports will also get the school trophies for students to brag about. Because of all of the trophies the other school sport teams will recognize the school as an actual challenge to go against.

The second reason why students should participate in an after school activity is the student council. The student council can encourage the school to do more fun activities for the students. The students council represents the students, so the students will be able to have a voice. Therefore the council will know what to focus on for the schools.

The final reason why students should participate in after school activities is the year book. Having students as photographer will mean they will take decent pictures. With a lot of students in the yearbook club there will be many pictures to pick from. The yearbook club will make sure students will have memories of the school.

The reason why schools should participate in an after school activity is sports, student council, and yearbook. Sports will help students get recognized by scouts, the sport team will be an actual challenge to beat, and the school will have a lot of trophies. The student council will try to get more fun activities, students will have a voice, the student council will know what to focus on. The yearbook will get students to take good pictures, because of the number of students the yearbook club will have a lot of pictures to choose from, the yearbook club will make sure the students will have memories of the year they had at school. The school needs more participation from the students. With a lot of people participating in after school activities it can make the school a more fun place.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
DFA350B72363,"I agree that you should have to do extracurricular activities. Because its good to go out and do something. And you dont have to do just sports you can do the yearbook, or do band and orchestra. Plus I think all kids should stay active. All in all I agree with doing extra curricular activities.

I think its good to go out and do something because. Kids have more energy than adults. And they need more exercise. And kids can become obese from doing nothing all day. Plus doing extra sports could be fun.

You dont have to do just sports. You could do band and play in the town parade. Or you could do orchestra. Plus, theirs always new stuff you could do if you dont like the thing your doing now. All in all i think kids dont have to do just sports.

Kids should stay active. One reason is so they can stay in shape and it wont be so hard when their adults. And most kids already do sports so maybe they might be able to convince their friends to do it with them. Allot of kids should stay active because its good for their well being. Thats the reasons I think kids should stay active.

In conclusion kids should do extracurricular activities. Its good for them. And it gets them out of the house. Plus it keeps them from being on video games all the time. All in all Kids should have to do extracurricular activities.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
C2128DBEFC42,"I disagree with the principal about this because they should not make someone do something they do not went to do, and Finley they do not know if kids have something after school they needed to do. so this are some resonse why i disagree.

I think kids that get made to do something they will not went to do it. Like for anexple if i was getting made by my principal to do an extracurricular that i do not went to do. so if i did get mad to do one i would have been mad. So they principal should not make people do things.

Then finly, you do not know ehat kids have to do when thye get holme. Say that when i get home I have to leave aging because i ahve work or something elsa to do that is aparten. So if i had to do a extracurricval and i had to stay after school for it. I could not do it becaue i had something elsa that was inparten to do instead of staying after school for the extracurricuar i was made to do.

All this are resons why i do not think we should be made to do a extracurricular. Do you think we should not or should be made to do a extracurricular? ",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
72B5654D61BD,"You may think students should have to do an activity, but should they really be forced to? Students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity be fore, after, or during school. Being forced into something makes kids want to do it less, and doesn't give them the freedom and choice they deserve to have. Extracurricular activities take time and some students may be busy with things like homework or, at this age, working for a little bit of spending money. They also take away from time that could be spent with their families and unwinding after their school day has ended.

Firstly, in middle school, kids are around the ages of 11-15, and they should be considered old enough to make their own decisions. Forcing somebody to do something is never considered a fun thing, or something you'd want yourself. This can lead to more misbehaving, and purposefully missing these activities. Giving the students the choice of doing an extracurricular activity would stop them from misbehaving or coming up with excuses to get out of something they may not want to do. And, let's face it, teenagers are at the stage where they would rather misbehave than listen to authorities, so it would be better to let them have their own choice in the matter.

Second, students may already be doing something after school everyday, meaning they don't have the time to do it in the afternoon. Some kids may have a lot of homework assigned to them by their teachers. Some students may already be doing a sport or activity after school that isn't for the school, maybe for the county or the town. Many students are given a lot of homework in middle school,or have plans after school. Which brings me to my next point.

Extracurricular activities take precious time away from students. This time could be better spent making stronger bonds with their family members, or hanging out with brothers or sisters. While some people may not have siblings, this point still stands. A lot of kids' families are busy, and the one day they aren't they may have a sport or an after school group meeting. Some kids may have family visiting that they only get to see a few times a year, and it would be better for them to spend time with their loved ones instead of running around and kicking or throwing a ball or sitting and talking about school issues.

In conclusion, students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities or sports after school without their consent. They miss time that could be spent with their families, or time that could be used on their in school work or spent on activities they may have that aren't from the school. They also should have the choice to do what they would like to, as they are in middle school and are not just little kids anymore. While you may think this was a good idea, the students and I disagree, and would like our choices back. It would be best for the school's reputation amongst parents and their kids and it would be best for the students themselves to not have to participare in an extracurricular activity.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
6C3A46E13181,"I highly disagree with the Principal's decision that students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I believe that students should be able to choose whether or not do a after school activity. Most of the time kids are exhausted from a long day of school, and want to rest once they get home ,they can't do that if they have an after school activity they have to go to. Often times people have to go home and take care of there younger sibling or other family obligations that are way more important then an after school activity. Some students already have mandatory sport practices and if they do have an after school activity right before it they are just going to waste their energy on that and will be tired for practice. Some work part time jobs after school to help support their family. There are so many more important obligations and they should not have to stay after.

Extracurricular activities are extra for a reason. Extraculicalar activities aren't part of the school day so we should not be forced to stay after. There are students that just dont like after school activities. There is never going to be an activity available that interests everyone. When children's options are taken away such as having to stay for a extracurricular activity they like it less. They like having the option to stay after or to not stay after. Once it becomes mandatory and not a option to stay after it just feel like a chore that has to be done, but you dont want to do. Some students are simply not comfortable with after school activities because, they dread the thought of social interaction, and might be shy. They already have to deal with being scared of social interaction at school but then after school and it just makes them even more stressed and anxious. Kids like to take a break and have fun with their friends after school and much rather do that.

The students will have less time to do their homework. When students stay after they have less time to do their homework or school projects. Students often stay up all night just to get there projects done or even study. School work is way more important than extracurricular activities. When a student has to do so many things at once they get very stressed and worn out. A kid might have to stay after then right after have practice for a sport then after have to work on a project till late. When students Sleep late they have even less energy at school the next day and often wont even be able to pay attention without falling asleep. If students have a test the next day they wont be awake enough to even remember the right answers.

In conclusion I do not agree

I think that there is no reason for the principal to make everyone do an extracurricular activity extracucilar activities should be a choice. most have sports,jobs,family obligations,,just dont wanna go or have school work that needs to be done. After school being mandatory takes freedom away and as a child you already dont have much freedom so you should be able to choose whether or not you stay after. If a student likes after school then they will stay after school ,but if a student doesnt stay after they obviously dont due to not wanting to or having obligations. Students are stressed enough with school work and projects to be having to do a after school activity. The students will not enjoy it if it is mandatory because children like having freedom. I disagree with the principals decision.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
345C6337479E,"Have you ever wanted to be in a club but were afraid of meeting people? Did you ever think about expanding your mind in trying something different or challenging? Or, maybe, you just wanted to join ceramics or drama? Many of us, especially teens, worry about talking to new peers of ours. so we never try it. If we never attempt to go the extra mile to do something, we might miss out on the chance of meeting a life long confidant. After-school activities guide us into doing things out of our comfort zones to enjoy many unknown hobbies. These special groups provide such enjoyment and laughter to thousands of children. I agree with the decision that all students may participate in at least one extracurricular because it takes away unnecessary stress, gives new topics to learn about, and students can make new friends.

First, learners should take at least one extracurricular because it removes unneeded stress. For example, it creates an enjoyable part of school at the end of the day. As every teacher knows, students don't favor school very much and adding an exciting aspect to it will let them relieve all that built up information about tests and homework. Also, this provides a way of releasing all stress by having a specific time that contributes to doing so. When kids don't go straight home and start their homework, they feel more at ease and relaxed about their schoolwork and don't feel pressured. Furthermore, clubs let young thinkers forget about the crazy nonsense that might've occurred at school that day. Maybe students got sent to the office and are worked up about that, this assists them by going somewhere where no one judges you and keeps you as calm as possible. Therefore, removing stress is a big factor on why learners should participate in an extracurricular.

Second, these activities give new topics to learn about. For instance, many young adults might be unsure about their interests, and they could make it clear for themselves. You might believe you hate art, but when you join the school club for it, it could be your dream profession to become an artist. Everyone will be able to discover their passions at their own pace. Additionally, if a person wants to be apart of a cultural learning group, it will grow their mind to understand different races and nationalities to compare to their own. While attempting to understand a unknown area, children enrich their knowledge of the world. Moreover, teens can have an opportunity to talk and address issues that are not taught in the classroom. They might touch on World War II in History, but if they want to go into it more in depth, World War II Club will provide them with that. In summary, extracurricular gives brand new items to go deeper into, which helps in the many ways listed above.

Lastly, people can make new friends. Many professors and parents believe that pushing our kids to meet new peers is wrong and shouldn't be accepted. They say that they should gradually build up the courage to speak up. But why not head start them into the path of publicly speaking to people they don't know. Many children haven't been taught how to be confident, so I believe adding these activities will add that to the curriculum. When put in these groups, students are exposed to others with unique backgrounds. They all can share their own point of views to start up collaboration, which can lead to becoming best friends forever. Another point is the freedom of seeing people outside of your classes is added. When you have a pattern of saying hi to a variety of colleagues, you make more connections that could possibly last a lifetime. Introverts also have the chance of conversing very often. They are sometimes misunderstood and handing them a way of being understood might let them open up a bit. All in all, knowing new faces and personalities could create a way of adding friends.

In conclusion, I agree with the decision that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it removes stress, it promotes the making of new friends, and gives a variety of topics to learn about. Every teenager should go out and try something they haven't. They should understand that this new rule actually benefits them in ways that they never even noticed. You need to take risks to have new experiences in your life to look back on. ""New and ""different"" might be scary words to hear, but sometimes change and interaction is fascinating. Just take that leap of faith, and everything will work out in the end. When you join that ceramics club, all your fears of people and challenge will go away. Your mind will expand, and it could turn out to be your passion.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
C318777ECE9F,"Must all students participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity? Some schools make their students participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity whether the students want to or not, the students don't really have a say. I disagree, students shouldn't have to participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity. The principle might just want to help the students so that they can get into a good college or just into a good school in general. There are many reasons as to why students shouldn't be made to take an extracurricular activity. Some reasons as to why students shouldn't be made to take an extracurricular activity is simply because they might not have time, their parents may not want them to, and they might just not be interested in extracurricular activities at the moment.

Having to take an extracurricular activity is a big responsibility in a way. Students might not have time because just like anybody else they also have a life outside of school and they have things that they need to do everyday. They might need to watch their siblings while their parents are at work, also they have homework for almost every class and apart from that they still have to do chores around the house. The students might really want to do a sport or join a club or maybe even do both but they might not be able to. The reason being is because they would then have to go after school so that they can go to practice for a sport or meet up with the other people from the club. There's a specific time you have to be there and if you can't make it you might get kicked out of the club or sport or any other extracurricular activities.

Not having enough time might not be an issue but maybe their parents just dont want them to participate in anything. There are many reasons as to why this can happen, the student might get hurt really easily if its a sport or maybe even by doing simple everyday things, their parents might not be able to take them back to school when school is over because they might not have transportation, the parents could even possibly think that its dumb. There are many more reasons as to why their parents might just not want them to join a club or a sport or even just an after school class. The parents have their reasons because it's their child and they want to do what's best.

Lastly the student might just not want to do anything at the moment. They get a lot to do in school and they still get homework, then when they get home they might just want to relax. They might be thinking about doing sports or something else this upcoming year but just not now. students get really stressed with all the work that they get that they might just not want to add more stress by having one more thing to worry about. maybe they are military and they might have to move to a whole different place where they don't know anyone so they want to take a year off to get to know some people before they start joining anything.

Students shouldn't be made to take an extra curricular activity because they simply might not have time, their parents might just not want them to, or they might just not want to take any extracurricular activities at the moment. They should be able to have a choice of whether they want to take an extracurricular course or not. Students shouldn't have to do more than they have to if they really just don't want to or if they can't. Students are trying their very best in school so they shouldn't be made to take an extracurricular activity if they don't have to.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
4DA6DE1267AC,"I dont think that all kids have to participate in extracirricular activities because some families dont have enough money to pay the fees or pay for the equipment needed for that activity which isnt fair and most sports and activities do cost a lot of money. And there probably is some activities that dont cost anything but what if you dont want to to that one what if you want to play baseball for the school team, but it cost one hundred and fifty dollars and your family cant afford or, say you can afford the sign up fee but how about the cleats,the glove,the bat,the bag,the jersey,the pants and the hat all that stuff adds up very quickly and thats a pretty popular and expensive sport.

It's also not fair to the kids who already play a sport or do something else outside of school and you dont have time to do both what are you going to do its pretty stressful just thinking about it and, your still are a student so say you have baseball practice then after baseball you have band practice but the next day you have a huge math test so what do you do school or practice? it can really affect your mental health dealing with all that stress and tension on what your going to do which could cause grades to drop off or, maybe your good at school and you play for a little league baseball team but now you have to do a extracirricular activity for school and your start to get more tired every day. Your performance at baseball drops and your grades drop because you dont have enough time to study and yeah, you could study after practice but by the time you get back it will be nine o'clock and you stay up and study so when you usually go to bed a nine thirty now your going to bed a eleven thirty and your tired the next day and you fall asleep and you get a zero in that class and you flunk the math test because your so tired. It's just not fair because you dont have all the time in the world.

Sometimes you have family issues where someone in your family is hurt or injured or in trouble and you have to be there for them every day but, you have a meeting on Monday so what do you do go care for your family member or even friend or do you to the meeting ? thats the question you have to ask yourself. Say your lost someone in your family but your mind isnt in the right spot and your just not in it that day but you have practice and it makes you more stressful because now you are going to have to pay attention on the next practice because you missed this one its very hard to decide and its not fair at all.

It's all so very stressful just thinking about it and stress can affect you in many bad ways such as attitude, effort, sleep, grades, performance just all around it can drag you down in a bad way thats why I disagree with the principals decision to make every student do at least one extracurricular activity.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I know more people probably like sports a little bit more than clubs only because they actually like what there playing or there doing it to be popular. you also have games to worry about and i know that the players are nervous before the games. clubs are just something to do if your bored and wanna join something and there for fun and theres nothing to worry about. a few people i know are already popular or have popular friends and they do sports to probably stay popular. sports help you for the real world like a tennis player or a nba basketball player.,2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
AF214D4C47A5,"Almost 50% of students in our school sign up for extracurricular activities. That is half of our school! But, there is another half to our school who do not participate in extracurricular activities. They all have their own reasons to not take part in these activities and should not be penalized for a reason which they might not be able to avoid. Therefore, I disagree with our principles decision to make it mandatory for students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students need that extra time to dedicate it towards their family and other activities that they go to which they prefer over the ones in school, they might feel various negative effects due to these activities, and they also might dislike the options that they are provided with in school.

Students need this extra time to use it for their families and other recreational things they do after school.. They might have to hurry to their homes because they have to pick up their siblings. I know many who go home quickly without any hesitation because they have to pick up his or her young sister or brother who can't walk home from where his or her school bus stops by themselves. Many students live far away and do not get a school bus and could get tired after an after school activity, making them unable to walk to their homes. Now, unless they can take the bus to near their homes or have a parent or guardian pick them up, this will be very problematic for them, especially for the people who decide to take part in a sports activity. People also sign up for other things that amuse them after school. For example, a student might have been part of a soccer team which they played for and trained with after school. This necessity of having to go to an after school activity becomes a huge roadblock if they want to really succeed as a soccer player or any sport in general. All in all, over usage of time by our school seems to be a big problem caused by these activities.

Schools are funded based off of how their students perform and these after school activities play a role in grade drops. Learners are often stressed out in school already because heavy loads of homework or assignments in school and extracurricular activities will more likely stress them out furthermore. The likelihood of an after school activity which isn't fun and requires you to study in a boring way, is high. Our school even makes us do homework for 3/4 of Gaming club where we are supposed to be having fun and gaming with our friends. Which also leads me to the point that some activities are misleading. Students get upset when they realize that they signed up to do homework for almost the entire time in Gaming club. Once students get a firm grasp of the idea that the activities that they are doing are not serving their purpose, they will lose interest in those activities and maybe even school. Loss of interest in school is already caused by the core subjects. And placing down more things for students to learn makes them more viable to give up on school. Basically, schools would be seen as manipulating and stressing their students out to what they think ""benefits"" them.

Teachers and the school, and of course mainly our principle, may think that putting down a rule to have to be ""using your time for learning and having fun"" makes us more productive. But in reality, it very much does not. The country with the best education system does not force work onto students by putting down homework on their backs. They instead, educate them in a fun and memorable way. Students will remember the time that they all hopped in a Minecraft server to learn math, and will most likely forget the time that they had to do five pages of math homework for two hours straight just to get a C on that homework. The manipulative part about these activities do not help the school in any way. Deceptive ways to get your students to work will backfire. So, schools should just approach this situation with more concern for the students.

All schools are not like this, so why should we be. Tricking our students to ""learn"", using up their time to force them to, once again, ""learn"" and stressing them our with these activities to make them ""learn"" should not be the way to go. School should invest more time listening to the voices of the students that they teach and adapt to modern times. Everything changes to fit the standards of modern society.

AF1693F74897,"You have just scored the game winning goal for your soccer team. ""Goal"", the crowd roars. Your team crowds around you with joy. This is a famillar feeling for students who take part in extracurricular activities. Whether its the newspaper club, robotics club, or the football team. These students get to feel a sense of acomplishment when he or she takes part in extracurricular activities. Therefore all students should be required to take part in an extracurricular activity. Joining these activities will help students make friends, explore future carrer options, and learn life lessons.

Students will be able to make new friends if they are required to take extracurricular activities. For example they will be able to find students with simillar hobbies as them. To add on students will learn communication skills which they can use to make firends. For instance if a student were to join soccer they would have to talk to eachother to know who to pass the ball to and when. Lastly they will meet more of their new peers who are also apart of the same club or sport who they might have not ever met before. In conclusion extracurricular activities help students make friends.

Extracurriculars also help students explore future carrer options. First of all students can figure out what they are good at and explore future jobs that match those skills. For example if a student was in the yearbook club and he or she was really good at drawing they could look into future carrers as an artist or graphic designer. Also speakers come in every two months and speak about their jobs and how students could pursue their dream jobs. Furthermore students have a chance to get a scholarship to college for doing a sport. Then they could continue that sport in college. Also being good at a sport will make it easier for them to get into their dream college. Which is why extracurriculars help students explore future carrer choices.

Lastly by requiring students to take extracuriculars students learn important life lessons. For example student learn how to be good leaders. This is because in extracuriculars there is always a captain selected if you are selected as captain you learn how to be a good leader but, if u aren't selected as the leader you learn how to be a team player and how to follow a leader. To add on you learn how to balance your time. Therefore you must be able to keep up with all the stuff you have to do in your club and your school work at the same time. Lastly another life lesson you learn in clubs is how to communicate properley and respectfully with your fellow peers. These are a few of the may life lessons you learn while taking part in an extracurricular activity.

All students should be required to take at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurriculars encourage and help students make friend, explore future carrer options, and learn life lesseon. As a student body we must stress to all students how important it is to follow the principals wishes and, join extracurricular activities.        ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
C0971C7AC826,"Imagine being on a field and you just scored the winning goal while your school is chanting your name. Being involved in an extracurricular activity at your school can have so many benefits and even receiving little compliments that make your day can be a benefit. Students should participate in at least one extra curricular activity because they can show off their talents,have fun,and develop life skills.

One benefit of participating in an extracurricular activity is that students can get a chance to show off their talents such as in sports. A student could be insecure about other things going on in their life like family issues or friendship problems and they could have this one activity that can make them feel good and proud about themselves. Being proud of yourself is a very important aspect and everyone should have something they are proud about so they can show it. Another amazing part about showing off your talent is that it could influence others to try and find their hidden talent. You could change someone's life by influencing them and all they might have needed was somebody to reassure them to try. Lastly,it can make the people around you proud such as your family,friends,school and community. Knowing you made the people who love you proud is heartwarming and everyone should be able to experience that. Showing your talent is not the only benefit of participating in an extracurricular activity.

Another benefit you can get from joining an activity at school is you get to have fun such as working on the yearbook. Having the same everyday routine after school can be very boring and you could get tired of it so changing your schedule, it could even be by a little, can be fun. Trying new things can be entertaining and can be good for you in many ways. Another way activities can be fun is you are able to make new friends who have the same interests as you and enjoy certain things you enjoy as well. Making new friends can impact you in many ways such as impacting who you are. Lastly,having fun before you enter adulthood is very important since you might not be able to do all these activities when you grow up. Have all the fun you can as a kid before it all gets taken away from you. Having fun is one of the many benefits about joining an activity at your school.

However, some people don't think students should join an extra curricular activity. Some people may think this because students already have to do so much at home and they are already so busy. This is wrong because students should be able to learn and have life skills for their future. Having time management is something every student should be able to do before entering adulthood and why not practice now? When we become adults we are going to have a lot of work on our hands and we aren't going to know how to manage all the work since we didn't have an previous experiences similar to this in school. Life skills are one of the most important skills there are.

3392F73AE2DB,"Don't you think students would be happier if they participated in a extracurricular activity? Playing a sport or serve on the student council or even working on the year book are some of the extracurricular activities a student can participate in. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would take students minds off of school work and its healthier for them.

My first reason why I think students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity is because it would take students minds off of school work. School can be very stressful and sometimes students just need to get away from all the test and homework. Participating in a extracurricular activity can help a student feel more relaxed and not worry about school that much. Students might even focus more in school and do better on there test.

My second reason why I think students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity is because it's healthy for students. Students won't be as moody or stressed out. Being stressed out might affect the student and they might feel overwhelmed and not want to try in school. By participating in a activity like a sport or other activities it can help students not feel so stressed out or overwhelmed.

To wrap it all up, students should participate in extracurricular activities because it can help them take there mind off school work and its healthy for them. School can be stressful and students might feel overwhelmed by it.

E2BB0AA98EA5,"Well i dissagree because,why can the teachers do the work always wanting students to help so i dissagree because if they can do it they shouldnt make other people wanna do it,but i would also work on the yearbooks beacuse you are the one who is doing it all so you do it the way u want to. Kids should also have multipul choices to choose what they wanna do because here they only give them like three options that honestly is not far well thats my opinon other people might think other wise. I also agree because it will help kids get personal stuff outta there mind example parents fighting,getting bullied,over thinking,depression,there are many more examples these are just ones that came out of my mind because i wouldnt really think about stuff like this. Student council is actually really good i used to be in it but i got kicked out because my behavior and grades when i was in it i didnt put much effort like i didnt care about it but it was the only thing that had my grades good and now since im not in it i never have anything to do i wish i would have not behave the way i had so i would have not gotten kicked out but it is what it is. The principal actually is thinking because he does what new things for them in life so when they grow up they can say i did this i didnt do this and on the other hand if u dont do that you wont be able to even have fun you have to try new things in life because without trying you wont get anywhere in life. I also think they should have more options for the students to choose because not all students might like those options maybe they have other things in mind like gaming like you never know what they could be thinking you should let them speak out maybe they have even better ideas you never know because students have open minds some people dont know that. I just want you to let the students have a voice and not just the adults but its your school you do you boo.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
CF882151082B,"Do you like extracurricular activity? If you dont know what that is some examples are sports,newspaper,and student council. I believe that students should choose at least one extracurricular activity,because it will make students more social,and they get to see what they like doing.

How will extracurricular activities make students more social? Since,most clubs make it so you have to talk to some one you will eventually talk to another student. Also you might find some one who is interested in the same things as you and make a friend.

Being in a extracurricular activity could help find what you like doing. For instance,you could find that playing football is your thing. With all the different activities there is no way you will not find the thing you like.

Hopefully I convinced you to be on my side. However, if your still not convinced that is fine. In conclusion,extracurricular activity help students be social and find what they enjoy.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
6645078FF1DD,"Some schools or principals say that taking a extracurricular can be good for many students . This means students can take extra or another class other than your, Civics, Science, English, or Math. Some classes can be yearbook crew, photography crew or maybe a computer crew! Anything is a good choice.

Being in a extracurricular class can help you learn something new. When being in a extracurricular class means you learn something different than your usual subjects.

You can have chance to learn your favorite subject example;Art. Extracurricular classes makes you open your mind to other things or be open mined. When you want a job on the class you are taking, it can help you have a better understanding if what that subject or job, is going to be about. People still take their usual classes, but they might need more help. So they take a extra class to help them get better at the subject they are struggling with.

When is a extracurricular class or activity you can be more social or make more friends. When in extra activity class you are most likely be in a group of people. Being in a group with a lot of people can make you more social and have a voice. Communication is key, so when you are in a group you can be better at communication. When being social you meet someone that you feel more comfortable talking to. For example, when you are in a class that you or, a student doesn't feel comfortable talking in you can talk to the teacher cause maybe, they are the only person in the room you are comfortable talking with.

In some certain classes you can go traveling or go on a trip. For example, if you are taking a music class than, you can choose to go on the trip. This also helps you getting out of the house more. Some students love to travel sometimes it helps them learn new thing on a subject. When traveling in a school trip you probably wont have your parents there with you, cause they might have work. So when you go on a trip by yourself, it teaches you how to take care of yourself and how to be more dependent. Some students have bad parents so traveling with your friends and taking a break from your mom or dad can be a good thing for some students. However, some students or parents think its bad for students to go off on their own. Some say that it can be dangerous and that something might happen to their child.

Being in a extracurricular activity isn't always a bad thing. It can maybe get you into a good job in the future. There are many reasons on why taking a extracurricular class or activity.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
09C8F49982B9,"Research has shown that exercising does help you live longer. However what if you were forced to do a sport or something after school that is not a sport? Me personally I disagree, but I am going to talk about my opinions on why right now.

People shouldn't have to do anything after school if they don't want to. Staying after school is a opportunity to have fun and see some of your friends. Therefore if it was forced it would defiantly not be as much fun because you wouldn't want to do it. Nobody should be forced to do something if they don't want to.

There are other things people want or have to do sometimes instead of staying after school everyday. It would take away some of the fun. For instance what if someone wants to go out of town but they can't because they have to stay after school. Additionally people have other things to do outside of school, things like ballet, basketball for someplace else, maybe any sport, etc.. If they did then they would be burned out like a fire in the rain.

Having homework and having to stay after everyday would be terrible. With having to stay after school also comes homework. We at least have one thing to do everyday, sometimes more. With that being said some after school activities last 2:30-4:00 or 2:30-6:30. Homework usually takes 20 minutes tops depending on what it is, but when you have 2 or 3 things to do you can't go to bed until late. Also studying can be hard with an after school activity because that really takes a long time. Additionally, you still have to shower and do things to prepare for the next day which makes you go to bed even later when you have to wake up at 5:30-6:30AM. Only that is whole different subject for a while different time.

Staying after school is fun but if you were forced it would change everything. People stay after because they want to, not because they are forced too. It would defiantly not be fair if people were forced too. That is my opinion on this question.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
F1F3B4EA6FC4,"Starting at a young age and throughout their life, every child and person wants to be great at something. If you look at the people who are truly great at what they do, they all started their passion at a young age. Many sports players, politicians, and people in all fields are a great example of this. Quite frankly, extracurricular activities are a great way to spur interest within students in their youth. For this reason, I believe that the principal made the right decision about making students do at least one extracurricular activity. Beside for getting students to develop an interest and passion for something at a young age, extracirrular activities also help people become more confident in their abilities. Additionally, with all of these options, there has to be at least one activity for each student to have an interest in.

As I stated earlier, extracurricular activities are a great way to get students to find a new interest. For all you know, the student may really like the activity and pursue it as a profession. Without being required to do the activity, the student may not have even discovered their interest in whatever the activity is. Requiring students to do extracurricular is a great way to open new door and possibilities for the student. There are many different activities the student can take, so at least one has to be appealing. By finding out what they have an interest in, and starting at a young age, the student will have plenty of time to develop the skills need at get really good at something. It is important to be unique in at least one thing, because it helps identify who you are as a person. Even if the student does not ""fall in love"" with their activity, it still could not hurt to try something new.

Staying on the topic of learning something new, extracirrular activities are a great way to get students out of their comfort zone and to build up self-confidence. If the school did not require the student to take an extracurricular activity, chances are that the student would not have tried out something new. By making students try something new or continue something that they are already good at, it is making them better at whatever they are doing. This boosts their confidence level, and makes them want to try even more new things. Additionally, many of these clubs and activities include working with other people and students. This means that these clubs help students with their communication, organization, and teamwork skills. Personally, I am on my school's debate team, and I enjoy not only having fun and tournaments, but also working with my friends that are also on the team. Even though I do not really plan on becoming a lawyer or politician, I still feel as if being on the team has made me a more confident and clear speaker. Helping develop important life skills is once again another benefit of making requiring students to take at least one extracurricular activity.

Whether it is a sport, club, or leadership position, there is always something for each and every student. Based on the field that the person wants to go in, they can do an activity that is related to that field. For example, if the person wanted to be a politician, they could do something relating to the student council. Out of the many choices for extracurricular activities, at least one has to fit each student. Even if the student is not sure what they want to be, there are also plenty of options such as sports that are plenty of fun!

Although some people may say that it is not right to force somebody into doing an activity, or say that there are better things the person can do with that time, the whole purpose of requiring students to do after school activities is so they can get better. Not only do extracurricular actitivites help give students important life skills, but they also give students a chance to gain an interest and passion in an activity. If anything, it just giving the students another opportunity to try out something new. It is almost guaranteed that every student will find something that they can manage, so there is no downsides of requiring students to do extracurricular activities.

As I mentioned earlier, it is best for people start something at a young age, and requiring students to take extracurricular activities is a great way to do that. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
B71521CCA4F4,"I think that this new rule is necessary.

Have you ever worked to be apart of something bigger than yourself? It's a great feeling! Whether it be a group project or the school play; it's all a group effort. Everyone having at least one extracurricular activity gives us students the chance to develop their skills and talents, it'll give us experience for our future work place, and give us a chance to make ever lasting friendships bettering the group efforts.

Working on an extracurricular activity can help us learn talents and while developing older skills. Some students may learn important social skills and, other can develop those skills. Many students have hidden talents yet, might not ever be able to use it if they're just doing standard desk work. I hope with this new rule we can all express ourselves while learning from valuable experience.

In recent years, studies have shown that 66% of students who joined a club or have done an extracurricular have a higher chance of getting into colleges or getting a job. A lot of people can benefit from extra work experiences. Jobs and colleges are looking for talented individuals who know how to work. I think that is reason enough to start this program.

These activities give students who only want to socialize with people like them a place to meet others. Students with similar interests working together can be a force of good. When you get to learn and work beside those who you are comfortable with you'll do and feel much better. With everyone working together and no one is excluded everyone gets to help out and be apart of the group.

Giving student a place where they can learn and develop talents and skills while also giving them work experience and, helping the meet new people is definitely a good idea. A school where students are able to express themselves in their own creative groups. That will not only give us great memories but, will also help us as adults.

8A516907464A,"Imagine, your principal tell you that we will have one extra activity in school. I agree because having extra activity is more good. Because students will stay healthy,learn more,and do something they are interstate in. for example,sports,art,science. Also students will love to come to school because they love different activities.

First,By give students activity is healthy because scholars will not get bore by jest seating in one class. For example, some pupil gets bore be seating like one hour in one class. Also extra activity make students feel more happy. because,by going to one class and other and walking and not seat all the time make them happy. And being happy in school it every thing students need in school. Also,by giving them extra activity scholars will have more energy in school. Because taking extra activity is more en joyful for students. And students get more energy by going to one class to another like walking give them people a lots of energy.

father more,By giving scholars extra activity students can learn more. Because one extra activity can help them now how other activity are and how to learn that activity. Also,giving extra activity will help them know what activity they like. And it will make students do good at another things too. Learning new things in life is important for everyone. For example,you take activity about sport and later in life you sign in a collage you will win because you all ready take activity about sport. extra activity can help students anywhere in life. Also,extra activity can makes life easy and you will have a great job because of activity and you can have different job too.

Finally, extra activity can make you in different interstate's things. Also, extra activity can make scholars do something they are interstates in. For example,sport,art,and life science the things students can choose on of the activity. And one extra activity can make there dream come true. For example,i love to play soccer and i take activity about sport and it make my dream become true because i wanted to become the best soccer player. And even it i was not interstate in sport activity help me to become interstates in it. For example, i was not interstate in art but when i take the activity i become interstate in art and know i love it. So extra activities can show me what i am interstate in for example,some students do not like sports and when they take extra activity they start full in love with it.

clearly, i agree that students should have extra activity because it will make students stay healthy like make them feel happy. Also,extra activity will make them learn more fast like different thing that they never try. And it can make them interstate in different things and they can make there dream become true what ever they wanted to be.

A222B298A2BF,"My principal decided that all students must participate at least in one extracurrcular activity.

Which means that our school has to be active and involved in a sport,club,or play.

There is a lot of pros and cons about this.

Aditionally, i think it can be great for my school to have a rule like this.

I agree with my principal because, its nice to be invlved,people could really enjoy the extracurricular activites, and to make new friends.

Have you ever been involved in something that you loved? For example, running is something that I love and enjoy, I would most likely to participate in track and field. Being in something can make you want to be more productive.

Being productive helps you be more busy and on task.

If you want to be more involved with something you have to participate during the activity.

The defionition of doing something that you enjoy means, being happy while doing something that you like.

What do like doing during your free time?

Doing something that fits you personality has a big cnnection with enjoying what makes you happy. aditionally,

Doing something that you love means you have a connection to it.

Doing something that you like can make you emotion be more positive and increase in a great way.

Do you just have that friend that you can talk to about anything?

Well, in this case you can make that friend in any of the activities.

To make new friends is important to schools, so you can have someone to connect to. comunication skills are almost required in colleges and used in future jobs.

Making a friend can lead to more friends which can make your mood change in a great way.

In conclusion,

I think we should be able to have a requirement for people to be in extracurectular activites.

Its important to be more social and to have more friends.

If you disagree or agree, I think it will be nice to be included in something they enjoy.

It can help you in the fuyture by having amazing communication skills.

Its good to be involved, people could really enjoy the activity, and to make new friends, those are the reasons why I agree with my principal.            ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
62A99B6D846E,"Have you ever participated in an extracurricular activity before?

Who or what made you participate or join that extracurricular activity and benefit from it? Many schools convince or make students participate in extracurricular activities such as sports, working on the year book,or serving on the student council to make them active in order to prevent them from being idle apart from school based activities. I agree that our principle should make us participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it keeps us fit and healthy, it improves our brain function and it can create an opportunity for students to find their talents.

The first reason I agree that the principle should make students participate in extracurricular activities is that it keeps us fit and healthy. For instance,take a sport such as basketball. Most basketball players are fit and healthy because basketball serves as a physical activity which makes them be in a very good shape for any situation. Playing basketball can also make people healthy by burning fat from their bodies and preventing their blood vessels from being clogged. Being fit and healthy means a lot to the school ,and that is why the principle should make us participate in extracurricular activities

The second reason I agree that the principle should make students participate in extracurricular activities is that it can improve our brain function. Apart from school activities, students can also acquire more knowledge to improve their brain function by participating in extracurricular activities. I once read an article on a website named ""Gale."" It stated that scientists have proven that students that have participated extracurricular activities in schools have improved brain function and has made them more attentive, more quite and more discipline ,but I didn't believe that until my friend from another school,which has extracurricular activities,told me he joined the student's council. At first, I told him it wasn't going to do him any but in a few weeks, I noticed changes about my friend. He had become much more brilliant and more knowledgeable. He told me it was because he joined the students council and it improved the ability of his brain to think and to act some ways. So improved brain functions of students is one thing we would benefit from if our school was introduced to extracurricular activities.

The final reason

I agree that the principle should make students participate in extracurricular activities is that it can help students find their unknown talents. An example I would like to share is that my elder sister was in high school ,and she participated in the extracurricular activities. At first, she didn't want to participate in it ,but my mom edged her to do it because she saw her juggling her ball ,and my mom saw that she was very good at soccer. She could have made her join a youth team for soccer ,but she didn't have enough money. When my sister joined, she didn't perform well at all ,but when the coach motivated her, she showed her through colors. She led the school's women soccer team to win the district finals and the state finals. People always asked her where she had acquired these skills for soccer ,but she had only one answer,"" I didn't discover my talent until I joined my school's extracurricular activity."" She is now a big superstar play in Europe for a club named Arsenal. So many talents can be revealed if the principle could make everyone participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

In conclusion, I agree that the principle should make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it keeps us fit and healthy, it improves our brain function and it can create an opportunity for students to find their talents although one might disagree with my decision.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
BB281953DF01,"Some people agree with making students participate in extracurricular activities instead of letting the students stay home and do what they want to. This is wrong and cause many problems. I disagree with making students participate in extracurricular activities because students may not have time to participate in these activities, they may not be interested in the activities that their school provides, and they may not be able to complete school assignments.

The first point is that students may not have time for these activities. For instance, students could be participating in other events that are not provided by the school. If students tried to participate in both activities, one could get in the way of another and cause issues. Students may also miss the activities because they are spending time with their families. If they were forced to go to these activities, they could loose the time they would be spending with their family by participating in the activities. Another problem that could occur is the parents not having the time to take their children their activities. This could be cause by work or any other event that the parents must attend.

The next point is that students may not be interested in the activities that their school provides. This could be because the school may not have many activities. If the school does not have many activities, some students will be left out and forced to choose one that they do not want to participate in. Another reason could be that the school does not have the money for specific activities. For example, a student may want to participate in wrestling, but the school cannot provide the needed gear and mats. This would mean that the student cannot participate in an activity that they would like to participate in.

The final point is that students may not be able to complete assignments. If a student has a very important test that they must take, they have to study for it. If the student cannot study for tests, they may get a poor grade. Students may also have projects or homework that must be completed. If they do not complete these things, the student's grade could fall and they would have to work harder to raise it. If they still did not have the time to work extra because of the required activity, they could suffer from an even poorer grade.

In conclusion, students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because students may not have time to participate in these activities, they may not be interested in the activities that their school provides, and they may not be able to complete school assignments. If students are required to participate in these activities, many problems could arise.    ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
3E24163B824B,"Isolation. Nothing to do. That's what most kids do when they get home. Play video games or sit on their phones for hours. That's why schools should have students participate in one extracurricular activity. This could help make students happier and healthier, improve social skills, and give opportunities to explore their interest.

One reason schools should have students participate in one activity is because it makes students healthier and happier. Studies from John Hopkins university stated that ""9 out of 10 kids are happier when they participate in activities."" Which means more students are in a better mood because they're moving around and getting exercise. Getting kids to go outside can improve their mood swings. Not only does it help with mood swings, it also helps with depression. Healthier and happier students tend to be more happier in general

Another reason kids should have extracurricular activities is because it improves social skills. Professor Jimmy Facs, from University of New York, says, ""kids who get involved in out of school activities, have better social skills than kids that do not participate in anything. Also, getting involved in out of school activities help kids with anxiety."" Facs basically is saying that out of school activities helps kids get out of their comfort zone. Pre-teens who have anxiety could feel more safe around the people at their school. Kids that participate in extracurricular activities could also meet new friends that they've never talked to or even see before. Meeting new people could form a better community at this school.

Another important reason is that extracurricular activities could open up new opportunities or interest for students. A survey from students at Generic_School shows that 3 out of 4 students find a new hobby or interest that they enjoy. This means that kids could try something they've never tried before. Finding more interests for students could help them open up their choices of what they want to become when they grow up. This could also help students find people who have the same interest.

Some parents and students complain that they won't have time for homework. In an article produced by the Board of Supervisors of the Generic_City says, ""kids that participate in multiple sports still come home to homework. This could make the student stress and have a mental breakdown."" The Board of Supervisors of the Generic_City is stating that kids mental health is bad because they have multiple activities going on. Although some students say they get stressed from more extracurricular activities, most kids already participate in one. In an article by Generic_Name, she states, ""5 out students 6 say they already participate in sports. A student from Generic_School, Generic_Name, even says, 'I play 4 sports and I have never been stressed. Playing 4 sports actually makes me feel less stressed.'"" Generic_Name is saying that most kids play sports to relax them. Relaxation makes students feel more focused in school. Putting all your anger into playing a sport can make students more calm when it comes to challenges. Less stress can help students loosen up.

Overall, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It helps students be healthier and happier, improves their social skills, and opens up more opportunities. Activities benefits both you and your community. Your community can do is support sports by, going to a game. What you can do is, participate in an activity you've never tried before. Open up more opportunities for yourself. See what's out there, you'll never know until you try.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0

7D577B9D3888,"The principal can decide a lot of things, but not decide what a student does before or after school. I disagree with the principal's idea of making all students do one extracurricular activity. First issue is, it extends an already drawn out school day, making the day last an extra hour or two. Also, a student's talent may not represented in a club, therefore making them feel left out. Finally, students may have outside of school routines, or work they must do, and this rule interferes with their routine. This idea is taking away a bit more of a student's free will, thus leading to my argument. I disagree with the idea of making all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it extends an already long school day, could make students feel left out because their talent isn't represented, and can interfere with a students after school or before school routine. Now, onto a more in-depth look.

First of all, the school day issue. School can already be long and tiring, so there's no need to make it longer for students. While some may enjoy sports or other extracurricular activities, those who do not are wasting their time by doing an activity they may not enjoy. Students typically only have around 5 hours of free time outside of school. Add an extra two hours and now they have 3 hours, and some of that time will be used to do homework leaving little time to do what they enjoy. This can stress students out and lead to depression, and make them dread going to school because the entire day is eaten up by it. Along with these points, a student may not have a club or activity they fit into, leading me to my second point.

Next up, students may not have their talents represented in clubs or activities. Some students may be very good in a certain thing, such as writing stories, or sculpting, or some other talent that isn't very popular. This then leads to them having nowhere to go, leaving them with something they don't enjoy. If the school doesn't have a club or activity that suits them, then they shouldn't have to participate in one. If they do, it's just extra work that'll bore them. Clubs are supposed to be enjoyable, and help students find others that have the same interests as them, but if participating in a club or activity is mandatory, students may feel left out, and not included. They may be excluded and picked on for having a talent that others can't relate to,or be picked on for not being good at something.

Finally, it may interfere with a student's before or after school routine. In the morning, most students have a routine they follow. If they have an activity that begins 45 minutes before school, they have to rearrange their whole schedule. This can lead to them losing sleep, not getting a good enough breakfast, and generally under prepared for school. If a student has an after school activity, this can change and shorten their routine. If they get home, do homework, play games for 2 hours, eat dinner, shower, and then go to sleep, an activity can limit these things to less games or enjoyable activities, not as much of a dinner, and the day being taken up by mostly homework. It can cancel their time to relax or have fun, and cause a routine change. It shouldn't be up to the school to choose a students after or before school life, and throw off their entire schedule.

To summarize, I disagree with the principal's idea. It lengthens out a long school day, can make students feel left out, and can mess with a student's schedule. It doesn't seem fair for the school to control a student's out of school time. While school is important, it shouldn't be a student's entire life, they need breaks from it. Clubs, activities, and sports are balanced because people who want to be in them join them, not because they have to. Other people can suffer from a student not participating in their activity making it not enjoyable for others. The school shouldn't choose a student's out of school life.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
BC5897273E24,"Why Everyone Should Have to do an Extracurricular Activity

Have you ever thought of something that you might want to do outside of school, but you never got around to it? Well this new idea might help you and I will explain why this should become a rule. I think that everyone should have to do an extracurricular activity outside of school. There are plenty of reasons for this, starting with meeting new people. You could meet a whole different friend group than you are used to and really bond with them. Also, it could get your mind off something, whether it is fighting at home or being bullied at school. If you do a sport, it could help your body too. Maybe you're not happy with your appearance, weight, or strength, sports help them all. Maybe in your activity, you could help someone who is going through a tough time with family or bad grades or anything bad going on in their life. Lastly, you could learn new things like a new sport, a certain type of art, or even discover a new talent you never new you had.

First off, doing an extracurricular activity helps in so many ways starting out with meeting new people. If you can go into someplace new and make a couple of friends, then you can be able to find a safe place with the new group so you don't have to feel like theres only a handful of people you can go to for advice or help or even just have a good time. Also, making new friends that you've never met before shows that you can work well with almost anyone and not just that handful of people.

Next, it could help get your mind off something that is just not falling into place right now. Maybe you're not getting along with your parents, or a loved one died, or maybe you're even getting bullied at school. When doing an extracurricular activity, all of your fears and sorrows just drift away like you don't have a worry in the world and you can just be yourself. Sports can definitely help with this, because when you are running up and down the court and hitting a baseball as far as you can, all of the stress in your body gets let out and you feel free. This ties in with making new friends too, because your new friends can help you get your mind off that one thing that keeps bothering you.

Especially sports help with this reason, because they help improve your entire body making you feel like a whole new you. Maybe your weight is a little above what you want it to be or your arms are too weak to lift a chair. Either way sports can help with this significantly. When you run up and down the court, it gets your blood flowing and moving at a higher speed helps you loose weight. In baseball, half of the game is throwing a ball, and in order to be able to throw it hard, you have to have arm strength. This should motivate you to work to make your arm stronger by lifting weights and doing band exercises. Also, playing a sport and making your body stronger will help make your bones strong so that if you fall on an arm lets say, its less likely to break and if it does, then it won't be severe.

Relating to where I talked about the activity or a friend helping get your mind off something, you could also help someone else if they are in the same shoes as you. Maybe they are having even worse than you which might seem impossible, but it is a reality for so many people. The least you can do to help them, is be a friend to them even if they are not your first choice. Maybe the reason they are doing the activity is to find some help from someone like you. You never know what could be going on in someones life, so be that good teammate that passes the ball to them and show them how to draw something they didn't know how to.

Last but not least, you could learn something about yourself or how to do something you never knew how to but always wanted to learn. I've always been a baseball and basketball player but maybe if we had to choose a new activity to do, then I could choose another sport like soccer or tennis. Maybe even, I could branch out and try something that's not a sport like art or possibly learn something that I could do that I never knew I could, like play guitar. That would be the beauty of the new rule, learning something new about yourself that could last you a lifetime and maybe even make you some money one day.

Yes, these after school activities can take up a lot of your free time, but when you are doing/playing them, it should be so fun that it feels like it is your free time. But if you can come out of an activity with at least one new friend and some peace of mind it should all be worth the time. Myself, I have done many extracurricular activities in my life which include mission trips with church, boy scouts, sports, and many others. For instance, the past two years my mom and I have gone with the church to a mission trip in St. Lucia. This has probably been the most special activity to me, because we got to work with kids from the age of four, all the way through the age of fourteen. The St. Lucia trips were so special to my mom and I, that we are going to Slovakia this Summer to teach the kids and teenagers English. Also I never knew that I was good at basketball until about six years ago I joined a league and started playing and quickly realized that this was something that I'm good at and want to do the rest of my life. I started playing baseball when I was four. My mom signed me up for tee ball and I had so much fun that I wanted to play again. So I kept on playing and again, I realized that I was actually pretty good. Growing up baseball has been a key to my success and I have now played on many different travel ball teams and hopefully the middle school team this year. That would be a dream come true because I have worked my whole life for that. This goes to show how much joining an extracurricular activity can do for you. I will do everything in my power to help this rule that the principle has proposed to make this an actual rule so that kids at our school and others can enjoy ourselves.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
8A0F7E327BC5,"I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity so they can experience social skills, learn to be independent, and have the opportunity to learn new things. Students should come to school and want to learn, want to go to class and do fun things. Having the chance to be involved on an extracurricular activity can bring students excitement and joy. School should not only be a place to learn but have fun times as well. There are many things a student can do at school and have good social skills, be independent, and learn new things.

Everybody learns social skills at some point. Some may be a natural, or some may struggle a bit. Extracurricular can help some students learn that it's OK to talk. Going to that extra class can let them know it's OK to come out of your comfort zone and it's not scary once you get used to it. Social skills are important, and having the opportunity to bring it up is amazing.

Having independence as a kid can be tough. We all rely on our parents to do it all for us. Well thats another reason I think every student should do at least one exreacurriculum. It gives students the chance to make their own decisions without anyone telling them otherwise. Independence is important just like food is important for our health.

It's hard to learn new things, especially when you dont like change. Although it may be hard, it's good for them in many ways. Having students participate in an extra curriculum can benefit their knowledge on something they may not know much about.

Not only will it benefit their knowledge but their skills as well. Learning new things is important, for many reasons such as having the ability to know more, or even learn a new skill you never thought you could learn.

In conclusion, schools should make the diction that all students should at least participate in at least one extra curriculum during school. Not only will it benefit them in multiple ways but teach them things such as social skills, independence, and the ability to learn new things.                ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
85B700BA5A7C,"Would you like it if your school principal would force you to do an extracurricular activity even though you dont want to. Im sure most students wouldnt mind staying after for an extracurricular activity, but for some students it could bother them, or could mess up how they are during classes because they haven't done their homeowrk because they weren't home to do it, or sometimes maybe at home because some students have to be home with their little siblings or helping their parrents at home ,and sometimes they can't becuase they are a school doing an activity.

Would you be upset if you have to stay for an extra activity? I certenly would be upset, and heres why. If my principal made me stay after school for an extra activity I would be upset beacuse I have to go home and take care of my little brother and little cousin. Also I have to help my mom around the house and if I stay after I can't help as much because i will be late and i will be at school do activitys at school, and im sure im not the only person that has to deal with that, and it can be very hard to work on both things at the same time.

If I were to stay afterschool to do activitys I feel like it would mess me up in some classes because i need to be doing homework or staying afterschool for a class, but if we don't have the extra activity I think we will be fine in our classes and our grades will be good. Another problem is that a lot of kids will be staying after school, and it could stress teachers out and might not want to help to stay afterschool.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
ACBB0618CF1A,"Do you you think that students should be required to take at least one extracurricular activity.

I think they should because it can help them stay healthy, students could make more friends that are interested in the same activity, students can set goals for them selves that are for their activity, and it can give them something to look forward to because they should be able to choose their activity.

Being healthy is important because in order for students to do their best they need to be healthy. And giving students the choices of sports helps them stay in shape and healthy. Keeping students involved with sports keeps them active and the more sports they play the more active they are.

Keeping the student in sports keeps them healthy and that helps them do their best .

If a student is in a club there will be more students in the club with the same interests and it will be easy for them to make friends.

Making friends in the same groups of interests is good because they will have a lot to talk about.

And being social is important because having a good social life will make you be happier.

And students need to learn about how to deal with social situations.

It will help students learn to set and achieve goals.

If a student is on a sports team they will have to set goals for them selves and achieve them . Because if their grades are not good enough they could be kicked off the team.

so for the students keeping their grades will be a goal they need to set and achieve.

I think it is a great idea for students to have to participate in extracurricular activities.

Because keeping yourself busy is allways better then being bored .and giving students activitys to look foward to is a great thing.

so if giving students extracurricular activites will keep students healthy, help them make friends, and learn how to set and acheve goals i think its a great idea.        ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
FEEDB5B924F3,"Do you know how your parents tell you it's for the best? Maybe the principal is doing the same, by making you do at least one extracurricular activity. This idea keeps you and some of your classmates out of trouble, also it helps you meet new people, and you can find something that interests you.

First, this keeps you and some of your classmates out of trouble. When there at an extracurricular activity there somewhere good instead of somewhere bad. Like in the movie Brian Banks, if he was at football practice instead of with the girl he would've never went to jail. The people your hanging around in your activity are going to be good people, so you don't get drawn into the badness. Instead of going to detention your in your activity so you keep out of trouble.

Next, you get to meet new people. If you're shy than this is an opportunity for you to make new friends. You can also meet somebody that is good in a class that you're not good in. For example, say that you're having trouble with writing and you you meet somebody that has an A in writing, you can ask them for help so you can have an A in writing also.

Finally, you can find something you may be interested in. If you go into an activity that you've never done before you might come out of it wanting to come back to it the next day. Also, you may find a job that you're interested in related to the activity you did. For instance, if you do pictures for the yearbook then when you got older you might want to be a photographer.

In conclusion, the idea for everyone to participate in a extracurricular activity is a good idea. It keeps you and some of your classmates out of trouble, you get to meet new people, and it helps you find something you're interested in.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

1681878C051A,"Every student must at least complete one extracurricular activity each year. When students participate in extracurricular activities like sports, working on the year book and serving the student council. Every student must do these's activities every year. Doing these activities will help out the school and your self. These activities will help you, making you get out and talk to people that you dont know, completing these activities each year will make you more active.

Doing sports is a very good way to keep you healthy you are also completing one of the activities that the principal . Every sport makes you move,

Examples walking, running and swimming. When you move your exercising and when you exercise you burn calorie. Sports also make you work together with other people you may not know very well, and it can be a very important skill that you will need in the future of your life. Playing sports is very healthy for you because you interact with people and you gain muscle.

When your trying to help make the year book everyone in the school is going to benefit from your actions. Working on the year book is a good way get you off games and be more productive. Also you will work with other people which can help you learn a skill about teamwork and how faster and productive then working alone. When you work on the yearbook it takes a lot of time out of your day, however you are being very productive through out the day instead of playing games and messing around. completing this project will help a lot of people out by working on the year.

Completing these activities made you a more healthy person and a more skillful person also, working on these activities made you a better person in every single way. when you working on these activities you developed many skills like working with other people and not letting go of project. When playing sports you learned how to work together. A reason why the principal wanted everyone to work on a extracurricular is because you learn many skills from the tasks that you do. You had to work your way through the challenge.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
39AAD2CA2F1F,"The, middle school, softball player runs off of third base and sprints to home plate. She is joined by her teammates who help her celebrate her accomplishment-scoring a home run. Having students participate in an extracurricular activity after school, or during, is a statement I agree with. With the principal deciding to make extracurricular activities a must, students will boost their self-esteem, gain school spirit, and learn lessons not found on the school's curriculum.

Five out of ten students, from middle school to high school, were reported to have low self-esteem. The lack of having friends, self-respect, and confidence, has been viewed as the culprit. By joining a school sport or club, students are welcomed to the experience of being on a team. While on a team, a student can find many helpful resources: teammates as friends, confidence gained from new abilities, and even self-respect for being adaptable to new experiences. The students can take what they found through being on a team, or working with others, and find a new perspective to life; a life without shunning their self worth. Extracurricular activities do not only help improve student's self-esteem, for their school spirit is also strengthened.

For the last couple of years, school spirit has been a dimming candle. With school activities and student participation, the candle of school spirit can be brightened again. When students participate in clubs or school sports, they are representing their school as a whole. They learn that working as a team, and together, they can build their school's name into a invincible structure. Students will gain school spirit through related activities, thus helping them gain respect for their school. School spirit can be built through numerous extracurricular events, just like how students can learn lessons from them.

A student learns many valuable lessons, everyday, through their school's curriculum. Unfortunately, their school's curriculum cannot teach them the lessons found in school activities: teamwork, school spirit, or even adaptability. Students need to be exposed to more than what their teacher writes on the board; they need to be exposed to real life or constructive lessons, one that builds their characteristics. Unlike many personal views, some school enthusiasts say that certain school activities teach an unhealthy competitiveness that should not be unearthed. However, life provokes a competitiveness; for instance, students will have to be competitive while applying for a job, or when operating a competitive business. Life is competitive, and being exposed to that planted seed is a beneficial lesson. Extracurricular activities teach students lessons that stretch what they have learned while sitting at a desk.

Boosting self-esteem, gaining school spirit, and learning lessons not taught in a classroom, are all effects a student will undergo, because of the principal's decision to make school activities a must. A student will benefit more and more from the addition of extracurricular activities. They will gain more confidence in themselves, learn how to represent their school through school spirit, and plant a competitive seed. I agree with the principal's decision to add school related activities to his list of must haves. Now the school's spirit will not dim, with the help of the student's participation.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
25325F09BF85,"I disagree that all students should take extracurricular activity's.

if a students take these extra activity's, If a kid dosn't want to do it then don't force them to, if a kid is doing a sport out side of school they should not have to do a sport in school and make them quit there sport that they are already doing one, it could over work the students.

If a student dosn't want to do the extracurricular activity's then why do you have to force them to do it. If you force the student to do it then they wont try if they don't like the thing there doing and fail. students should have the ability to chose whether or not to chose a extracurricular activity because if they dont want to do it they dont have to.

If a student is doing a sport out side of school than they should be able to chose whether they quit the sport there doing out side of school or be over worked with doing a sport in side and out side of school. if you have two sports it could over whelm students. students will give up or not try as hard in in school activities than out of school activates.

All of the thing student do in school is probably enoph but adding another thing could over work students or make them stressed out about all of the thing that they are doing. and as I said earlier student will give up and no try because they hate doing it.

CDC9899690AE,"It is the beginning of the new school year, and your in class the principal makes an anccoument you have to join a extracurricular activity. I agree with what the principal says because. You can make new friends and bonds, explore something new, and have a happier life.

Make new friends everyone says it is easy. For me it is not to hard but for others it is a challenge. That is why doing an activity after school is really helpful for people to make friends. All the friends I have are from after school activities. For example I had a sleepover with kids on my lacrosse team a day ago. I would have never known them unless I tried something new after school. That is why you should find something that you enjoy because kids in there will share a common interest in that club. Then you can get to know each other and bond over that common interest. Like my lacrosse story I was more of a football guy until I was convinced to play. Now I have great friendships and great support, and I am enjoying every minute of it. If you think you can't make friends or it is to hard or you want to be alone. Just try a club, sport, and other great choices trust me it will work out. No one deserves to be alone now you go get yourself a friend and do a extracurricular activity.

Exploring new things now that is hard. Exploring new things can be nerve racking and make you anxious. Exploring something new is great and it will help you keep an open mind. Doing anything new is pretty bad at first you feel sick you just want to keep doing what your doing. You just want to stay in your comfort zone stick with what your doing, but sometimes you need to escape it and explore. Exploring new things is a little bit unsettling. Just like an extracurricular try something new and you might just become your favorite thing. Seeing and doing things that are new to you is amazing. It might spark interest, it can help you make friends, and teach you to try do more new things. If you try something new to you and you like it that activity or hobby can turn into a chain reaction. Of you trying things new and who wants to live a life of the same thing you can live a little find something new. Just go in headfirst what is life without a little risk without risk your life is the definition of boredom. If you ever think about doing something new or it sparks interest go for it.

A happy life lots of people have their own definition of a happy life. Well how does being with a group of people or a team that share something in common, and no one is left out sound. Extracurricular activity like a football team if you are on it the other players share a passion for the game. That is happiness like a second family that is my lacrosse team we have created that bond. You can to if you chose something new and your are passionate about it. You will find those people and being with those people pretty much everyday. Creating that special bond will make your life 10000 times better you will have that sense of belonging somewhere. Where you are comfortable around people and you can be yourself around that second family. You can take off that mask off ,and stop being someone you pretend to be and rip it off and be yourself. You join a group maybe the first won't work but I promise you will find that sense of belonging somewhere else besides home. You will have that sense of happiness true happiness once you reach that there is no anything much better that that I promise.

Just maybe you still don't like this idea of extracurricular activities and you just want to stay by yourself and fly under the radar. that is fine it is your choice but if you kept and open mind and tried it. You will make new friends and new bonds, explore and do something new, and live a true happy life. If you are going to high school or you are in high school and you do not do anything after school. Just try it find something you like and do it if it does not work out then you can go back to your confront zone. Life needs a little risk and that risk is you joining an after school extracurricular activity.    ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
76056531D3D9,"Many students have been either forced or pressured to do an extracurricular activity. They might be forced or pressured by a parent/guardian, teacher, or friend. However, that doesn't mean they should do the activity. The principal should not force students to participate in an extracurricular activity because, students might not have time to do an activity, might be forced to do an activity they don't like, or the activities might suffer.

While some students have plenty of extra time to use after school, some may not. Students can usually get their homework done either after school or during resource. Though, they don't always do it in a healthy way. Some have to stay up late to get an assignment done either because, they forgot when it was due, waited till the last minute to do it, didn't realize how big it was, or have a field trip or special event they are going to. This causes the student to not get a healthy amount of sleep, which causes them to have trouble paying attention in class. Also some students decide to take all honors classes, which usually give out more homework than normal classes. If the student has to deal with an after school activity on top of all of this, then they will have a very annoying schedule.

Sometimes parents force their kid to do an extracurricular activity. Usually the student either finds out that they enjoy the activity, or that they hate it. If they hate it they could ask their parents if they can stop doing the activity, but the parent could say no. Then the kid is stuck doing this activity even though they don't want to do it. The same problem can happen if a friend asks them to do an extracurricular activity with them. The kid might find out that they don't like the activity, but they don't want to upset their friend, so they continue to do the activity. If the principal says the students have to take an extracurricular activity, a few of the students might not want to do any of the possible activities. This would would mean at least a few students would be forced to do an activity they don't enjoy. If students are forced to take an extracurricular activity, then they could get stuck doing something they don't want to do.

There are hundreds of kids in a school. If the principal were to say that every student in the school has to do at least one extracurricular activity, it would be a mess. The after school activities that the school offers would be overflowing with students. If the school had only one team for each sport, the school would need to make a lot more. If more teams are made more equipment will be needed, which means the school would have to use more money. Also the teams themselves would suffer, because there are bound to be kids who don't even like the sport who are only there because they have to be. This could also happen with almost any other activity in the school. If students are forced to take an extracurricular activity, the activities will suffer.

If students are forced to participate in an extracurricular activity, students won't have enough time to do assignments, might be forced to do an activity they dislike, and the activities the school offers will suffer. Though it may seem like a good idea to have all the students do an extracurricular activity, it will be a pain for the students and the school.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
DFBA34FFE11D,"Should students participate in an extracurricular activity? It may seem like a simple question, but there are actually many different answers to this question. Personally, I think that each student can benefit from joining in on an extracurricular. These may include clubs such as Soccer Club or Harry Potter Club, or maybe something like the school newspaper and Student Council. Each of these can provide a positive impact for every person who joins. I think that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they can help kids make and create new friendships, urge someone to develop a new skill, and encourage students to go outside of their comfort zone.

One way an extracurricular activity can benefit a student is by helping them to create new friendships, or maybe become closer with someone they normally wouldn't. For example, I have a friend who is a member of the Nintendo Club at our school. She is the only girl in the club, yet she has made new and unexpected friends through this experience. There are many different types of people who come together for these activities, so when a person joins in they can meet someone who has the same interests and hobbies. Unexpected friendships can be born through the simple action of attending an extracurricular.

A second positive outcome to participating in an extracurricular is the chance to develop a new skill. Another friend of mine loved to draw and write, but wasn't really a fan of sports. Recently, he decided to attend the Basketball Club and ended up loving it! He has continued to go to Basketball Club, and his skills have increased greatly. Although it may take some time, one can eventually develop a new and fun skill which they normally wouldn't have. Additionally, if someone has multiple skills and talents, that can increase their self esteem. A lot of students have insecurities and worry about not fitting in, however, when they gain a new skill this can boost the way they see themselves and increase their confidence.

The last way a student can benefit from participating in an extracurricular is by encouraging them to step outside of their comfort zone. I think that going outside of your comfort zone is something most people are not comfortable with doing, including myself. Over the summer, my brother switched soccer teams and this was very hard for him. Between having to leave his old team behind and adjusting to the new atmosphere, this new change was very difficult for him. As time went on, and he kept pushing himself outside of his comfort zone, and he had acclimated and adapted to the new environment. Now, my brother is so happy that he decided to go beyond what he was used to and loves his team. Even though this situation wasn't about an extracurricular, they are both related. When a student joins a new club, they may be very nervous. But when someone makes the decision to try something new and take that scary step outside of their comfort zone, there will be many rewards in return. One of which is when people try new things, it can lead them to be successful in the future and inspire others to do the same thing.

To conclude, there are multiple benefits for a person who makes the choice to participate in an extracurricular. These include the chance to make new friends and meet new people, help students to develop a new skill, and urge someone to take a risk and go outside of their comfort zone. Although some may not want to try an extracurricular, it can impact them in so many positive ways. Should students participate in an extracurricular? I think yes, and if someone takes a risk and joins in on one, they might just think yes as well.    ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
DEECF8A86136,"Extracurricular activities, you love them or you hate them. I love them and think that everyone should do them, but just because I think students should do extracurricular activities does not mean that I think people have to do them. My principle wants to make every student in the school to do some sort of extracurricular activity. I believe that students should not be forced into doing an extracurricular activities. I think this because they will not might have as much fun as they would on their own terms, students might have other more important things to do, and because the school shouldn't control outside your curricular life.

I think that students should not have to do extracurricular activities because they would not have as much fun as the normally would. As a teen I know that most people my age like space and freedom. I think that even if there is an activity that students like, they will like it more if they join of their own free will. I also think that some students might not like any of the extracurricular activities in the area and prefer to read books or watch movies by themselves.

Another reason students should not be forced into doing extracurricular activities is because they might have more important things to do. Imagine with me for a second. Pretend that you are a student and you have a very big test tomorrow and you need to study. Unfortunately, you cannot study because you are forced to go to an activity. It is things like this that are the problem, if students have family visiting or something else important going on, they will not be able to show up because they are forced to go to a sport or to an art club.

The Final reason I think that Students should not have to do an extracurricular activity is because the school shouldn't control outside of your curricular life. The school already takes up plenty of your time. Students go to school for five days a week and roughly between six and seven hours a day with a couple exceptions. We devote plenty of time to school and the school should not take up anymore of a students time. Students Should use their own time however they want without being forced to do an activity. If someone really wanted to do an extracurricular activity that bad, they wouldn't need to be forced into doing it.

In conclusion, I believe that students should not be forced into doing extra curricular activities because they would have more fun doing it on their own, they might have more important things to do, school shouldn't control outside of your curricular life, and if someone really wanted to do a activity they would not need to be forced into it. Students should do what they want to do, whether that be staying home or going to an extracurricular activity. Besides, if the school doesn't force students to do activities, their parents probably will.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
DCC03D6E1A60,"Disagree, There are many reasons that we many not be able to go and do extracurricular activities we could not have the time and they should respect that because we have lives to and so do our parent which is another reason. Our parents may have to go to work and the only time they can pick us up is at the end of the school day or our family can only pick us up at that time. another reason is medical problems or other forms of illness. A big reason is religions we could only be able to do specific thing. may we are not be able to stay so long but a lot of religions have to go to some form of temple or church to pray at a specific time.

There are some people who just dont like do extracurricular activities and have problems doing them. a lot of people need extra help with other things and making extracurricular activities mandatory is a real big struggle for them and just makes school harder. there are plenty of people dont want to, cant or struggle with them and that's not fair to make them mandatory. Why make things harder for a big group of people just so they will do extracurricular activities. there are students who like them so make them optional.

Their are ways to get around the struggle of making them mandatory by making them optional or asking our teachers if we are ready for them. We will probably do better knowing that we are being treated like an adult by giving us more freedom and more choices on there education. Why are you guys holding back on giving us educational freedom like the choice on if we do extracurricular activities. Why are you not giving us the choice on if we do extracurricular activities I can not tell you for shore but I think they dont trust the us to challenge our self to help our self to get better but I think we are capable and we want to and will If given the chance to.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
67A24E5541AF,"From playing an instrument to battling in a game, from sports to journalistic and fantastical writing, there are so many options of extracurricular activities. These clubs and teams can improve both the mental and physical health of students, affecting their daily lives positively and giving them another group of friends. A new rule that students must participate in at least one activity is an incredible opportunity to grow.

Having a place to relax and have fun in school can often be a struggle for students. While doing an extracurricular activity, students can release stress and have fun doing something they love. In a club or team, students form a sort of ""family."" They all share a passion or interest in the subject and get to know people they would not otherwise have met. Throughout the school day, students can build up confusion, worry or anger about projects and friendships. This gives them an opportunity to have fun doing something they enjoy.

While these activities can simply be enjoyable, it also can improve health and affect students' day to day lives. Sports can keep students physically active and engaged. It has been scientifically proven that physical activity can improve a person's happiness and reduce stress, although this also applies to any activity that is enjoyed by the student. While participating in a club, students can ignore other thoughts and focus only on what is at hand. This is exactly what students tend to need after a long day of school.

With an outlet for energy and anxiety, students can focus better on their schoolwork and can also get the help they may need from their friends.

Many people worry about participating in these activities, believing that students will not have enough time to focus on their studies. However, many of the students that already to extracurricular activities are active in multiple clubs. These students still manage to get their work done. Also, as this rule of participation would be school wide, teachers would likely lighten how much homework they give out. Finally, this prepares students for the future. They will have to learn to lead balanced lives as adults, so this will give them the opportunity to learn how to work efficiently and still have downtime.

All together, having an activity outside of school is a good idea for students as it improves health and grades and gives opportunities to have new friends. Enforcing this policy would be an interesting change and would lead to a happier and more efficient school environment. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
0184ED9B19B9,"Imagine you are sitting on the bench as your team walks off of the field, their head's hanging low while the opposing team rushes to their star player hoisting the trophy up high. Picture yourself watching the head editor of the yearbook staff delete the layout and images that you spent hours perfecting, the votes for student council president being announced and seeing your name down at the very bottom with only a few votes. As much as administrators, coaches, teachers, and parents will tell kids over and over that extracurricular activities are an amazing experience, that is not always the case. Sometimes they are the root of not just physical pain, but emotional pain as well. An extracurricular activity is a personal choice that is extremely dependent on what goes on behind closed doors in a student's life. Requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity would not be beneficial to every student because it could interfere with family commitments, possibly exclude and limit kids who are struggling in school or those with special needs and disabilities, and create an overly competitive and hostile environment.

Many families, especially those with financial troubles, rely on their children to take care of each other and the family as a whole. Requiring a student to participate in a very time-consuming activity on top of their pre-existing commitments to the welfare of their parents and siblings, in addition to homework can seriously damage their living conditions. In many cases the oldest child may have to pick up the younger siblings from school and watch them to ensure their well being. If you take away this student who is already taking on parental responsibilities, you could unintentionally cause a domino effect leading to the injury of a young child. When a family is struggling financially and one of their children is of working age, it is not uncommon for the teenager to begin working to try and gain more financial stability for their parents. Jobs and extracurricular activities are both very laborious and time consuming. This combination of responsibilities and time commitments would not work whatsoever, leading the student to have to make a choice that they don't have in attempting to decide between supporting their family's income and a sports team. Almost every child growing up had chores. I know I do, and a lot of them at that. From cooking dinner when parents are working late, to taking out the trash, to cleaning up after younger siblings spill something, there is an endless list of chores in a child's daily life. The homework that is already assigned can sometimes make a student spend an entire night only focusing on the piles of worksheets and reading that they have to do. In many cases, this cramming of homework can result in the incompletion of chores, much less having two hours of sports or yearbook after school as well. Adding even more time commitments onto the already packed schedule of a middle or high schooler is undoubtedly going to have severe consequences on family life.

By nature, extracurricular activities are competitive. Whether it's for a spot on the starting sports team, or one of the top editors in the yearbook, or the lead in the musical, or even the student council president, these are all competitions that extracurricular activities promote. These competitions may lead to a hostile environment inside the classroom or in the halls. Students can often go too far in competition, with both verbal and physical fights breaking out over some of the most trivial things. If we already have problems with hostility and people not understanding when they have taken something too far, how can we stop them from continuing this while essentially fanning the flame?

There is an extracurricular activity for everyone that can benefit them as well as leave them with good study habits, right? For students with learning disabilities and special needs, an extracurricular activity could become a nightmare in reality. Not only could physical disabilities impede a student's ability to play the sport that they want, but learning disabilities like dyslexia and ADHD can affect the student's ability to participate in some of the simpler stationary activities. If you look at the grade percentages in many schools, you can see that there is a large population of students that are seriously struggling in one or more classes, even with teacher's help after school. Studying for an upcoming test can be an hours long endeavor. Requiring a student to add a few more hours of extracurricular activities is ridiculous and can only have negative effects. Teachers are constantly preaching the importance of reviewing your materials every night and how you must complete all of your homework assignments in addition to unfinished classwork, but how can you do this if you barely even have time to sit down for dinner?

If we require students to participate in extracurricular activities, we are setting up multiple major issues like lack of time for family commitments, unintentionally putting students with special needs and learning disabilities at a disadvantage, and creating an overly competitive environment. While extracurricular activities can have benefits such as social skills and a healthier body, the risks associated with it outweigh the possibility of benefits for a smaller portion of the student body. We need to consider the effect on the smaller groups of people that are being put at a disadvantage before we make decisions with only a possibility of benefits. If we leave extracurricular activities as an optional choice, we eliminate the greater risk of social and mental health issues, exclusion of many different groups of people, physical fights, bullying, harassment, familial disarray, and many others.  ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
BBB54BC8F12C,"Other than class work, I'm sure all students wish they could be doing something better in school. Such as playing soccer, or taking pictures for the schools yearbook. All students should do at least 1 extracurricular activity. It keeps them occupied, it's fun for students, and it can benefit the teachers too.

Doing an activity can take up any unused time in a students break after school. All extracurricular activities keep students occupied. Instead of sitting around on your phone after school, you could be playing outside doing sports with your peers.

Another reason students should do extracurricular activities is because it's fun! You get to choose any activity that'd fit your likings and hobbies. Maybe sports aren't your thing, so you could take a photography club or become a part of the student council. You could also become a part of a club that just plays board games all day. There's something out there for everyone.

Lastly, extracurricular activities can give a helping hand to teachers and administrators. Any type of volunteering could help out different people in your school. Working on the yearbook would be a big help to whoever's in charge of editing it and taking all the photos. And if there's time taken off of class for clubs then some teachers have extra time to get their own work done, so everyone wins.

To conclude this, I hope reading this made you believe that all students should participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity in school or after school. It keeps them occupied, it can be fun for the students, and it gives the teachers a helping hand.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

The issue with extracurricular activities

Should all students participate in at least one extra curricular activity? No, the principal's new rule that makes students participate in at least one extra curricular activity is ridiculous. First of all, for many students it is not in their budget to stay after school, they just can not afford it. Second is, a lot of students have responsibilities or struggles at home they have to take care of, and can not simply stay after school, even if it is just for an hour. The principle should rethink his decisions and not make this a rule at our school.

Many students at our school aren't as fortunate as others, and struggle to make ends meet. Their only rides to and from school could be the school bus because their families don't have a good car, so they would have to go through finding someone else to drive them, which can be very difficult sometimes. For the kids whose families do have cars, that could mean that their parents have to take time of of work to pick up and drive home their kids. The more time their parents have to take off work to pick up them from clubs and sports, the less money they could have the opportunity to make for their family.

Some students attending our school have things that are out of their control that they need to get done right after school, like homework. Other students have family struggles outside of school, such as their parents being split up and then having to rely on only one parent to take care of them at that specific time. When a student only has one parent taking care of them at a specific time, they may not have a choice but to go home after school on the bus because the parent taking care of them has be at work at that time. Some students may also have a lot of homework that they can not get done if they go to a club or sport after school. The principal did not make it clear about if club sports counted as an extracurricular activities. Many students participate in club sports, and if they are made to stay after school in a school club, they could miss a practice or game. Students might also have a long list of chores to do when they get home and a club could get in the way of that.

So should students be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity? No, they should be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity. If they get forced to participate in an extracurricular activity their normal, everyday lives could be disrupted, and some students just can not do a club or sport at all due to things happening at home. If we put this rule into place, the school would quickly turn into a disaster of confused and upset kids.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
0CA6C4864708,"Do you like participating in extracurricular activity because I don't? I disagree with my principals decision of making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. There are a few reasons I don't like participating in school activates and I can name a few of those reasons. One reason is that I want to spend time with my family instead of doing school activities, another reason is that i can tend to be shy, and I'm really lazy.

I like spending time with my family. Me and my family will sometimes go to Generic_City, or even just to the park. If I participated in school activities me and my family wouldn't be able to go places. I really enjoy spending time with my family because I dont get to see them much during the week so on the weekends we will go somewhere to do something. It could be something little or it could be something big I love my family and if I were to participate in school activities we would have games on the weekend preventing me from spending time with my family.

Another reason I don't like school activities is because I'm very shy and just act weird during events. If I wasn't so shy I would participate in school activities. Due to being shy prevents me from making friends and when you make friends it can make the activity more funner than it already is. Shy can also be a good thing at times during schools activities because you won't be spotted out as much as the more talkative kids. So yeah I'm a very shy person but being shy can sometimes be a good thing.

My last topic about not liking to participate in school activity is that I'm very lazy. I usually during the week after school go home watch a little bit of T.V and then do my laundry and then sit there and do nothing.

I hate having to do something especially on the weekends after a long week of school I just want to lay down and do nothing. Every once in awhile I'll go outside and shoot some basketball but other than that I dont do anything. So I'm a very lazy person and don't want to do many things around the house.

In conclusion I disagree with my principals decision of making all students at least participate in one school activity. I like spending time with my family. I am very shy and don't like to participate for that reason. I'm lazy and don't do anything but do laundry and shoot basketball. So yeah I disagree with the principal decision of at least all students participate in a extracurricular activity. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
C32244E43789,"Dear,Mr. Principal

Mr. Princical I do not agre with your decition to make all students do a extracurricular activitys and I am going to give you a few reasons why I personaly think so I would apreaciate if you reconsider after you read my reasons.

First Some students do Sports or other activities out of school like Hockey, Foot Ball, or even Boy Scouts for a local team or troop. And adding a extracurricular activity and homework it would be kaous, and dont even get me started on how exzosted students would be. For example My oldest sister, Lindsay who did more than one Extracurricular Acitivitys like Chearleading, Swim, and Archery had her grades go down which leades me to my second reason Grades.

Some students such as my self have end up not doing very well in school when we do a extracurruclar acitivity and a second one outside of school such as the ones I did Foot Ball, Archery, and Boy Scouts which is very hard to do when you add homework to it and you want to do good at the sports that you do aswell trust me it is very hard.

Next reason I have is what if you are injured or disabaled and don't plan on doing year book after doing a difrent acitivity earlearer in the year with all the frends that you had made while doing the acitivity with them and yet you would have to leave them just because you had broken a bone or sprained your arm or leg because you would have to do an Extracurricular Acitivity because that is the school rule.

So bacicley what I am trying to say is that it might not be the best idea to make every student do a extra curicular acitivity due to all the reasonsi have and the many reasons that my fellow students have as well so i would apreaciate it if you would re consider",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

F19B178A98C7,"Yes I agree,Beacause I feel like students have to participate in at least one exrtacurricular activity because they can get a grade on participating. And that's really easy to do and another reason for students to participate is that students can avoide getting in trouble and go to the office and talk to the principal or go to RC.And i don't think they want to talk the principal for not participating and you only have to participate in one thing not all of the things like it can be sports,yearbook,ag,etc. Because if I we're them i would participate in an exracurricular activity that they like ore and then they don't have to worry about getting in trouble,going to the office,talking to the principal,or even goin to RC.Like they one got to do one activity it's not that hard at all and i like sports so i would an activity of sports and that's it then i would be doneand not have to worry about getting in trouble or even getting a bad grade if they even grade us but if they did i would get a good grade just for participating.

EE3A09C24124,"If a school has a rule where the students have to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities; it could be beneficial for the students but at the same time it will depend on the students and how they want to spend their time. Also it could prove defective if the students feel too much pressure do to school work and the requirements needed for their specific activity. All in all it could also hurt the students sleep schedule and performance making them come in tired, with muscle cramps, fatigue etc.

In any case asking students to participate in extracurricular activities could help not just the students but also the school; if the students win first place in tournaments or championships the reward(s) from these events could prove useful not just to students but the school as well. It could also help the students by teaching them the value of others how to coordinate as a team along side with team building, public speaking, problem solving, and other helpful skills. Overall it could be a good strategy to teach students of all ages how to work together; combining all age groups could enhance students leadership skills.

although students could have positive impacts by this decision it could also have negative impacts; such as reducing students sleep time with homework they couldn't do because they were at practice. A lot of things could happen if a change like this came out of nowhere like students grades would go down they would pay less attention; students would be overwhelmed by the school work they have to complete and the time they have to separate for their extracurricular activity. After the students would come the school putting all employees out of work and leaving students uneducated. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

D15873549B60,"Sports, working on a year book, and serve on the student council are great extracurricular activities. I don't agree with all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some students have to take care of their younger brothers and sisters because kids don't know how to take of themselves. For example, you leave a kid alone for one day he/she will cry, pout, and scream because he/she are scared, alone, and frighten. Kids are still young and clueless. Some students also may have already participated in other activities outside of school, like hockey, football, and many more. I do not think they would want to participate in a school activity because it's a waste their of time and they are already doing an activity outside of school. Students also need to get some rest and sleep not doing an school activity almost everyday. For example, I would hate doing an school activity almost everyday because most of the time I'm lazy and all I want to do is relax and sleep. These days students are lazy and addicted to social media because life is boring and barley fun. Students have other problems to work out at home, like family problems, personal problems, and sickness problems. Some of them would probably not attend school activities or school.

0A373C01EAD7,"I believe students shouldn't have to participate in any extracurricular activity. Here is why I disagree, some students have to go home and take care of a sibling or grandparent, a student may have had a bad day or they might not have time to stay for the activity, and many students already stress enough with school. So why make it worse?

One reason why it shouldn't be necessary is, many students have to take care of their sibling or grandparent. For example, a student might have to go home and make food for a younger sibling because their parents are working and it is their job to care for them. Another example is, a student may have a grandparent that lives with them that is not very mobile or they simply can't take care of themselves.

A Second reason why it shouldn't be necessary is, a student may have had a bad day at school and they probably want to go home but can't. For example, failing a test can be very hard on students sometimes because they know it might affect their grade which could instantly ruin their day. Another example is, some students don't have time because they might have a sport outside of school or they might have a family problem and need to get home once school finishes.

A Third reason why it shouldn't be necessary is, school is very stressful for us students because we are expected to learn everything very quick and to have good grades but sometimes we just need time to relax. Another example is, forcing a student to do an extracurricular activity like a sport or serving on student council can make us start dreading school more than we already do.

These are the reasons why I disagree, students shouldn't have to participate in any extracurricular activity because students have siblings or grandparents to take care of, having a bad day or having no time for after school, and school make students stress a lot. Students have responsibilities and lives out of school we can't forget that.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
68201A571AE4,"During the summer leading up to my eighth grade year, my mom suggested that I get involved in an extracurricular activity because they are very beneficial for kids.

I thought for a while, then took her advice and decided to play on my high school's junior varsity football team.

When the practices first started that July, things were running pretty smoothly;however, once the school year started a couple of weeks later, things got a quite a lot tougher.

I had to learn to be responsible in order to keep up with my homework every day after practice.

As the season went on, I learned a lot of stuff about football and school, but most importantly, I had lots of fun doing it.

I am so glad that I took my mom's advice about extracurricular activities being beneficial to kids because I found that to be true for me as well.

Consequently, I agree with the decision that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.

First, I think all students should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches students new, real world skills.

There are countless numbers of valuable techniques in the world today that are never taught within a classroom, but are needed for a successful career.

For example, when I played football, I learned the importance of working together on a team with other people.

When we all learned to work as one team, we started to play really good and win games.

On the other hand, if someone goes all throughout school and never learns the skill of teamwork, it is likely that they will not be very successful when they enter the real world because teamwork is an important skill that is needed in almost every job.

Just imagine if you are a business owner or employer and are looking for a person that you can hire to work for you.

Would you choose the person who was never involved in any type of after school or extracurricular activity, or would you choose the person who was very productive and was involved in many different activities throughout their schooling?

You would probably choose the one who was very involved in their school because that shows you that they have the skills needed to work for you and can keep up with a job.

Secondly, everyone should be involved in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them how to be responsible with their work.

Most kids today don't want to do their homework, and instead only do the fun stuff like play on their phones or lay on the couch like a sleeping bear, which usually results in bad grades.

However, being involved in an activity teaches students that if they want to have fun and stay in their club, they must do their work before anything else.

For example, during football season, I had to be extremely responsible with my schoolwork and grades, or else my coach could have kicked me off of the team.

Similarly, being responsible can also be a key characteristic of getting into college or the workforce.

Just like how you have a low chance of getting hired if you don't have the skills, you have an even lower chance of getting a job if you can't be responsible and maintain your job very well.

Some of the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the most talented or have the most skills, but they are able to keep up with all their work and maintain their position.

Lastly, extracurricular activities teach students how to have fun while doing something productive.

As mentioned earlier, students these days only like to do the fun stuff, not the work.

Extracurricular activities give kids the chance to have loads of fun, but also learn valuable lessons.

As a result of the activities being fun, students will also be more likely to stay in their club because they enjoy it, which helps both the students and the teachers get along better.

Additionally, most students will go away from a class and only remember the fun things that they did in it, while they will forget about all the important stuff.

But in extracurricular classes, the fun parts of the class will usually directly relate to profitable skills or morals, so that when students remember the fun stuff, they will also remember the skills that they learned as well.

For example, one day during football practice, our coach had us do a fun drill where we got to run behind our blockers.

I vividly remember this because it was really exciting when I got to do it, although, when I think about it, I also remember that in order to do it, I had to get low and run with the proper technique.

It was because of fun things like that drill that I was able to stick with the game and improve my skills.

So as you can see, I agree with the decision that all kids should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.

Just like how I had to alter my work schedule when I played football, extracurricular activities might not be that easy, but I can promise you that in the long run, they are worth participating in.

So even if you don't think extracurricular activities are good for you, go ahead and just give one a try.

There are all sorts of activities out there that are available to everyone, so all you need to do is find the one that strikes your fancy.

I guarantee that you will not regret it at all!",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
996C6D34FAE1,"Have you ever been forced to participate in something you didn't want to? Well, that's exactly what this principal has decided to do with all of his students. Kids are expected to do so much in twenty four hours, go to school, do homework, go to sports, eat, and manage to get at least eight hours of sleep every night. Kids have lives outside of school that no one at school really knows about. You can't predict that a student goes home after a long day at school and wishes they had something to do. Some kids barely get enough sleep every night. For these reasons I believe students shouldn't be forced to participate in extracurricular activities.

Every day students wake up and go to school for seven hours whether they like it or not. Some kids don't like it, they don't like the environment of school and all they think about is when they can go home. So why force them to stay longer, they won't be happy so no one is winning. For the students that like school, and wouldn't mind staying a couple hours later and participating, let them do it. It should be their choice. If they think it would be fun, let them do it. But, if home is the only place where these kids feel safe, let them go home. Kids deserve to go home and relax after seven hours of school five days a week.

In addition, say a student really wishes they could participate in an extracurricular, they may not have the time to. With only twenty four hours in a day kids are expected to sleep for eight hours, go to school for seven hours, participate in any sports they might have, come home and do hours of homework, eat dinner, try to spend time with family, and go to sleep at a decent hour. As if that's not enough try adding an extracurricular activity into the mix, there's not enough hours in a day. But, not everyone has that packed of a schedule so for those people that could stay after for a little and kill some time, let them. It should be their choice and their choice only. Not the principal's who has no idea what a student's life is like after the last bell rings.

In conclusion, kids have so much going on that the school doesn't know about. Some students really don't like school so why are we forcing them to stay longer than needed for something that could just make it worse. You can't expect every student to want to go to school every day let alone commit the time into staying longer and doing something ""fun"". Even if they wanted to, there may not be enough time left in the day for that to happen. Students already have enough stress as it is so why put even more on their plate if it won't help them succeed. Kids that do have the time and want to participate in these can and should be able to. Because of these reasons, I believe that students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities.     ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Kids already spend there whole day at school, why do they have to do afterchool activities?

I think that students should not have to do participate in after school activities,Because school is very challenging already. Nevertheless it will cost them time out of homework,sports,and could lead to stress . kids have there own opinion too. In general after school activities should be a responsibility not a duty.

More Stress

Most kids in our age already deal with stress. Image what would staying after school to do something you don't like to do will do to most of the kids that are stressed out. More than 63 percent of people are stressed out in my age according to studies. Afterschool would just make It worse, mostly If you dont like any of the activities that they run. Finally I really disagree with this topic,because I have stayed after before in my school and I didn't really like it,I thought it was a waster of time,cause it ended at 5 and we get out at 2:15.

Lack of time

We all know that one excuse that we all have used before it's called ""I didn't have time"". To be honest with you I think that this would be a waste of time for some people,and super crowded. Mostly everyone wouldnt really participate cause they would be complaining that this is a waste of time. Also people might not take it seriously and skip it or find a way out of after school activities. In my opinion kids should be doing what they want to do like, watch TV,play sports,hangout with friends,and much more. It could also effect teachers plans and grading time and there whole schedule.

Conclusion

In general after school activities should be a responsibility not a duty. People in my opinion dont have to be force to do stuff they dont want to do. Kids also have stuff to do outside of school just like every other person. In conclusion I think this after school decision wouldnt work out because people would find ways out of staying after school.

803FCF571644,"Are principal decided to have all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Lots of students agree with his decision and others do not feel that he is right. I agree with his decision because extracurricular activities put students farther ahead academically and teaches them life skills.

The first reason I agree with this decision is because it puts students farther ahead academically. Doing activities like sports and year book club teaches problem salving skills like thinking ahead that will help student in school. For example, if your in a football game and you decide to change your play after looking at the other teams defense you were learning to think ahead. Also, doing extracurricular activities teaches students to learn from their mistakes. For Instance, if you were part of the basket ball team you could look back on the games you lost and learn how to get better. This helps in school because you could look at a test you failed and find out what you did wrong and how you could get better.

The second reason I agree with this decision is because it teaches students life skills. One skill extracurricular activities teaches is how to work with others. For example If you were part of the year book club you would learn to work with others to Finnish the year book in time which is a useful skill to know. Another reason is because it teaches you that life is not easy and you just have to push through it. An example, is if you were in year book club and you were falling behind you would learn how to get it finished in time. That is a good skill to have because in real life you will not always get all the time you what to Finnish something.

In conclusion, I believe he made a good decision. It is a good idea to have students do extracurricular activities because is puts students farther ahead by teaching problem salving skills and how to learn from you mistakes. It also teaches students good life skills like how to work with others and that life will not be easy. So I believe that are principles decision to have all students do at least one extracurricular activity was the right call.     ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
AC9801E7B7A1,"Most students enjoy participating in extracurricular activities, whether they are joining a club, joining a sports team, or helping out around the school, because these students are doing what they like to do on a daily basis. Even though most students are taking part in these activities and enjoying them, there are some students that are locked up tight and don't want to do anything because they are shy and nervous. Extracurricular activities are beneficial to students, because they can make new friends, expand their hobby interests and follow them, or improve socialization skills.

First, joining a club or sport team is a good way to find new friend groups, or a single friend. Even though most students already have more than enough friends, some students are trying very hard to make some more friends. Joining a club or sport team can help these students achieve their goal. If students join an activity with different student that they don't know, then some of those students could have some of the same interests, and have a lot in common. Discovering that they have a lot in common, and having similar hobbies, will lead to new friendships that go together like animals and food, you can't have one without the other.

Also, a new club is a good way to expand students' hobby interests. All students must enjoy doing something, whether it is reading a nice book in a chair that is soft as air, or helping a teacher with work in their classroom. If a student is interested in one single activity, that doesn't make them very enjoyable to be around, because all they want to do is the same thing. But, if they join an extracurricular activity, that student can get references to a new club or sport that they also might enjoy if they try it. It is good to have more than one activity that someone likes to participate in.

Finally, socialization skills are a key part of any student's day, so joining a club is a good way to work with those skills. If the club that the student joins requires community service, then a student would need to have the essential skills of being in public in order to take part in the activity. Some schools also include an event at the end of the school year that involves talking to a high level employee of a profession, like a mock interview. If a student has a goal set for their future employment and profession, then they would learn from the mock interviews the skills that are required to achieve that goal.

In conclusion, it is good for students to make the choice to participate in an extracurricular activity. When these students are deciding which activity to participate in, they should think about what kind of friends they could possibly make in that club or sport, what could branch off of that one activity to interest them more, and how it would improve their skill of socializing and being in public. Extracurricular activities are good for any student, whether they are shy and nervous, or social and looking for more friends.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I believe all students should have to do a extracurricular theres so many benefits like learning to work as a team , health benefits and just that experience from doing a extracurricular come.

Teamwork is such a necessary tool in todays ever changing workforce and just life in general and, a extracurricular is the best way that teamwork can be taught to kids from such a young age.

That virtue of working as a Team and never giving up on each other is truly instilled a person no better then during those late nights and those early practices. These skills are so influential in today's society and the Kids who do a extracurricular most of the time just do better in life. Due to the fact that there learning these such important skills from such a young age.

Your Body it's what makes you who you are it is you. One of the most important things in life is to keep your body healthy and a extracurricular can really do that for a person. There is so many ways a extracurricular can help you as person. Research has proven that one of the best ways to stay mentally healthy for Students is a extracurricular. With all the stress and pressure forced on students. Students need to unwind and distress.

Which a extracurricular can really do for a person.

Your body also majorly benefits from a extracurricular. I truly believe a extracurricular can make some Students just be better people have a healthier more fulfilling Life.

Theres a experience that comes along with a a extracurricular that I feel as though all Students should experience.

These are just some of the experiences that come along with a extracurricular that make Students happier better people in the long run with all the bad things that happen in students life lots of Students need that way of releasing there pint up aggression or just truly having a good time and living their life to the fullest.

These are just some of the many Benefits that come along with a extracurricular. a extracurricular benefits Students as a person give them Important skills they will need later in life and give them a experience like no other.

EF87277FCDA0,"Did you know that having an extracurricular activity can help you with high school and college? Have you ever had a passion for some kind of activity or sport, but couldn't do it because you never had the time? Well, now is your chance to achieve your goal of getting on varsity football, or working in student council. I agree with the principal that every student should have at least one extracurricular activity because it can help build new friends, build your self-esteem and confidence , and lastly it might just help you get a scholarship in college if you do a sport.

You know it's a struggle to make friends these days. People working together and helping each other out could possibly help them become friends. That is just one of the many perks of being on a team or group that supports you. The feeling of love, support, and praise can boost our confidence. This is one of the reasons why everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity.

Building your self esteem and confidence is one of the many things that we can achieve on our own. All you have to do is believe in your self and trust your friends. Supporting your friends and yourself can help everyone on a team come together as one. That is just one way of boosting yourself and your friends/teammates. Although, it is very important to encourage each other you must remember that doing it in a negative way could only effect your relationship with that person. That was my second reason for why I agree with the principal.

We all know that many people don't go to college due to the fact that they can't afford it. Well, maybe if you take a sport as your, extracurricular activity and you're good at it, they might consider giving you a full scholarship. Just keep in mind that you have to go to the same college and you can't quit the sport. As long as you enjoy it you will be fine. That is my last reason for supporting the principals decision.

Now knowing that picking an extracurricular activity can help you throughout your life. Consider that it can boost our confidence, help you gain friends, and many more. Hoping that you read this and agree with the principals decision. I also hope that you apply it to your life and become as successful as you can.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
C12F7FF27DE7,"I disagree with this decision. There are various reasons students shouldn't be required to take extracurricular activities. Students have responsibilities after school like, babysit, jobs, tutoring, and extracurricular activities can make students tired and less focused. if a student has to do an extracurricular activity it can take time away from their responsibilities.

Some students have to babysit their younger siblings or other family members after school. If they're required to take an extracurricular activity they wont be able to babysit and the child will go to some other care that costs a lot of money. If the student cant babysit then the parent will have to find someone else which can result in less money for food and other nessicities. It also makes less time for the parent to work just because they have to make sure that their child is getting the care they need and to make sure the child isn't getting neglected.

Another reason extracurricular activities aren't a smart idea is, some students have jobs and have to work after school. Sometimes students have to gets jobs to help support their family because their parents aren't making enough. If they have to do an extracurricular activity it can result in the student working later, and they can be less focused and tired during school. If students aren't focused in school they can get bad grades and eventually flunk out of school.

After school some students have to do tutoring or get help with certain classes so they don't fail. Extracurricular activities take time out of tutoring and gives the student less time to get help. Students should be able to have a brief tutoring session so they can understand what they're doing and pass. They shouldn't have to take time out of their tutoring just to do an extracurricular activity. They should be open to the help they need and be able to pass.

Extracurricular activities can make students excessively tired and stressed. Students already stress enough about school, they shouldn't have to stress about an extracurricular activity too. Sometimes sports or whatever the student is doing can make the student very tired and can run very late at night so they get less sleep and aren't focused in school which can make them fail. It can also result in students sleeping in class and not learning anything the teacher is teaching.

In conclusions i think making students do extracurricular activities is a bad idea. Some students babysit, have jobs, do tutoring or the activity can make them tired, stressed, and unfocused. Students shouldn't have to take extracurricular activities. I think that once a student gets out of school they should be able to take care of their responsibilities and not have to worry about an extracurricular activity.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
99578BFEDC92,"You are laughing with your friends and trying something new. After school activities opens your eyes to new things that maybe you wouldn't have thought about earlier and help you find friends that are interested in your same interests. Extracurricular activities are important for students to meet new people, get good exercise, and explore possible hobbies.

Sports are not only a great way to make friends but also are also beneficial in having good exercise.

When you play sports you are on a team with people that you may not know or people that you normally wouldn't talk to but through playing with them you can become friends. Sports can be a fun way to get exercise for instance if you join a basketball team you learn to play the game at the same time as having fun with friends and traveling to play other teams. There are a lot of sports to chose from which means that there is something for everyone to play and enjoy. Sports are just one of the activities that help you make friends and get good exercise.

Student council is perfect for people that want to effect change in their community or school. The SCA is a great learning experience for students to learn about public speaking and talking to large groups of people. You can have a big influence in your school by setting up events that bring people together or by just making a fun day for students. You can create events that will help the environment or people in need like a food drive or planting plants. The student council is a great way to get involved and also do fun things as well.

Music is another option of activities to chose from that engages people and teaches them how to play pieces of music. Your music can travel you to different places to play and can help you meet new people. The new music that you learn can challenge you to be a better musician. With music there are many components and instruments which means that every one has a important role and job to do. Music is another great option of activities that you can chose from.

After-school activities provide multiple ways for students to try different things, have fun, exercise, or continue to participate in things that they like. Sports are a great way to get exercise while still having fun and meeting new people. The SCA is one option of activities that engages students, helps the community, and also does fun things in and out of school. Finally music is a great way to try new thing whether that be trying new instruments or even new music styles.

CB8D9DD083FC,"Have you ever found yourself bored and lonely at home after school? A great way to liven up your everyday life is to join an extracurricular activity. These activities should be made mandatory because while a student is enrolled in one, they can explore new hobbies, make new friends, and become more happy with themselves.

Often times, finding something that you are interested can be difficult, but finding new hobbies will come easily when students are exposed to an abundant amount of extracurricular options. Finding an extracurricular that appeals to you can spice up your life and create new found passion for an activity. Extracurricular also keep students on their toes and excited to learn more about things that interest them. Lastly, a students choice of activity could display what sort of career pathway they may want to take in the future by exposing them to many new fields of interest.

For some, making new friends might be hard or even scary. Making these activities mandatory would push students to interact with one-another. Having more close friends make the school experience more bearable. Being surrounded by those with similar interests gives these students the chance to bond over something that they have mutual interest in. Finally, when students make friends they are exposed to all sorts of new backgrounds, cultures, and family lifestyles.

Creating a minimum amount of extracurricular activities that students must participate in makes students happier with themselves. After a students does work within their activity they feel more accomplished than they would if they were sitting at home doing nothing. When an activities participants complete a major accomplishment, they can credit that success to their hard work and determination. Allowing students the chance to better themselves at a something they like to do creates the feeling of self respect and self-pride.

To many it may seem like making extracurricular activities mandatory would be a waste of time and not impact students in any way. While these concerns are understandable, these extracurricular activities would spark interest in inquisitive students,allow students the chance to make new friends, and give students something to be proud of. The pros of having mandatory extracurricular activities heavily outweighs the cons, and these activities could have a positive and lasting impact on the lives of many students. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
1463D1D9EC8F,"Everyone has a hobby or something they enjoy doing at home why not just do it at school with your friends. I agree with the principal for making everyone stay after school for a extracurricular activity because you would stay active by playing sports and running around, you meet new people and friends by staying after with all the kids from your school, and you have fun with playing with you friends.

By staying after school you stay active and healthy by playing sports. I love staying after school for night hawk which is are after school program we play basketball on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Its a lot of fun when the teachers join and play with us and we have a big game. We are staying healthy by running around and jumping up and down, bringing up are hart rate and sweating. This is why I think the principal should make everyone stay after school for a extracurricular

When you stayed after everyday for weather its a club,sport or another activity there will be other kids, some might be your friend but some you might not know. If they are doing the same after school activity you must have some things in common like why your in the same activity so its a easy way to meet new people and friends. This is why I think the principal should make everyone stay after school for a extracurricular activity.

The after school program is pretty fun because of the verity of activities like sports, dance teams, clubs and more. My friends and I like the sports after school because there is soccer and basketball the more kids that stay after the more fun it is because we can have bigger games. This is why I think the principal should make everyone stay after school for a extracurricular activity.

I agree with the principal making everyone stay after for a extracurricular activity because I think it would keep you active and healthy, meet new people and friends, and have a lot of fun.

5CE935EFB869,"Imagine you are in a classroom at school. You're listening to the morning announcements and near the end of the announcements you hear your principal say, ""From this point on, all students are required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity."" This is most likely thing in some schools already but if this were to happen at my school, I would disagree with this very much. I would disagree with this new rule because students have lives outside of school and some students would not do anything.

First of all, students have lives outside of school. When students get home, they have things to do, these things often include homework. Extracurricular activities consume valuable time that students need to complete all kinds of homework like, essays and projects or even just some simple paperwork. When students are short on time because of these activities and can't complete homework or projects on time, they get very stressed out. When they don't finish in time then have to turn in incomplete work, it could significantly lower their grade in that class. This happens more than you may think. For example, I used to play soccer after school and practice would normally end around 8:30 pm, so it was pretty late. Due to the fact that it was late and I still had things that I needed to finish for school, it added to the stress that i was already dealing with.

Finally, Some students just wouldn't do anything. Just because the principal said that students have to take part in least one extracurricular activity, doesn't mean that the students who didn't want to join in the first place will do anything to contribute to whatever activity they decided to do. When a student doesn't want to do something, most of the time they just decide not to do it, especially if it doesn't affect any of their grades. This is most likely what a majority of students would do if this rule was implemented. I know that this is what would happen because when I was at private school, they made us participate in after school activities. Those that didn't want to do anything, including me, didnt do anything.

In conclusion, I would disagree with this rule if it was put into place because Students have things to do outside of school, and the students that don't want to do anything, won't do anything. I think this idea would just be a huge waste of time and i'm glad that it is not a thing in my school.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
5C89C0506A97,"I strongly disagree with students having to participate in extracurricular activities because students come home tired from hours of work. They come home with having to do work at home and having to do homework from the school. I think it is a horrible idea to put students on an extracurricular activities that they maybe dont even want to be in. Kids having to do a extracurricular activity that they didnt even want to do can lead to stress on the student.

One reason is that students come home to having to work at home and work from the school. They have so much to do and only having very little to even no free time. Adding an extracurricular activity in the students day is very stressful for the kid. For example, some kids come home from school, he/she will go to work from home and then work from school. Even having to go to school for hours doing tests, assignments, work, projects and more. This adds up so much stress for the student.

Another reason is that students come home tired and stressed knowing that they have to do more work at home. The kids need to have rest and free time at home. It is so unfair to a student that they have to do an extracurricular activity on top of all the work that they have to do after school. An example is, A student having to do a extracurricular activity that they didnt even want to do in the first place causes the to get really stressed on all of this work that the student has to go through.

I disagreed with having a student participate in a extracurricular activity. It is just so ridiculous on how much work the students are getting. These are kids not adults, they cant let kids do so much work at home and at school. They need their rest, they need their free time and sleep. With all of this work on a student, its just very stressful on the kid.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
A9FE240AEBCA,"The principal is making the kids stay after, good or bad? Extracurricular activities can benefit many students in many ways. Not all students play sports or participate in any activity which requires interaction with peers outside of school. Many students at many schools are obese because of matters like this, playing an after school sport may benefit them, and many other students may discover a hobby or sport that they excel at or are interested in. I agree with the principal for making every student stay after and participate in extracurricular activities because it gives students a chance to make new friends, stay active, and help develop social skills.

Staying after school can help every student with making friends. Playing sports usually requires students to be on a team, and a team requires teamwork. To establish a good foundation for teamwork students need to know the members of their team, this will result in making friends. Making friends can help many students with many things. Students that suffer from depression can largely benefit from making friends as they will find people who will help their self-esteem and make them feel a lot better. Students that may have no real friends or people that they talk to on a daily basis can largely benefit from playing sports or being in a group that requires collaboration, such as yearbook or student council.

Participating in extracurricular activities can also benefit by keeping students in shape and by helping them stay active. Many students in many schools all over the world are overweight or even obese. participating in a sport after school on a daily basis can help students with such conditions. Participating in a sport can help students feel better about themselves and help them lose unwanted weight or attention. I can speak from experience because I used to be overweight and after playing a lot of sports and staying active I now not only play sports to be active, but because its refreshing and fun. Many students can benefit from an extracurricular sport as I did.

Staying after school also has the possibility of helping students with social skills. There aren't many things that students can do after school that don't require them to be social, communicate, or interact with their peers. Many sports that schools have to offer require for students to be on a team. Any club that students participate in requires them to be in a group or session that requires them to interact with the group to get their part done. Lastly, any council they want to join requires them to communicate with not only peers but teachers and faculty as well.

Overall, I agree the principal requiring students to stay after school to participate in any activity. Whether it's football or basketball that needs for students to stay active, or student coucil or year book club that requires them to interact with other peers to get anything done. These activities can benefit every students in multiple ways that help them with many life skills. Extracurricular activities are indeed very beneficial, and the principal has my vote to enforce this rule. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Well here's my opinion, I personally agree with it because it gives students a chance to go out and do fun stuff instead of sitting in the house all day. I think the principal should add this because it could be something fun and new to try in your lifetime.

Here a couple of my reason's why our principal should do this. First, If a student really like's one certain sport but they've never been able to play before this would be good for them to go out there and actually do something that they really enjoy. Next, I think our principal should do this because it could be something new to some students and they could actually enjoy it. Then, If a student doesn't like the options that the principal listed then they could ask the principal to add something that they enjoy and if other students do to then they can also be apart of that. Finally, I think our principal should do this because it's a good way for students to go out and do fun things that they enjoy, instead of going home and just laying around doing nothing.

However, some students may not agree with this idea but I think that it's something fun and new to try in your lifetime. But like some people say always try something new even if you think your not gonna enjoy it you never know the possible outcome you might actually enjoy it.

For example, it improves your physical and mental health, helps build new skills, helps keep grades up, and can benefit many people.

To begin, extracurricular activities are extremely good for your physical and mental health. If your extracurricular activity is a sport, it can improve your health and help you build muscle. An extracurricular activity prevents you from laying around and snacking on unhealthy foods. By doing an extracurricular activity, you will be occupied and will burn off lots of fat. Also, extracurricular activities will improve mental toughness by challenging you with extremely fun challenges.

Secondly, an extracurricular activity will help you build skills that you can use on a day to day basis. Doing an extracurricular activity requires you to interact with a lot of new people. By interacting with new people you will build lots of new social skills that will help change you from a shy person, to a kind outgoing person. Most extracurricular activities are only one hour a day. Since the activities have a short time to do everything, they will teach you how to manage your time and how to stay organized. Not only will you learn skills that will help you from a day to day basis, but some of the extracurricular activities will teach you skills that you can use to show off.

Also, an extracurricular activity will help students keep their grades up. Most extracurricular activities require kids to have good grades to participate. This is a very good motivation for students to keep their grades up. not only does an extracurricular activity motivate students to keep their grades up, but extracurricular activities help make you think harder. A report written by scientist Generic_Name, showed that 93% of students who participated in an extracurricular activity, reported that all of their grades went up by at least 5%.

Lastly, an extracurricular activity can benefit a lot of people. There are multiple extracurricular activities that donate money to the needy and the environment. By participating in an extracurricular activity you can help raise money for many causes. By raising money not only will you help the needy and the environment, but you will give yourself a big sense of accomplishment. Being in an extracurricular activity that raises money for people can help you later on in life as well. You can use it to get into nice colleges and to get a good job.

In conclusion, Students should be required to do one extracurricular activity. I think that students should be required to do one extracurricular activity because there is many benefits.

Forcing a student to participate in an activity they are uninterested in can be a waste of time, it can be an overtaking of a student's freedom, cause students' health to worsen, and students may already have a busy schedule. I disagree with the principal's decision because pressuring students do an extra curricular activity can be a huge waste of time, it can cause unneeded amounts of stress, and students may not have the time to participate.

To begin with, it can be a huge waste of time to make participation in extra curricular activities mandatory. This is because students might not want to participate in an extra curricular activity, students might not find an extra curricular activity that they enjoy and want to participate in, and it might not be helping them in the future. Students might not want to participate in any extra curricular activity because they might not feel up to it, or they are doing fine right now and want to keep it that way. Students might not find an extra curricular activity they enjoy and want to join because they might want to do an extra curricular activity but the school might not offer the activities they enjoy, and even if the school had an option to create your own club, there would be too many clubs created and not enough people participating in them. Lastly, it might not be helping them in the future because the activity could just be a fun activity, and might not help them on their college resume, or help them get a job. Implementing this rule or policy would just waste student's time and just force them to stay at school for an extra one to two hours on top of the seven hours they attend school. This policy won't be helping them but instead wasting their precious time.

Another reason, participating in extra curricular activities can cause an unneeded amount of stress. This is because students might already have enough work from teachers and adding more work from extra curricular activities isn't needed, students could also be pressured with the extra work and might not want to do it to the best of their ability, and students' health will worsen. Students might already have loads of work from teachers and adding more work is just going to put so much on their agenda, and students won't be able to enjoy themselves. Students may also be pressured with the extra work and might not want to do it to the best of their ability which in some activities is an important factor because of competitive and team events. Students' health will also worsen because of how much stress they are dealing with, and some students might not have a method to cope with the stress, for example, students might have mood swings, develop gray hairs, and stop hanging out with friends. Students also might not get enough sleep finishing their work which can cause a lack of focus, and cause students' grades to fall. This proves that if this policy gets implemented then students could deteriorate their health and cause them to fail their core classes which would affect their future and will lower the school's statistics.

Finally, making students join extra curricular activities isn't practical because students might not have enough time to participate in the activities. This is due to how some students are already enrolled in a sports club, or another program, most students might not be able to stay one to two hours after school, and students need to do their homework on time. Lots of students are already enrolled in a sports club or another activity and making them stay after school could cause them to cancel their classes or screw up their schedule. Students also need to do their homework on time which is a big issue since some students don't do their work without any extra activities, now imagine what would happen to students' homework records if there were extra activities. This shows that if this rule existed then some students wouldn't attend the activities, some students would have to give up activities that they've been attending for years, and a ton of students would never complete their homework on time.

In conclusion, implementing a mandatory extra curricular activity policy will be a waste of time for students because it won't help them and just force them to be taking the activity, it will cause a huge amount of stress because you need to be doing work that isn't needed as well as homework, and students will not have enough time to participate. I urge you to think about how many students won't enjoy this program, and just want to participate in what they want. You will stress out students, and students who want to participate can participate in extra curricular activities, but it shouldn't be a mandatory program. If you force students to participate in extra curricular activities you hand students buckets of unneeded work, drown them in stress, and mess up their entire schedule.    ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
94E1D46A0544,"The principle wants all students to take at least one extracurricular activity I agree with the principle because having one will help you real under stand to manage your time wisely,and it can help you under stand how you spend your time. My opinion is if he makes this a requirement for students will have a better chance to succeed in the real world with what they learned for example managing,and learning the value of time will help you make the right chooses.

One reason I agree with the principle is that studies have shown that have done a extracurricular are the most likely to succeed in life cause they have learned the too most important things in life to me is what you should use your. Time on or what is worth your time not much people know this but time is very valuable if you know how to use it wisely you have a better chance to succeed. Dont get me wrong you can still succeed without using knowing this but cause you dont know it your wasting to much time and the extracurricular activities most likely get you a scholarship therefor you are using this because they people used the time therefor they can have much more opportunities.

Second reason I agree is that time is priceless it is not infinite people dont know how much time they really have therefor its better to make the best of it before its all gone therefor the people who have chosen to use there time. Wisely they have much more time cause they have done what they had to do getting more time but it docent mean the people around them will get the same cause they chose there path and they chose there toured success. By choosing that path they have chosen there future which docent really change unless there has been a large impact like death or courage to do what ever it takes to succeed no mater what any body says to try to turn you down.

Final reason is managing time is what you need for jobs therefor if you are learning it early own the essayer it is,and to lost of people this is a great skill to have therefor this quality will get you many jobs since you know how to. Work your schedule therefor there work on time team projects have time on your schedule and someone cant make it they type of people often help out and get promotion or get played into a low payed job but that docent really happen often.

Sincerly,therefor if the princple dicidcides to make having a elxctoal activity a requirment he or she is leading students to succeed in th future if all schools do this etheir their will be less poverty or more students passing by the years will drop out which do the people choice?",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
208C0541845A,"I do not agree with with the principal. The students in the school shouldn't have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. They shouldn't be pressured to participate in a school activity because they should be more worried about their grades staying up and not dropping, if they are trying to play a school sport, some parents might not have the time to pick their children up, if the activity is after school, and the students could feel uncomfortable participating in an activity that they don't feel comfortable doing.

The students should really be more worried about their grades staying up, most definitely, if the student school activity is a sport. They could be struggling a lot in school, but they wouldn't be able to play the sport, if they have low grades. They could be able to play to the sport, if they can maintain having good grades and keeping them up. The students should actually be able to play the sport, and keep their grades up at the same times.

Some parents might not be able to pick their kids up from school, if it is an after school activity. Parents work a lot, so it's hard for them to leave work, and then be able to stop by the school and pick their children up from school on time. You never know what the students and parents could be going through at home, and it could be the reason why their parents wont be able to pick their kids up from school and why kids don't have a ride. The situation going on could be very personal, so they shouldn't be focused on finding a ride home just for an after school activity.

The students could feel very uncomfortable participating in an activity that they do not feel comfortable doing. They could be getting pressured to do better in a sport they don't really enjoy. They also could be getting bullied for not being good enough, but the still have to participate in the sport, because the have to participate in at least one school activity.

It's a lot more reason why I could disagree with students having to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I chose to write my top reason down because these reason could affect students in a bad way. The students having to worry about keeping their grades up, finding a ride home after school, and feeling uncomfortable are not ways that students should be feeling just because they are being pressured to participate in a extracurricular activity.      ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
C4B59C0A3D14,"The possible consequences which may stem from forcing anyone to set aside one of their most essential resources, that being time, in favor of performing an activity that, prior to the former action, had neither affected nor interested are not observed clearly enough, in many cases. A person's free time is, for the most part, an opportunity for them to enjoy themselves, if they wish, or to not. The choice is surely their's and their family's, not that of an outsider. Indeed, no student should be made to unwillingly take part in an extracurricular activity. This is due to their extremely busy schedules, as well as the necessity to protect their personal freedoms and interests. Free time is such a valuable commodity to school children that taking it away could negatively impact them in various ways.

Children are exceedingly busy. Their schedules may allow barely any extra time, and they are therefore forced to sacrifice something in order to engage in an extracurricular activity. A student of any grade deals with large amounts of homework, and the quantities only grow as they progress through the school system. They must also complete their chores at home, as well as any jobs, such as walking dogs or baby sitting, that they have chosen to take on. Interfering with their lives could result in declining grades, a loss of interest in formerly enjoyable activities, and rising tensions at home, a place where schools should possess little power.

A principal should be unable to control students' activities outside of the school. Students have their own livelihoods wherein schools would be remiss to interfere if they are unwelcome. The interruption of the day to day life of their families may not be welcomed, and could result in spats between members. A boundary is being crossed when a principal is able to force a student to participate in an activity that is entirely separate from the school and which they may not want any part in, for the child may already have their own personal interests that do not involve any extracurricular activities.

Forcing students, who may simply have interests which lie elsewhere, to take part in extracurricular activities may only succeed in becoming a deleterious factor to their enjoyment of their work and activities. Students who enjoy other pastimes, such as reading and spending time with family, would find the time utilized for the aforementioned activities cut into or taken away. Those attempting to focus on succeeding academically may suddenly be mandated to decide between complying with their principal and completing their assignments. It is cruel to expect students to comply with a rule which throws their interests and aspirations to the wind.

Seeing as how students struggle with busy schedules, the principals of schools ought to be prohibited from mandating them to engage in extracurricular activities. Student's freedoms and interests are experiencing the risk of being overturned. The interference with families and free time may harm the students a great deal more than it would help them, and the principal has no authority to step that far into a student's personal life. The consequences of such an action must be considered, as they have the potential to severely harm a student. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
DCE93861CC17,"Have you ever came home and been tired but had to finish something? If you answered with yes, imagine if you had to do at least one extra activity after school. I believe that we should'nt be forced to do extracurricular activity because you might be tired after school, have to work, or help around the house after school.

My first reason is, maybe your tired after school. all of us has been tired at least once after school and wanted to sleep for a bit instead of doing your homework right away or maybe you were possibly hungry. Maybe you were sleepy and wanted to sleep for 30 minutes and then grab something to eat after you woke up from your nap.

Maybe you wanted to eat something because you haven't ate all day and its better to relax your mind instead of going right into work after school.

My second reason, is that maybe your old enough to work and have a after school job you work at for a couple of hours. You might have a job and have to work right after school and you dont come home until dark and its hard for you to do anything else after you get off work because you have to do your homework and then head to bed for the next day of school. Another thing is that maybe your schedule will be ruined if you have to do an extracurricular activity after school cause of the time and the time you might have to work, can interfere with your time schedule.

The last and final reason, is that you have to watch over your siblings after school or pet sit your neighbors dogs and walk and feed them. Sometimes, you have to watch your younger brothers or sisters and you are busy most of the time to get anything else done. The other thing is that if your parents dont come home until late you might also have to clean the house and do other things such as wash the plates, throw the trash out and many more.

Which brings me to my conclusion, we shouldnt have to do an extracurricular activities because you might be tired or you have to work and or take care of the house, So in my opinion I don't think we should have to do anything extra after school instead take the rest of the day off.                  ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
3ACABC081389,"Middle school, where the days seem to drag on hour by hour, just waiting, living until the next bell. Millions of students across America suffer from this treacherous cycle everyday. Although millions suffer from this process, not all students go home just to repeat it all over again. A large majority of people participate in at least one extracurricular activity no matter if it is just being on the student council, playing sports, or simply being in the yearbook club, it makes school so much more enjoyable. Not only does this give teenagers something to look forward to after school, but it also give them something to strive for in and out of the school day. These activities also teach students a variety of essential life lessons that they could never learn in school. Therefore, students should be required to take part in at least one extracurricular activity. Overall, participating in extracurricular activities is extremely positive because people can learn time management, fall in love with something that they would never have tried, and it forces people to figure out their main priorities in life.

People often find themselves overwhelmed with how much they have to do and how little time they have to do it. Taking part in more activities outside of school can help to teach these people how to manage their time properly so that they can avoid the overwhelming feeling that drags them down. For example, students might not get to their homework because they have taken too much time to do other unimportant things since they are unable to manage their time. This can be fixed by giving these people something else to work on so that they are required to be disciplined enough to get everything done. Learning time management also helps students receive more free time than ever before since they know to do the important things first and be done with it. These time management skills will also help people much further down the road of life.

Many young teenagers are often too timid to step out of their comfort zone on their own, so sometimes they might need a little push to get started. There are so many positives to trying new things like joining clubs or sports. Extracurricular activities can do so much for people in life and some will never get to experience that drive and love that comes with those activities. If these students never try something new they will miss and opportunity of a lifetime and miss out on so many friendships. As an example, Michael Phelps' mom made him sign up for swimming as a precaution because she did not want him to drown. After that, he ended up falling in love with the sport and going farther than he could have ever imagined. For these reasons, students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity.

A large majority of middle school students have absolutely no clue of what they want to do in the future or what their main concerns are because they have nothing to worry about other than school. Extracurricular activities would help them figure out what their main priorities are exactly. If they are concerned about these activities, it would help them make better decisions in order to keep those priorities straight. These responsible actions would assist in the process of figuring out what students want to pursue in the future and therefore make it easier to accomplish a goal because they would have been working towards it for a long time.

In conclusion, there are countless reasons why students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities, some specific reasons being that they teach proper time management, could show you how much you love something, and assist in figuring out main priorities in life. There are so many positives that they outweigh any negatives that could arise. These life lessons will expand and travel so far with people in their journey. Some students may never do these activities after middle school, but at least they will have taken a small part in some of the most moving learning experiences ever known to school system.         ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

They get to hang out with friends. Because they get talk with each other. Get more social with each others because in sports you get to play and win competition with your friends. This is important because you get to know how to get more social in the future.

Get to know more about each other. Because they need to know with they are playing, and how is their mood to talk with other persons. To getting to with each other is a great idea of doing an activity in school. This important when you get to do in a activity in school you have to know each other.

Get to do fun things. Because you get to play with your friends. This important because you get to do fun things with your friends by competing with each other.

5A3EF40C9936,"Extracurricular activities is something that doesn't always amaze kids especially not by force. A extracurricular activity are things such as sports, run for student council, work on the yearbook. As a principle of any school you should want a child to participate in some kind of activity but that's not something that should be forced on them. It may seem like a good idea to enforce a rule that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, but in my perspective I don't like the principles idea and I have a couple of reasons why.

The first reason is because, as a kid we don't like being forced to do things. Yes, it's good to give a child a push at something so they can try a new thing and maybe it will be apart of their future; but if a principle or person forces it on them it may stop the child from doing it ever again. They may get the idea that they have no say in what they do. My next reasoning is that what if a child takes his or her time doing another activity outside of school, handling both things could be a lot of pressure and cause stress because they still have several other things to worry about. The kid might get to thinking ""this is to much"" and ""this is a lot to worry about"" and it may cause them to not want to do anything in life if they don't find what they're doing is something they enjoy. The principle should make it a option instead of a rule or something you have to do. I believe whatever activity a child participates in they should be willing to do it and should be something they are amazed by.

The principle should take his idea into thought and see how the students feel. The students should have good reasoning for why they agree or disagree with the principle. The point behind my reasons is that as a adult you have to consider what the child wants sometimes. What you may think is best for a child isn't always what they want. If you demand them to do a lot of things their whole mind set could change on how life should be. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

C88B4EAD8DE4,"I agree with the decision to mandate all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It allows students to discover and explore many different activities that potentially could be a career path one desires to pursue, allows for students to make new friends, and teaches students teamwork and leadership.

Participating in an extracurricular activity allow students to discover many different activities that can potentially be a career one desires to pursue. Studies indicate that 65% of students who participate in an extracurricular activity at a young age pursue an occupation that utilizes/relates to a skill pertained while participating in the extracurricular activity. Students are also exposed more to the field that their club relates with. The main reason why I want to be either a senator or a computer scientist when I grow up is that I currently participate in the Model United Nations club as well as the Computer Science club. If I hadn't participate in those two clubs, my career choices would most likely be different because I wouldn't of been exposed to that area. A student who participates in an extracurricular activity also gains more knowledge in that area of expertise which can result in that student finding a profession relating to that activity with less difficulty than a someone who hasn't been as exposed or knowledgeable.

Participating in an extracurricular activity allows students to make new friends. The main reason why a student would join an extracurricular club is because they are interested in what that specific club does. A student who joins the Computer Science club is introduced to other students who share a common interest: Computers. The majority of after school clubs meet on a weekly basis, some more than others. Nevertheless, students in an after school club would see the same students at least one time a week. This provides each and every one of the students the chance to interact with each other and befriend one another. With this in mind, joining an extra curricular activity allows students to make new friends.

The majority of extracurricular activities teach students teamwork and leadership. Students that are part of extracurricular activities that compete such as the football team or Science Olympiad must rely on each other in order to win the competition. Other clubs such as Model United Nations illustrate the importance of both as students must work with and lead other students towards resolving the conflict. No matter what club students participate in, they require an important skill: the ability to effectively and diligently work with others in order to reach a common goal. Requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity provides them the opportunity to learn teamwork and leadership; a lifelong skill.

In conclusion, I agree with the decision to make students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It allows students the chance to discover and further investigate many different many different activities which potentially could be the career path a student desires to pursue, gives the chance for students to make new friends, and teaches students teamwork and leadership. It's in the student's best interest to join an extracurricular activity because even though it requires extra time out of the student's day, It teaches lifelong skills him/her can use throughout life and makes it easier to find his/her way through life, no matter what club a student decides to participate in. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
62D3895B702E,"What do you think about making students participate in extracurricular activities. Well I agree that making students do something that could be fun also great for physical health is a amazing idea, learning new things from it, however it's not great for all people. for example people that have no time or have problems that are going on in there personal life.

The best things about making them active, they can learn how to work as a team and thats hard to learn but easy to teach, disliking the fact no one does it. Making them play a sport of any kind can help them with teamwork also building spirit or character. Then again not everyone likes sports some like art or acting we can use kids talents to also help the school. Lets say the first thing what comes to mind of course a Talent Show parents always like seeing there kid doing what they love. Doing this without making them will boost there spirits, Therefore helping the school in the process.

""I don't want to"" or ""thats to much work"" these are the words that kids have been saying for decades. Every kid has or still are saying this they just want nothing to do with sports,talent shows,going outside even getting out of bed. However when they hear a phone ring,console turning on, games in general there like a rocket going to the moon and never stopping. You can stop them they just don't want to, so doing this ""they have to play a sport or do some extracurricular activity"" is not going to work. Bus as my parents say theres always a way and for this case there is but I disagree with the idea. Honestly though there are a bunch of ways to help teachers with technology. Main way is to help them make there teaching less boring for students using kahoot,coolmath, something that students can create. Example like what are tech teacher is doing, creating a house using technology for kids or making math games.

There is the good active people and the just stay inside all day kind of people, no one really looks at the people who don't have time they shove them in the corner of stay inside group and move on. Even if they play a sport or go outside. Most people don't have time to do more things just for the school even if they want to they are either mentally of physically can't do it. And some person starts making them do more and think there just bratty and lazy, in conclusion they do what you say because its for the best. Now you have hundreds of kids going to school at seven in the morning and going home at ten at night. All I am saying is that not everyone can do it you need to give these children a will to say no! even if there lying because you never know if there not.

Making children do something to me sound cruel. But if you just flip the picture around doing it a different way it can help people learn even if there not in school. Now I don't have a specific answer if I agree or not everything has a good and bad side, it can and will help you learn new and important things, therefore all I can say is do you agree?                                ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
112AA24D20BC,"Some years ago before my uncle became a doctor, I saw how he was struggling with anxiety attacks of too much studying time at medical school, but he noticed that he needed to do different activities to get distracted a little bit and at the same time get rid of all the stress. Every student participating at least in one extracurricular activity is a really good idea because they could do sports, get in book clubs or help around doing community service. If all the students would do extra activities , they're lives could be really different and better in many ways with variations of experiences and less stress.

Students doing any sports would be really helpful for their health. Mostly every student at school is seating on a chair for hours and at home they are probably just also seating on the couch for more hours . A human body needs to move and do some exercise to have a good health. Sports are really a good ting that makes your body feel or have some changes just like on teens they're metabolism makes them get taller or develop their bodies. Even if the students do just 20 minutes a day stills helpful for them.

Book clubs are something really interesting and fun for students to do. Do you ever just feel like your mind needs a break? Well books are the best option as a break , they take you to many different places around the world even places that dont even exist without moving from anywhere you are at. You can find new adventures, drama, romance and some things you never experienced; just like transferring your mind to another world, and distracting you from your regular life. Making you have and enjoy some good time without going somewhere. In the book clubs you can discuss with people about all those thoughts you have about what you just read, and could also find someone that thinks the exact same things as you.

Doing community service not only helps others, it also helps you! You might be asking yourself right now how? Well, helping your community it's teaching you as a student how important cooperation is , helping others brings you happiness, and that feeling of how responsible you are becoming. Also, community service helps students a lot with credits for an advanced diploma or even a scholarship for college. If you never have helped your community thinking is nothing fun, you should consider it as a extracurricular activity that you can do.

Every student should do an extracurricular activity after schools so theyre body and mind can have an productive break. Any type of activity helps you and relax's you when need a break.

D889C48DD497,"Should students participate in extracurricular activities after school. Participating in activities after school is a tremendous thing because it can get your mind off of school work, it can even give you some exercise from time to time. Some people may say it is a bad thing to do an activity after school because there is no time for studying or homework, but they are wrong. They are wrong because if you play a sport and have practice after school is normally no more than an hour and a half. Lets say you got out of school at 3:30 and went to bed at 10:00 then you would still have 4 to 5 hours to study or do homework.

Even though there are some downs to having outside activities there is still that exercise portion to it.

The biggest thing to do for exercise is a sport. Sports get you moving and help you exercise while you are having fun. I had a friend who used to always play video games or just sit down all day so I suggested to him that he should play a sport with me and he did. When my friend started to play he told me it was really fun and how he started to stop playing video games. So to have all students do an extracurricular activity could make some people be just like my friend.

Outside activities are also bad because they can take up way to much time and are to far away. Depending on what the student wants to do, like a school sport it could take up to 45 minuets to get to practice or a game. When this is the situation they might not be at home for studying or homework for up to 5 hours. This could make the student stressed, angry, or even sometimes sad. Some things you could do to help this is do you school work in the car since you are not home for most of they day and could be driving for a while, or find something that is closer to home.

Past research has shown that 90% of the people who do something out of school that is close to home live a happier and healthier life. Outside activities even help students grow academically. When a student is happier they do better in school and don't sit there and worry about how boring there life is. I know this is true because when I did not play basketball I was not doing to well in school, I was always bored which made me never pay attention. When I joined my basketball team I was never bored and did way better in school.

yes, students should participate in extracurricular activities after school. even though there are some down sides to this research has proven that most people have a healthier life. some of the things you could do are play a sport, find a job, or even volunteer at the local animal shelter. so if you ever get the chance to do one of these activities don't pass it up. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I do not agree with this decision,for there are many things that affect students daily lives and adding more would be quite troublesome. Although it would not be that horrible if they had more options to appeal to a wider group.

One of the ways this is a bad idea is because many students have little siblings to take care of,and making them stay at school can be hurting them more than helping them. Although it would help the student with social skills and teamwork,but most students just cant make the time frame. The students would need to be home at the regular time because their parents might have to go to work and they need someone to make sure the house won't burn down. You,however might counter argument with they are adults and need to be responsible for their actions.

For example if a student had more physical strength and leadership ability then they would obviously do football. However what about people who want to cook or do chess. Although it would not be bad if they had more clubs to choose from. But the principal is not giving them enough ability to express themselves if they dont have a club for everyone to enjoy. If there were more options I would be as opposed as there would be a choice for everyone,but the principal is not letting them go home on time if the activity is after school.

There are a plethora of reasons not to go to an after school activity,but then they do improve important social skills.

Therefore, I believe that students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity, as they can help to boost social skills, cope with depression, and develop new hobbies.

First off, mandatory participation for extracurricular activities can help boost social skills for students. Many students suffer from social anxiety, and ""having any sort of extracurricular activity in a child's life can majorly boost the development of social skills due to working with others, especially in the 10-16 year old range,"" according to an article by psychologist Kathryn Wilson. This means that if children participate in extracurricular activities with peers, then they will most likely develop friendships with said peers.

Another reason for enforcing mandatory participation for extracurricular activities is that they can help students cope with depression. Everybody has something they like to do, and there is almost always other people who enjoy the same thing. According to a study performed by Stanford University students in 2018, 93% of students who had been diagnosed with depression reported feeling ""happier and more energetic"" after spending time with people who had similar interests as them. This means that spending time with like-minded people can help students combat depression.

Finally, participation in extracurricular activities should be mandatory because they can help students find new hobbies. For example, pretend that you are a student who has always wanted to fly a drone, but never has had the chance to. By joining a flight club, you could experience flying a drone, and possibly develop a new hobby! In fact, according to a survey done by

Scholastic in 2017, 96 out of 100 students who joined a new club found out that they enjoyed the club! This means that 96% of students who joined a new club were able to find a new hobby.

However, some people believe that extracurricular activities should not be mandatory. They say that some students prefer not to participate in an extracurricular activity. To test that, a group of William and Mary University students went to 3 different middle schools and asked every 8th grade student whether or not they would like participation in extracurricular activities to be mandatory. Afterwards, they took the 152 students who said no due to not wanting to have to participate in an extracurricular activity and asked them to join an extracurricular program of their choosing for one week. After the week, every single student who said that they did not want to participate in an extracurricular activity changed their minds.

Ultimately, students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity, as they can help to boost social skills, cope with depression, and develop new hobbies. After reading this, I strongly encourage you to go out and find a group of people with similar interests as you, be it online or in person. You might be surprised at how much you enjoy it!",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
CEF5DF69B6C8,"I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it give students a chance to be more social, and active. It also gives students an idea for what they want to do in the future. Most students stay at home, watch TV, and eat snacks, which is very unhealthy. Kids these days are not as active or as social as they should be. Extracurricular activity gives students a chance to get up, and get moving. Sports like basketball, soccer, and volleyball, are things that get kids excited about geting up, and getting active. Extracurricular doesn't only allow kids to get up and get moving, it also give students a glimpse into the real world. For example students that want to go out for student council get the experience of what its like to work in the office, and be a boss to people. Most students that go out for the yearbook might want to be a professional photographer when they grow up. Yearbook is a great way to start, every professional has to start small somewhere, and yearbook is the right place. Professional athletes weren't always as great as they are now. They all had to start out small, and see they're mistakes and fix it. In conclusion, I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it gives students an idea for the future and also sets goals for students. Every profession has their own weaknesses, but with more help, and more focus, and dedication their strengths always come out. ",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
E3EF725157D1,"I disagree with that decision because, not all students may want to do an extracurricular activity. Some students have a lot on their plates already. To make it mandatory for students to participate in an extracurricular is inhumane. Students have the right to decide whether or not to join an extracurricular or not. Some students don't do one because they don't have the money to pay for the equipment to do some of the extracurricular activities offered.

Another reason I disagree is because, students might not have the time to do an extracurricular such as, sports or music. Students might have tons of homework they have to do everyday. Not to mention all the papers and other assignments that need to be turned in on time.

The third reason is students have enough to stress about without having to worry whether they had an upcoming basketball game. Students have to study for tests without getting distracted by other things. They already have to stress about the big end of year tests so, giving them something else to stress about might not be good for their health. It isn't all just about stress but it's also about health in general. If people overwork themselves they are going to become sick and if they are sick without knowing they are sick, it could also spread to others. This happend to me where I was overworking myself and right before winter break I got really sick. I have ways to relieve stress but some people might not. Therefore, schools shouldn't overwork their students.

I do agree that it would be a good way to get people interested in something but making it mandatory for people to something they don't want to be doing or they don't have the time is just so wrong on so many levels. I do three extracurricular activities, chorus, orchestra, and karate. All of those activities require me to exert a lot of energy and I put a lot of time and money into being the best that I can be in all of those activities. People who neither have the time nor the money could never be as successful as the people who actually have the time to practice and who have the money to buy new equipment whenever it breaks or is damaged.

In conclusion, I think that students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because they are being put under so much pressure already its not fair to force them into doing something that they might not want to participate in. Most people that don't do an extracurricular already have some reason for not joining one already. It might be because they don't have the time, or because they have to take care of their younger sibling because their parents work late. People never know what someone else is going through and people might not have any idea what can help them or what can hurt them. I think that the school has to think about the lives of all the students going there and not just some of them.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
391757E8299B,"Statistics have shown that 82% of students, that do extracurricular activities, get better grades and perform better in school. Many schools offer extracurricular activities for their students. There are many different activities that schools offer, that various of students do. They can range from sports, clubs, and etc. Having extracurricular activities required for students is a good idea because it helps with focus, productivity, and learning.

Doing extracurricular activities can keep students focused on school work and on other things. Doing what you are passionate about, for example, music can help you stay focused. After a long day of school, it can be refreshing to just play your instrument or play a game of soccer. Some students might want to do extracurricular activities to be in a better environment, and doing can help. Something could be happening at home or just something that is bothering them, the activities can help take their mind off of it. There are also have clubs that help with homework, which can lower your stress and keep you focused. Getting your homework completed and getting helped by a teacher can help you feel stressed and unfocused at times, so having extracurricular activities can help with that issue.

Doing dances, sports, or maybe a club can be very productive for pupils. Say you have a new years resolution/goal and it's to play a sport or get active. Playing on your school's football team is a great start to a productive year. Homework clubs are also a good place to go, if you want to be productive. You'll be able to finish your homework and projects that you have, without procrastination involved. Staying at school, doing a club can be way more productive then staying home. When you stay home you are more likely to get lazy and get off task but at school you won't have the same resources, to get lazy, for example, a phone or a TV. Being productive is very important, and staying after school can have a big part in it.

Some people think that doing extracurricular activities waste your time and you learn less. However it's the complete opposite, you can learn so much and things you can't learn during school hours. If a student wanted to be a photographer, they could go to photography class. Many students stay after to learn something new and exciting. Schools that also offer clubs to help with homework and classwork can actually help them to learn more in that class. It can teach students topics, they didn't get before. And lastly, you can learn to play a sport. Sports are amazing to learn and once you get good at it, it is extremely fun. Learning new things are super important, without extracurricular activities it would be harder for students to learn topics like sports, dances, and etc.

Our principle has decided that each student at our school need to do at least one extracurricular activity. It will help the students in various of ways, for example, to focus, to be productive, and to learn new things, they may or may not have know. Some good activities that you can take part in is the sports team or the step team, there are lots of things offered after school, that everyone should do!",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
B6E0685C4299,"I believe that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

These are many reasons why I strongly agree that we should do at least one extracurricular activity.

I agree that we should do this because if we do more activities then we can make more friends and we can share things that we like that some of our school friends dont like to do.

I also believe that if we can try something new we share our experience on what we are doing and your friend or someone you know may want to try it to and try new things that they are afraid to do.

Another reason why I think that this is a wonderful idea is because kids need to get out more and do more things outside of school, and when you do that you might meet someone that can help you in the future for your college or for your career.

Another main reason that we should do extracurricular activities is because if we do more stuff that we think is cool or something we love then we all won't be sitting around at home during the summer or over the summer.

If we just work hard on it and we try our best that might be something that you may want to do in college or a career.

We can also have more fun on the weekends or for the summer if you do at least one more extracurricular activities.

You may also be able to go to new places if you do these actives, they may go on trips that can be really fun.

They may also do something fun with the team like go bowling or just doing something fun.

I also strongly agree that we should do that because if we do more stuff then maybe you can become great at it and maybe there might be a chance of you going to college for it or getting a scholarship.

I know that some kids don't want to do a lot of activities and they put all their eggs in one basket but it is also good that they do more than one because if they do then they have more opportunity's for them.

Another reason that I believe that we should do this is because some kids don't want to do things outside of school but the main reason they should do at least one is because some kids don't interact with people at school and they get teased and when they get home they put themselves down so if they have something they can do outside of school they will be more happy to do what they like and see their friends. I think its really important that they do extracurricular activities so they can get out there and meet better people so they can have the best child hood they can have.

I also believe that they should do this is so kids that come from bad homes can try to get away from the negative stuff even if its for an hour some kids just want to get away sometimes, and getting them away from that negative energy can make them do better in school.

I feel like when they do things they love or want try to do it takes their mind off what they are going through even if it's not for that long.

My conclusion is that this is a great idea that we do this so we can meet new people with the same interest that we have.

We can also get ourselves prepared for college and ready for the outside world when we have to do new things just to make sure that they can afford things like clothes, food, shelter, and etc.

I think that this is great because we may do some fun things with your teammates or you may even go to places you never been before.

Those are the reasons why I think it is important that we do at least one activity after school.  ",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
BC0D9F77A3DA,"Extracurricular activities can be a number of things. From sports, to working on the yearbook, and even serving on the student council, there are a lot of things that qualify as extracurricular activities. It is good for everyone to be part of at least one activity to keep them occupied and stay involved with the school. Doing an extracurricular activity has a lot of benefits, and doing an extracurricular activity is doing yourself a favor. Whether it gives you good experience for your future career, helps you develop good leadership and decision-making, or keeps you in shape, the pros of requiring extracurricular activities far outweighs the cons.

One of the extracurricular activities you can choose is playing a sport. Sports help you out in a number of ways. They could help you stay in shape. You can make friends or develop stronger bonds with them. They also can be a lot of fun, and pave way for a future career in that sport. There are lots of sports to choose from, so the options are endless!

Another way to stay involved with your school is to work on the yearbook. The yearbook is made annually by students, and is good to put on your resume if you want a career in photography. Helping out with the yearbook actually helps the school too. If students like the yearbook, they will buy it, which gives the school more money to spend on improving itself. You also get to hang out with friends while working on the yearbook, which is always nice.

If those activities dont appeal to you, you could serve on the student council. Serving on the school council helps develop crucial skills like leadership and decision-making. It is also a very good experience if you want to pursue a career in politics later on in life. The decisions you make while on student council can help out the school a lot. You can improve key areas of the school and make life better for the students who go to the school.

Learning new things about yourself is always good, and extracurricular activities help you do just that. Maybe you're a great hockey player. Maybe you discover a passion for photography you never knew you had by working on the yearbook. Maybe you're actually a great leader. There are so many things you can discover about yourself by participating in extracurricular activities. Things that you would never know about if you didn't try an extracurricular activity.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A8E5BC14F79F,"Extracurricular activities save lives. That is one of the reasons why I agree with mandatory after school activities. Lots of students in recent years have gotten lazy, bored, and unmotivated. Extracurricular activities can help ease these problems by providing a structured environment for students to learn, explore, and have fun. Extracurricular activities will help students overcome problems by giving them something to do, providing for a safe environment, and helping them make new friends and expand their horizons.

Students will benefit from mandatory extracurricular activities because they will given something fun and exciting to do outside of school. This is beneficiary towards the student because it gives them something outside of school that they can fully engage in. For example, many students play lots of video games. This is fine, but what if the students spends half of that time learning how to code video games. That still fuels a student's passion, but also teaches a useful skill that can be used in the future. After school activities push students to learn new things and expand what they do regularly.

Another way mandatory extracurricular activities will help is by providing for a safe environment outside of school. Students who are at risk to gang violence, drugs, and other issues can find refuge in a safe after school environment. Instead of turning to drugs and falling into crime, students will be given the opportunity to work to provide themselves and their families with a better future. For example, a student living in an underprivileged community may be pressured to join a gang, but he likely won't if he is already busy with sports. There will always be outside pressures that these students will face that make it hard to stay true, but pushing them to join an extracurricular activity may help save their lives.

My final reason is that extracurricular activities will help students make new friends and expand their horizons. Making new diverse friends benefits students and teaches them to work with all sorts of different people. After school activities also teach new and valuable life skills that can help you in the future. For example, going to cooking club can help you learn how to cook, so when you are living alone you can save money eating at home. All of these skills will help a student be successful in life and in jobs.

To conclude, mandatory extracurricular activities will benefit students by giving fun activities to do, providing a safe environment, and helping make new friends and teach new skills. These fun activities help students by teaching them stuff, while also fueling passions. The safe environment helps students ignore outside issues and helps them stay out of trouble. Finally, the new friends and skills will help the student learn to work with people and may help them get jobs. Mandatory after school activities are a great solution to many problems, which is why I agree with this solution.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
EDF528C06A8B,"Do you want your kids to suffer from mental distress because they don't know how to properly manage their stress? Seven hours in school all day can be overworking and stressful, kids need something that they can depend on to relieve all that added stress. Weather it's sports,clubs, social activities, etc. students need something that isn't them sitting in a room all day competing to keep their grades up. I think that students should have to be endorsed into doing extracurricular activities because, it can force them to go out and do something other than just sitting there on there phones all day. It teaches them social skills and get's them out of there comfort zone, and by doing this it pushes them to get out of there immediate circle of friends and meet new people.

Making students chose an extra curricular activity increases their chances of getting successful jobs in the future. It teaches them to adapt and change to new environments. In the workplace most jobs will require them to interact with new faces all the time. Fun extra curricular activities just better equips them for that. It also boosts students confidence levels up by making them put themselves out there more than they normally would. Students need the opportunity to get out of their comfort levels and try new things, and after school clubs do just that.

If they were to only stay within their comfort zone they would only be hurting themselves more. They will never get to experience all the trials and errors of trying different things. Who knows they might just discover a new found love or hobby for something that they never would have even thought of before. By stepping out of their house and just trying they are already doing the hardest part.

School is exhausting, your working for hours on end repeating the same lessons over and over doing the same boring thing every day. How could this not effect the mental health of students? They need something to take there mind off of everything. Something to relieve them of all the pilled up stress they have been lifting. After school clubs and sports can not only improve their mental and physical health but it can lift the burden off there shoulders for a moment of the day. It can be a place away from all of their hassle of school work and tests. Mandated extra curricular activities keep kids sane, they are exactly what stressed kids need to get a break from everything.

I strongly agree that making students participate in an extra curricular activity is a great idea. It boosts their social skills and forces them to push themselves and go out beyond what they would normally do. They may not even know it yet but many of these clubs and sports can actually teach them very valuable lessons and tips that can help them for the future. It also gives them something useful to do rather than just watching TV all night. For many kids this can give them something to be apart of, it makes them feel like they belong to something. That can be important, especially to kids with lots of pilling stress that they might not be able to handle. This helps them manage there time, stress, and health better.

7834D569421C,"A lot of kids nowadays do extra curricular activities, but there not for everyone. Kids shouldnt have a extra curricular activity be mandatory. Because students are usually already really busy, they wont get as much rest for the next school day, and parents would have to fit another thing into their schedules. So here is why I believe they shouldnt have a extra activity be mandatory.

For a lot of students, right when they get home, you have homework to do, chores you have to take care of, dinner time and adding another thing onto that would give them barely anytime to do anything they want to. The time they have to do those things vary from person to person, but in the end they wont have much time just to be a kid. Some clubs will vary in time, so if club A takes less time then club B but they like club B better they will either have to do something they dont like, or have less time to do something they would rather be doing. Then because of the up and coming school day tomorrow, they will have to go to bed, even if they just finally finished their homework.

After all of your homework is said and done it will probably already be really late, and a lot of kids will stay up just so they could maybe play a game with their friends for a little bit. But buy then its already pretty late, and then the next morning they have to wake up early just to get to school on time. Having a mandatory activity could make students go to bed much later then they already are going to bed at. Then there grades could drop from them being so tired in class. Getting sleep in is already a problem for many teens, but having another mandatory activity, maybe adding at least an hour to the things they have to do will make them getting to bed that much later.

It may seem like all of this just impacts the kids schedule, but somebody's got to pick them up and sometimes even take them to their activity, and in most cases its their parents. For a lot of parents they have been working all throughout the day and now have to fit in picking up their child into everything else they have to do. Now in some house holds kids do help out quite a bit, but parents still have a lot to do, like preparing dinner, cleaning, sometimes helping with their child's homework, and much more. Sometimes parents dont even get to go home before picking up their kid from their activity or taking them there. So it impacts almost everyone involved.

In conclusion, schools shouldnt have kids be forced into extra curricular activities. They can stress kids out with already having lots to do outside of school, make them more tired with less sleep, and parents having to shove an activity to pick their kids up from into a probably already hectic schedule. Kids and Parents already have a ton to do and a lot they want to do, but if schools shove more things that we have to do, then the things we have to time to do on our want list, gets shorter and shorter with the time we have. So no, please dont force kids to do an extra curricular activity that they may not even want to do.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
A03284A8FF24,"Do you think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity? Extracurricular activities are activities you can take part in after or during school to further advance your mind. Some examples are sports, serving on the student council, or Beta Club. I think these activities are great and should be given to the students in a variety of choices. Here are some reasons supporting my idea.

First of all, extracurricular activities will help the students make a decision on what they want to be in life. If there are a variety of choices the students can try each of them until they find what they like. If they like sports they might want to go to the NFL, NBA, or other professional sports. Or maybe they might like science and become a scientist and discover new things. It's good to have a career that your happy with and enjoy doing.

Second of all, the students will have something to look forward to during the day. They will invest time into something and won't be so careless in life. Some students might be going through things and these activities could help them get it off of their chest. Examples of things like this happening have been heard from professional sports players. They say how their family may have struggled when they were young and sports help them look forward to something in life.

Finally, they will help sharpen the mind of the students and make them into harder workers. This world needs harder workers to go further. Generations have been getting lazier since technology has advanced. The amount of obesity in people have increased and kids don't go outside and play like they used to. If something doesn't change it will only get worse.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities are something that every kid should participate in. First, they will help them find out what they want to be in life. Second, they will give them something to look forward to during the day. Third, they will sharpen the minds of the students and turn them into harder workers. Do you thinks students should participate in these activities?  ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
86A99FA674E5,"I agree with the principal that students should have to do one or more extracurricular activites. If students play sports for the sxhool they attend they could have lots of fun with freinds. Also with more people in diffrent clubs and activities the school could raise alot of money for new things inside the school. With every kid in the school doing activties they could all enjoy seeing other freinds strive towards there goals and do many good things. If the whole school plays for one of their sports teams all of the kids in the school would stay active and healthy.

While playing school sports and clubs the school could raise lots of money and would have to do less fundraising. The students that go to the school could have lots of fun while making money for the school beacause people will often bring in large donations. While people give the school money they could buy better equipment for all of the player and clubs. Like new computers,basketballs and even more thats why I think the school should have atleast every student particioate in one club or sport. Also studies say while your having fun or doing something you enjoy the time goes buy quicker. So all of the students wouldnt be stressed about long practices or club meetings because they wont be worrired about having to raise money and do tons of fund raising.

When playing on a sports team or a club you set goals for yourself and when you are in a great environment you will get to those goals thats why every student should do an activity. In the clubs it should be a stress free place where youm get what you need done in the club and dont how to worry about not having time to do your homework. The sports teams would be great for people who want to try new things like soccer,basketball and even track. Lots of students would be excited for all of the upcoming seasons. If students did a year book club some of the donations would go to new cameras and better yearbook designs. If the whole school played a sport it would just make it a healthy school in general.

If the schools yearbook club had good cameras they could take pictures of all of the sports palyer. Lets say if the sports teams won a championship the yeark book club could take a picture and say championship winners. Scince everyone in the school did asport or a club they could have a fun day at school where they paly games with the leftover money from the donations to buy board games water ballons and even movies. The student council could have a vote on a party or a fun day and that's a great way to teach the council how a demorcracy works. I think its a great idea to have everyone do atleast one extracurricular actvite for the school.

In conclusion I agree with the idea of having everyone do an extra activity after school. The students that will be joining the sports teams will stay active while having fun with their freinds. The yearbook club could help out around the svchool and takempictures for the yearbook and bring in lots of money from people who donate money to the school. The student council could have and election for spots on the council like president vice president and more teaches the students how a demorcracy works.

064E497ED786,"Would you want to do extracurricular activities at your school? If you answered, ""no"" then I understand why. Some students just don't really want to. That is exactly why I feel as if my principal should not decide for all students to do extracurricular activities. All students don't have the time of the day for extracurricular activities. It can put a lot of pressure on a student. Very much unwanted pressure. For some students focusing on school and after school activities is just too much. Everyone has a different way of living. After school activities just aren't always for everybody.

Also, some students may not be available after school. Some may have family members to look out for after school. Honestly, those are the types of things you need to think about before making such a big plan. I feel as if the thoughts of others are no where in the situation. Students sometimes have more important family matters to tend to. Some students could be having an very hard time in their household at the moment. You really never know.

There might be some lucky students in the school who may have jobs. Just like me. I can't always go to after school activities because I have an job to go to. If I don't show up I am not getting paid. Who doesn't like getting money? I know I love getting paid! I also love after school activities. But, everyone isn't the same as me.

In conclusion, I really strongly disagree to that decision. I would highly disappoint myself if I did agree. It just isn't an great plan for the whole school. Different students have different issues to deal with after school. Some may even struggle to get to school in the morning. Students should have the right to decide for themselves if they would like to stay back or not. That is the fair way to go!",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
E96C2AD465F8,"This year I chose Robotics as my extracurricular activity and so far I have had a lot of fun building and programming the robots. It is also a high school level class and it will count off one of my class credits. Next year I am taking cibersecurity, American sign language, I will be on the football team and I will continue doing boy scouts. (I don't know if that last one actually counts) These extracurricular activities will help me on my path to graduating and help me get a job that I want. I think extracurricular activities are a helpful way to get students involved and I think that we should make every student take at least one activity.

Right off the bat I can say that football will keep you fit and in good health and that is something that I think ever person should be in. In scouts I pick up trash and follow the scout oath to try to be a better citizen in our community. I love both of those and they are very fun to me and I enjoy trying to get better and better at them. It's the off season right now which isn't an excuse but I haven't been doing all the workouts I should to keep the conditioning that I was in but I am still in pretty good condition. As for scouts we do hikes and over this summer we are going west and hiking for one to two weeks so most weekends I hike to make sure I am in shape to hike for days on end. I love exercise and it is a vital part of my life. Thats why I like the sports aspect of extracurricular activities and scouts is just an additive that I enjoy.

At the moment I am only doing robotics as my in school activity this year which is a great way to scratch the surface of coding and learning how to completely assemble a robot. Now if I want to go do something with coding I know the basics and I would understand more of what I was doing. I love building things so the assembly part of robotics is my favorite. I love working with my hands and building something from nothing. As I said I will be taking cibersecurity which I actually know nothing about but I've heard good things about it and so it intrigues me. Before I mentioned that I love working with my hands which is exactly why I want to take ASL because then I am taking a language which is a high school requirement for getting an advanced degree from high school but I will also be able to work with my hands and if I ever need to help some one who is deaf I hopefully will be able to talk to them and figure it out with them.

Now I know what you're thinking, ""W

hat if we don't want to take the extracurricular activity!""

Well then to bad! You should at least try something because there are a lot of classes in high school that you can take and there might be one that you find to really enjoy! Besides it's good for you and you need it for your diploma. Now you could argue again and say that, ""

I would have more time in my day to do homework and other stuff!""

That is technically true but an hour and thirty minutes wouldn't make that big of a difference! Just use your resource or study hall time wisely

I think extracurricular activities really help and contribute to your learning. From my experience it has and I really have enjoyed taking them. If everyone took just one extracurricular activity then they would know more and have a better chance to spread out and search and find what they really like and want to do.

In my case I love playing sports so much, my biggest favorite sport is soccer, and I love it!! I think it would be woderful that our school principal decides to add a soccer activity afterschool, even tho you can run, get tired, and sweat alot by playing soccer. Soccer could be one of the best way to workout your muscles and body. And not just that, it could be one of the best ways to developed your brain, and the best way to give your brain a break from school things, such as math, science, art, mucic,civics,english,strings,etc.

As I said before, it's a great idea to have afterschool activies or in school activities. ""wow"". what a great way to unstress yourselves out after a long and tired day of school. Lately, most people, and student's stay after school to do an activity, but not all of the students participate in at least one activity after school or in school, some don't participate because they're parent's don't give them permission to stay after school, for at least 2 hours.

I think that parents, should give permission to their kids to stay afterschool and participate in at least one activity. It will be awesome that all students participate in an activity, even if you don't know how to play a sport or any other activities, you can learn as time goes through, you can learn by looking at other student's examples, over ad over and over again! yet I think that adding after school or in school activities, is a good way to get to know other students from different grade levels or further more, get to know different teacher's in our school, that we don't talk to, or don't get along with. By joining in afterschool or in school activities you can easily get along with other people, and who knows you can become friends or even better best friends.

As some people do this activities or play sports, others can volunteer to help in school, in whatever teacher's need help in. For example, others could work on keeping the school clean.

furthermore instead of having just sports activities, we should, or in other words the principal should decide to add more new school activities, like I said helping in school. My question is how can I help in school? well you can help in school for example,by helping the school clean. but in what ways ca I keep school clean? well one example is by keeping the school organized and neat. while other students could do other things, for example, students could participate in picking up trash that other student live during school hours.

Others can participate in keeping things organized in school such as keeping the library clean, by organizing the books by categories or by the authors, this way all students could colaborate to keep our school clean. Students should be able to colaborate in at least one thing, that way if all students colaborate and volunteer in this great idea, our school will look more organized and wonderful, not just from the outside, but from the inside too, because that way visitors or even our parent's who come to school sometimes, can notice how great our school looks like, because how our school looks like, tells other people alot about our school.

Students in our school are so helpful, as teacher's are too, our school has alot of wonderful, helpful and smart students. In my opinion I think that teachers or students cannot change the whole world, but we can change at least our school. We can make our school in to a better school, in to a a wonderful and nice school, even tho others made not like the idea of having extracurricular activities. Indo think we should have extracurricular activities,afterschool. Sometimes after a long day of school, I go home tired and bored. In my opinion that's why we should do afterschool or inschool activities, so when school ends, we can go home happy and not tired. As I said before, sports is a good way to end school and go home happy. All activities, doesn't matter if is in school or afterschool can help you alot, it entertains you and helps you take a break from school. When school ends, some people are bored, tired, sleepy, mad, sad, depressed, etc, but if our school principal adds new activities after or in school, those students that are sad, mad, depressed or tired after school, can go home happy and with a positive attitude.

Overall, in conclusion I do agree with our school principal's idea. I think teacher's and parent's should vote too, so we can have more new activities, so we can have in school or after school activities. Lets help our school! students!! Let's help teacher's and our principal decide, that way we will have new activities to do, in school and afterschool. Let's keep our school clean, beautiful, organized and a safe place to be in. Let's help our school look awesome, so when visitors come, or our parent's come to visit our school, they can say positive things and not negative things about our school. Let's be the awesome students we have always being, and I encourage you to join in our after school activities, that way we can always be happy and have a positive attitude.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
AC523741D5A0,"How would you feel if you were required to participate in an extracurricular activity whether you wanted to or not? I believe that students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity unless they want to do so, therefore I disagree with the idea of students being required to participate in an extracurricular activity. Students should have the freedom to decide whether they want or don't want to be apart of an extracurricular activity.

First of all, I believe that students should have the ability to participate or to not participate in an extracurricular activity. I believe this because a lot of students may already be apart of extracurricular activities outside of school such as sports, music, dance, gymnastics, etc and having to participate in a school extracurricular activity could possibly get in the way of those activities taken outside of school, which could cause there to be no time for students extracurricular activities of choice. Which would be unfair if students would not be able to participate in what they actually want to do outside of school because of the required extracurricular school activity.

Another reason I disagree with this idea is because some students might not like to be apart of an extracurr-

icular school activities. Some students prefer to stay at home. I definitely have had times were I didnt want to participate in any extracurricular activities outside of school or apart of school for the reasons of school work already being a lot, watching my younger siblings, and just being a homebody. Also if I'm being honest a lot of students are just lazy and they don't want to be apart of anything they just want stay home, which is understandable. As well as some students may struggle with social anxiety and being apart of activities that require having to talk and socialize can be scary at times. I know that I've struggled with social anxiety and it can be really scary, and you just freeze up because your terrified of doing something wrong and that everyone will judge you. Also some students just may not be interested in participating in a extracurricular activity, they may not like any of the activities that are being offered so, it would be forcing students to do something that they do not want to do or be apart of.

Lastly another reason I disagree is because some students have their own responsibilities from home for example they might have parents/guardians that may be or do work late, so some students may need to watch younger siblings, clean the house, take out the trash, figure out what they will eat for dinner, go to their own extracurricular activity if they have one, get their school work done, etc. The list could go on and on. Therefore being required to participate in a extracurricular school activity could get in the way of getting those tasks done.

In conclusion, I disagree with the idea of requiring students to participate in extracurricular school activities. I believe this because it would be taking away students free time to participate in their own extracurricular activities, it would be forcing students who prefer to not do extracurricular activities to do extracurricular activities, and it would get in the way of students getting their own responsibilities done. So that is why I believe that students should have the freedom to participate or to not participate in extracurricular activities.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
B567AD10DA07,"""You could be the smartest kid in the world, but if all you do is study, then no collage will want you!"" This advise from my mom is truly one of the most important things she said to my brother when he was applying to collage, because it is really true. The decision to have all students do at least one extra curricular is the right choice because students will get opportunities they never would have gotten, and the friendships that will last a lifetime!

Without joining after school clubs, I would have never gotten the opportunities I did. When I joined a competitive dance team, I never thought I would get the chance to learn from professional dancers. As my mom drove along the road to my dance convention, I thought about who I would see, and what dances we would learn. When we got to the location, I hopped out of the car and went through the big, metal doors. I looked around and was absolutely shocked. I saw my dance idol, Generic_Name! Her classes were amazing and if I never joined the dance team, I would never have gotten the opportunity to learn from a professional. Though parents and students may be reluctant, it is overall better if minors do extra curricular activities. There are so many things that come out of doing sports, yearbook, or even if students just do the math club! Each one provides lots of benefits. Studies show students who do one or more activities outside from school do far better than those who don't. Speaking of school, doing clubs after school programs help you in school as well!

My brother joined a programming club in 9th grade, and continued to do it every year. This club helped him understand the material he learned in his computer science class, and he excelled in it. This club helped him realize he loved programming, too. Recently, he got a letter from his dream collage, and they accepted him with a scholarship! If he never joined, he might not have been accepted or not gotten a scholarship to that collage. If teenagers don't sign up for clubs, they will miss out on amazing chances.

Friends that teenager's make in after school programs, could last for years! I've met some of my best friends through my extra curricular, dance. They don't even go to the same school as me! It started when we all were in the same ballet class, and we clicked. I would never have met them if it wasn't for doing dance. Adolescents need to make friends in order to live happily. Some teenagers might have a bad reputation at school, consequently, nobody wants to be friends with them. Luckily for them, most extra curricular activities take place outside of school. Nobody would know about their reputation, so they can start out fresh. Adolescents might even meet their future maid of honor! My mom met her Maid of Honor through a sewing club. Originally, my mom never wanted to do this club, but her mother made her. She was very reluctant the first few times, but started talking to another girl, Generic_Name. Overtime, they became very close and stayed friends throughout high school, and collage. When my mom was planning her wedding, she thought of her best friend, Generic_Name, to be her Maid of Honor. To this day, they are still best friends and it all started in a sewing club! Remember that all the friends kids meet in clubs, could last them into their golden years.

The principle is making the right decision to enforce this policy because it is providing students with countless opportunities and chances to meet their best friends! Remember, the next time a child asks to do a club, always say yes! ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
9C5094D91192,"Do you enjoy school? Students, ages 5 through 18, have to go to school. Though not all kids may enjoy it. So, how can schools make it more enjoyable for students? Having students participate in extracurricular activities would make school more enjoyable because they can hang out with friends, do something they enjoy, and can prepare for college.

Being social is important. Some kids may not have the time to hang out with their friends outside of school. Participating in extracurricular activities would give students time to hang out with their friends. Some extracurricular activities, such as sports, are enjoyable ways to spend time with friends. Other extracurricular activities, like clubs and working on projects for the school, are also fun ways to spend time with your friends and be social.

Doing something you like is also important. You wouldn't want to only spend your time doing something that you do not like and find boring. Extracurricular activities would give you a chance to do something you enjoy. There are many different types of extracurricular activities you can choose from. Sports and clubs are some of these fun extracurricular activities given by your school. By choosing one of these extracurricular activities you will definitely find something that you will enjoy.

It's important to learn and prepare for the life ahead of you. It's also important to prepare for college. Though not all students may want to prepare for their future, most students probably want to. Through extracurricular activities, students who want to prepare for their future can. Some of the extracurricular activities could be classes that help students learn about an occupation they might want to pursue. While other classes could be a way to learn about making a difference in the world.

School principals should have students participate in extracurricular activities to make school more enjoyable. There are many ways to enjoy school through extracurricular activities, such as hanging out with friends, doing something you enjoy, and preparing for college. Extracurricular activities makes it a fun way to be social and hang out with your friends. Doing something you enjoy, such as drawing or sports, is important. But most importantly, preparing for college at an early age will make you successful in life.        ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
906B27CFFFA0,"Do you agree with the princable about. Evrey student must particapait in at least one of these three things. Number one they must paly a school sport,They can be a yearbook desiner,or a school counclier. Well I am going to go in more depth and explaine the jobs to you.

I am going to exblaine each job that the princable requires us to do. The first one is sports such as baseball,softball,basketball,track but thoses sports could be hard for some people that have. Autisum they are not capable to run,or just a mintale illness. so I am going to have to dissagree with the sports because not all the members of the school can do it.

Second thing is they could take place in a yearbook club to rplace a related art or a sport! I am going to explaine what a yearbook club dose So a yearbook club has many things to do the main thing is they can go in anddesine our school year book! There job can get hard because they take there time and effort to make our yearbokk look perfect! All in all I feel like everyone could do this club beacuse it dose not take that much effort and time or running or athtisume.

Last but not least school conciol. The school counciol does a lot of things here are a few. They can help around the school such as help people work threw there problems. They can go to gideness more and help with them. Oh and this is a big one when the 5th graders come over to tour the middle school. There incharge beacuase there the school councle. All in all i think this would be a fun job that everyone could particpate in.

OK so let me ask you gain to you agree or dissagree after all those statments? I am going to have to agree because of the last two I really feel like a lot of people could do that plus it would be fun for all the people with disablitys to learn and get closer with students do you??",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
7C3D428E13BC,"As a student have you ever been asked to do an extracurricular activities like sports. I think that this is a good idea because it can help student to try something new. There is a a lot more reasons that this is a good idea.

Some kids might want to serve on student council. They could make a change to there school that needs to be done. They can change how to the school operates to make it easier for the students and the teachers. The kids could make a change to the school that they think that should be made all around the world and that could influence other schools to do that do.

Doing these activities could help students to be more social with their peers. Some kids dont go outside and hangout with their peers they would rather be inside playing video games. So by doing these activities it could let them see the other side of the world that is fun and more enjoyable. They could meet new people and make new friends.

The activities could help student try something new and learn from it. Like a kid could play baseball for the first time and love it. He could make a career out of it if he wanted to. Not a lot of kids are able to try something new maybe because their parents don't have time to take them to the park. Maybe they dont live close to their friends to play baseball with.

So next time that your school ask you to join in an extracurricular activity. Think of it as a good idea and not a bad one because it could help other student that might need the time.

DAAB3F3226B7,"I strongly disagree. Because students should focus on there education not on yearbook or on some other activities at school.

I agree that sports keep as fit and healthy. But is sport worth as our education? NO! right then why do you guys want's as to participate in sports, making the yearbook,or other activities like this. WHY? if we give more time to sports or other activities our education can fall back our grades can drop down.

Teachers and parents want work from as is we give time to other activities at school then we won't have much time for our homework,projects, and our tests. When we ask the teachers do you accept late work they say no. This is when we say no to other activities at school. Because if they do not accept late work then we have to do it on time it's due to get better grads.

Just focus on your education and move on you can do sports later in life but you can't de educated later. This is your time learn something be something.

6761F7EC5A94,"Do you knw what would be absolutly great? Well youÃÂ´re probably thinking of hundreds of things, but I know what didnÃÂ´t cross your mind and that is participating in extracurricular activities. Participating in at least one of these can change your life and should be mandatory.

Extracurricular activities should be mandatory because of two words ÃÂ¨The FutureÃÂ¨. Going to school is all about bettering your future. So what is a better way then having a extracurricular activity that you participate in? Besides being rich there is nothing and IÃÂ´m going to tell you why. One way itÃÂ´s better is it just gives you more things to put on a job application. The extracurricular also make colleges notice you more and can lead to many colleges wanting you to be at their school so everything will be paid for.

The Last reason I think a extracurricular activity should be mandatory is to work on students management skills.

Being in a extracurricular you would need to know how to find time for homework, studying, spending time with your family,and etc. Budgeting time is a skill you would need as you grow up no matter what you grow up to be or do. Considering that, learning how to at a young age makes it easier when you need to buget time the most.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities helps you better your life and effects your future to certain levels that could make your life better if you just do it. So make sure you get involved cause you would regret it later.     ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
FE1E8BC27781,"After some thought, my principal has decided that all students must be involved in at least one extracurricular activity. For example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or be in the student council. I disagree with his decision because students should be able to choose what to do with their time, and students could have other important affairs or activities in their personal life.

Students should be able to handle the responsibility of managing what they do after school, and in their own time. For example, if students were busy with homework or clubs, they would have almost no free time after school. Time put aside to relax or have fun is just as important as doing school work. Additionally, extracurricular activities are generally optional, so students should have the choice whether to participate or not. While encouraging involvement in extra activities is good, there are other ways to increase participation than forcing students to do so, like putting up fliers or increasing interest.

In addition to this, I believe students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity because they could have important affairs in their personal life. Having to take care of a younger sibling, for example, or working at a part-time job. Even a sick family member is a possible reason to turn down an extracurricular activity, among others. Everyone has different circumstances; hence, it would be inconsiderate and nearly prudish to decide that every student must participate in an extracurricular activity.

In conclusion, I disagree with the principal's decision that students are required to participate in an after-school activity as it would be unfair to the students.. If students do not want to participate, they should not be forced, and we should be able to choose what to do with our time. In addition to this, students could have other things to do in their personal time than that related to school. Therefore, I oppose the principal's decision. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
8172F9426183,"Do you feel like students should be in extracurricular activities?

Extracurricular activities is a good thing to do in my opinion because students can take time out of there day to do something that they can be involved with.

What I think about extracurricular activities is that, it is a safe learning environment because students can learn how to do things they haven't learned how to do yet.

I like to do extracurricular activities because I like to make new friends and learn how to do things better.

I agree that your principal should let all students participate in extracurricular activities because students can meet new friends, students can feel more involved, and students can learn and improve from all of these activities.

My first reason why students should be involved in extracurricular activities is because students can meet new friends.

Students can meet new friends by doing something they like with other people that like that activity too.

Sometimes it can be difficult to make new friends when others might just not like to be with you but, that's why there is more people in that same group with you.

I can easily make friends with someone because I like to feel more involved with everyone else and I hope you do to.

Making friends during these extracurricular activities can improve your own social skills in how to talk to people and how people talk to you.

My second reason why students should be in extracurricular activities is because students should feel more involved with what they are doing.

Students can feel more involved by feeling confident in what they choose to do.

It takes a lot of effort into being so confident in what you do because you can easily second guess your thought or you can be wrong but you just don't realize it.

Being involved can be difficult because some people disagree with what you do and they just won't let you in because they don't enjoy you but, that's why you have friends to support you in what you believe in.

I believe that being involved in extracurricular activities is easier because other people can like your decision, or they can disagree with you and that's why you got to support your own statement.

My third and final reason why students should be in extracurricular activities is because you can learn and improve how to do these activities.

Learning and improving from these activities can help you in the future because your job or anything like that can involve one of those activities that you learned a while back.

Students can learn and improve from extracurricular activities by being interested in them and by doing that activity that they really enjoy.

I would like to do different activities because I would want to learn something I didn't know how to do and you can do that to.

I would like for you to do other activities because you can learn a lot of different things you didn't know about that extracurricular activity.

Students can really change from extracurricular activities because they can learn something new and improve from that activity.

In conclusion,

I think that your principal should let all students participate in one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, students can feel more involved, and students can learn and improve from all these activities. Students making new friends is a really important thing because it helps with there self-esteem and how they live there own life.

Being more Involved is also important because it is good to put your own personal opinion out there for them to hear.

Students can learn and improve from extracurricular activities by enjoying what they do and doing it at there best effort.

That is why I think that your principal should let all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
6120612BAC0D,"I think that you can work on or do anything that you want to do. I agree that you can do any one of the activities that you want to do, because you get time indoors or outdoors. So i agree.

1. So if you wanted to play a sport you can just do that thing first before you do the other activities.

Do you favorite activity first and then do the other.

Do the one that is easier.

Do the one that makes more since to you.

2. If you wanted to work on doing a yearbook.

Have help on doing it.

Work at your own paste.

Set everything up right.

3. If you get called on a student council you probably have to do it.

Do you best on trying it.

Pay attention and dont mess around.

Dont laugh or make much noise.

I agree that you should have activities for school because you are getting exercise from walking and running around inside and outside. Then if you stay inside and outside everyday then you could have a better chase of make the team for whatever sport you are trying out for.

If you want to just do one activity or sport then choose your own one to do. Like I would pick sports because I really like baseball and I also play baseball. Play at the position that you would usually play at. Also try to go in the order you think is the easiest. do the one that makes more since to you so if you play shortstop and you also play pitcher then take turns at both of the positions. Do which one is the best for you to do or play.

If you wanted to work on a yearbook. Ask for help on it raise your hand so that someone can help you do it or understand it. Work at your own paste do what the teacher asked you to do and if someone else tried to mess you up just say no that is no going to go very well for you. Set all of the paper for it up right so that it would go well for you and it would also be easy for you. Also try your very best to do good on it and try to get a good grade on it.

If you get called up for doing the students council you will probably have to do it. You would have to do your best and try to get a good grade on it. Pay attention in class and dont mess around. You might get in trouble or get a lunch detention. Dont laugh or make noise while the students council is going on because you might get in trouble you might have to sit out and not be able to do it and you could get a phone call home which would no be to good.

So if anyone would choose between sports,yearbooks, or student counseling what would you do! I know that I would pick sports because I play a sport and the sport I play is baseball. I am always at my practices, I am always there on time. And since i am always there I am getting better each and everyday I go to my practices. So if I were to pick an activity to do it would be sports because i play baseball.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
7B4DD08B4A67,"Stress, work, jobs and injuries. Some students have all of that on their shoulders: responsibilities that they need to take care of in, and outside of school. Students can't always focus on academic studies, or activities. They have other things to do, like babysitting a child, working a job, healing themselves physically and mentally. Therefore, students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Students, just like some adults, have things they need to do after their 'job' is over. These things include working a job, picking up a sibling from school, or running errands for their guardians. And even if students didn't have anything thing to do after the last bell of the day rings, they shouldn't have to stay long. It should be the students choice to what they want to do, whether it's just to go home and relax, or go out with friends. School generally limits our free time and social time. Therefore, students shouldn't be force to limit their seven to eight, or more, hours of time they have to do what they want.

Besides not having time to do what students want, there's stress. Stress is like a child kicking over an anthill. It takes students long to become stress free, and stress randomly comes at times. Whether that random stress is studying for a test or class, worrying about keeping up grades, and doing homework on time. So the last thing a student needs is a child, stress, destroying their anthill. Basically what I'm saying is that requiring students participation in extracurricular activities will overflow students with stress, and eventually, they might become too overwhelmed. The mind is a fragile thing, and should be taken care of with care, just like the body. Students can't do certain activities if their body is injured. And for the some activities that they can do, the student just may want to heal fully instead of jumping back into school and receiving more stress. With that, students should decide what they want to do.

Extracurricular activities will benefit students, that is what some people may say. While I do agree some extracurricular activities will benefit students who choose to be apart of it, it may not do good for others. What good would it do for you to be apart of something that your hearts not in? Yes, it's nice to experience new things, but some experiences aren't for some people. Besides that, students have a life outside of school. They can't be expected to have school as their only responsibility. They have things that need to be done, and things they want to do. With that in mind, the students who want to be apart of after school activities should, and those who don't shouldn't have too.

Opportunities are a great thing for students, but those opportunities shouldn't be required of students to take them without any choice at all. Students have tons of responsibilities they need to attend to either way. Therefore, more stress is unneeded in the long run. In conclusion, students have a lot to stress about, free time they want, injuries to heal, jobs to be worked. So please consider the idea that students shouldn't be forced into doing extracurricular activities when it could hinder them.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
2D8D731895EF,"I felt excitement swell in my chest as I stepped up to the plate, batting for my school's softball team. My teammates' cheers mixed with the chatter in the stands, creating a joyful sensation deep inside of me unique to this moment. That instant, I knew that playing softball for the school had been a wonderful decision. If other people had not encouraged me to participate in this activity, though, I never would have tried out for the team. I agree with the principal's decision to require students to participate in extracurricular activities because they prepare students for the future, allow students to have new experiences, and encourage school spirit.

The first reason it is a good idea to make extracurricular activities a requirement is because they prepare students for the future. In many occupations, teamwork is vital in order to become a success. Extracurricular activities require the same sort of teamwork in order to meet the goals of the group. For example, you must work as a team to win in sports, and it is important play to the strengths of each individual in your group if you want to create a high-quality yearbook. Along with this, extracurricular activities build strong work ethic in participants. My father played sports all throughout his high school career. He says that when he had other people on his team relying on him, his work ethic naturally increased because he didn't want to disappoint his peers. These words ring true for any group activity. When students participate extracurricular activities, which usually require group work, they will gain work ethic to carry all the way to their future jobs. These activities are definitely a necessary requirement in schools because they help a student can gain work ethic and teamwork skills that will aid them in the future.

In addition, a mandatory extracurricular activity encourages students to branch out and try something new that they may come to love. I am a living example of this. Before this school year, I dreaded participating in any form of a performance in front of anyone. When I stood onstage, my stomach twisted into knots, my knees shook, and my palms became slippery with sweat. It was torture! After participating in my school's extracurricular choir program, though, I learned to push past my initial fear of performing and enjoy it. Now, thanks to this activity, I find being on stage and entertaining exciting and enjoyable. As you can see, new activities are a chance to learn and grow. In an activity that they've never tried before, a student can find a passion they didn't even know they had! Many people won't try something new on their own, though, so making extracurricular activities mandatory would be a smart way to encourage students to embrace a new opportunity.

Finally, requiring a school-based extracurricular activity is important because it builds school spirit in the student body. Imagine the star player on the school basketball team standing at the free throw line. A hush falls over the crowd as he bounces the ball once, twice. The ball then leaves his hands and sails through the air, landing in the basket with a perfect swish . The crowd roars, waving hand-painted signs provided by the student council and chanting the player's name. Now imagine if that player hadn't joined the team. Imagine if no one at all wanted to join the team, or if there were no excited students at the game to cheer and wave their signs. This moment could never have happened if no one was there to participate in extracurricular activities. As a result, there would be far less school spirit. Like sports, clubs, yearbook committees, and other groups of that sort generate school spirit. When a group of students work together to accomplish something, such as painting a school mural or publishing a yearbook, the students feel a sense of pride in what they have done, and everyone who sees their work feels that same school spirit. This is a sensation that can't be felt in a regular core class. It happens when students band together outside of the regular classroom to do something special. If everyone were required to participate in an extracurricular activity, this sense of school spirit and pride would surge through the entire student body, filling every student.

When extracurricular activities are mandatory for students, so much can be gained. I support the principal's decision to require every student to participate in something extracurricular because these activities prepare students for the future, encourage students to gain new experiences, and build school spirit. If only a few willing students participate in extracurricular activities, these benefits can't take place for everyone, so we must allow these activities to be made mandatory.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
A3636EF8A9CA,"why should students be able to chose if the want to do a extracurricular or not?

I desagree with the principle because no one schould make you do something that you don't want to do for anyreason at all. In my old school we had a lot of extracurricular classes that we could join, like honors chores, french club, sports, sert team witch was a recycling team so we could help to recycle, year book, music, and others. I decided to join three sert team, french club the french club it was about cooking and backing french foods, and honors chores witch you had to pass tryouts to join, I passed and joined, the best part of all this was that no one told me I had to join one without me wanting to join it, so that made me fell happy and better that i could chose to do it or to not do it. This year a new school, new house, new family (step dad and stepbrother) so i didn,t really want to join any after school things, but thought the whole entire summer my step dad said the me and my brother had to join or a sport or whatever after school, me and my brother desagreeded and said that we didn't want to, and my mom taking his side said that we had to join one, since me and my brother didn't chose one he chose one for us tykando because that's what his son does, since we had to do it that made me fell a type of anger because someone was making me do something that I didn't want to do me and my brother ended up quitting.

No one should tell anyone they must do something that they don't want to unless that thing is going to save your life or help someone else. If you want to join any extracurricular go for it but if you don't want to than you don't have to,

I disagree with the principle because you should not have to do something that you don't want to do the principle can't make you do a extracurricular.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
1B2083B9F74C,"Extracurricular activities are more important than you think. Extracurricular activities play a huge part to get you involved with things. They serve as experience, and proof that we can learn more beyond what we are regularly taught in school. If a principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, it would be a good decision. Participating in extra curricular activities help people get into collage, opens people up to socialize, and benefit you for the rest of your life.

Firstly, times are changing now. People are starting to develop new interests. Especially teenagers. That means schools adapt to the students interests by adding more extracurricular activities. Collages are starting to notice that students are beginning to take on this trend, and now begin to focus more on students personal interest and personality, than the students making straight A's. Students can really find and express themselves and their passions with extracurricular activities. Classes like; art, music, theater, and technology are all examples of extra curricular classes. Clubs and sports are examples of extracurricular activities. Taking participation in all of these types of activities will show up again when you apply for collage. The reason why is because they can bring out the real you, and that is what collages want to see. They don't care that you know how to solve an inequality. They want you if you care about whats beyond what school tells you to learn. That is how extracurricular activities can play a part in getting you into collage.

Now, a lot of people tend to be introverted due to the lack of communication. Maybe they can't find people with the same interest as them. Joining clubs, or playing sports can help you find people you could possibly feel more comfortable opening up to. The more you talk to new people, the more confidence you gain to socialize. Social skills are really important too. They are practically used throughout your whole life. Taking part in extracurricular activities will not only help you open up to socialize more, but will also benefit your future. This brings me onto my next point.

Extracurricular activities will benefit you for the rest of your life. They can help you learn skills you won't learn on a daily bases. When you part take in an extracurricular activity, you are exposed to having to work with new people, problem solve, think flexible, and many more situations all varying on what you are doing. You will re encounter those times again in life. In the future, students will be getting jobs, and having to solve their own problems. Practicing handling those moments in life will help you. Like I mentioned before, having social skills is very important. This will help you be better at your job. Lets say a student joined the student council. They are coming across problems they need to solve to make their school better. They've also must think outside the box. Constantly practicing those skills will help you in life.

Extracurricular activities should be highly recommended to try in school. They can help people get into collage, open people up to socialize, and can help you in life. Students may think it controlling of a principal to make them participate in an extracurricular activity however, they should think ahead of time and realize it is actually helping them.                                      ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
80905F810672,"Students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities if they do not want to. Some students have disabilities which prohibit them from doing these activities, are not interested, or do not have the time. If they feel that they do not need to perform the extracurricular activities provided by the school, then staff members should not force it upon them. The requirement is unreasonable and should not be put into effect.

Some students cannot participate in these activities because they are physically or mentally prohibited by a disability. They need special care that they will not be able to receive if the school puts the new requirement into effect. Asking them to perform these activities is a step too big for them to take. Many of these students already have difficulty in school, and if the school forces them to take an extracurricular activity, their time at school would become even more difficult. The school cannot ask too much of these students, as they are doing what they can to improve. There are better ways to help students with disabilities, rather than expecting them to perform activities that they cannot.

Other students do not have interest in the extracurricular activities that the school provides. They have activities that they can perform outside of school. Their time outside of school is important, as it gives them freedom to do what they want. Perhaps they would prefer horseback riding or extreme sports, but the school clearly cannot provide these for them. Students can choose from a wider variety of extracurricular activities outside of what the school gives to them. When students get ready for college, activities outside of school will help them decide what path they want to take. They should be able to pursue their own career paths without being held back. They are unique, and their creativity should be embraced.

They should be the ones to choose if they want to participate in the activities the school provides, not the principal.

A large percentage of students in the United States say that they have too much homework, or they have responsibilities outside of school. Requiring them to add another thing to worry about would likely cause stress and lack of sleep. Many students already do not receive the recommended eight hours of sleep, and another extracurricular activity will not help their cause. Too many responsibilities causes the brain to release a stress hormone, which can have devastating effects on a person's thought process and physical health. If a student cannot think clearly because of stress, their grades will go down and they will not succeed. With too much stress, a person can become tired and irritable. This irritability would cause the general mental health of the school to decrease. Though some students will benefit from having another extracurricular activity, most will not.

If the principal decides to go through with this plan, then the growth of the students will be stunted. Adding this requirement will not help the students who have disabilities or those who have responsibilities to do after school. It is not the school's job to dictate whether students participate in the school's extracurricular activities or those that are provided by other programs. The school should be doing their best to help the students, not put another weight on their shoulders.     ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
04B4209D8A34,"You may like soccer, art, or even debate. The possibilities are endless to any activity that you could join at your school. Extracurricular activities are important to every school. Though every school has different activities, each and every one of them play a key role. Students may wonder why their principal would make them have to stay after a long day of learning. Students may think that extracurricular activities aren't interesting, but they may not realize how many options their school has to offer. Our principal should start putting up sheets that inform you on what activities we have and a brief explanation about them. I agree that it should be mandatory for all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will be involved in their school, they will make friends, and they could enjoy it.

Students should always feel involved in their school. Every student matters and can make a difference. A good way to be involved at school is to join an extracurricular activity. For example, if someone joined the SCA then they would be involved by organizing school dances and events. Giving ideas to the student council is another way to be a part of your school. Say you thought that the dress code needed to be adjusted, you could join a club and talk about it. These clubs can be used to spread awareness for bullying. Someone could of been bullied and they want to feel part of something so they join a club for bullying awareness. Students should encourage others to be part of something at their school. There are numerous ways to be involved at your school, all you need to do is put yourself out there.

Joining an extracurricular activity is a great way to make new friends, because you get to meet people that you would of never talked to if you didn't join that club. If you are generally a shy person then a club or sports team will help you meet new people. For instance, if you get on a sports team you and your team will become one big family. You all will work together during games which will create a bond. Another example is if you join an art club you will have something to talk about because you both will like art. Sometimes it can be hard to open up to people and make friends but trust me doing an activity will help that tremendously. When I first joined JV soccer I was really intimidated by all the big kids, but then I talked to them and they seemed really nice and talked to me. This goes to show that extracurricular activities can help you make friends that you would of never made if you didn't join that club.

Another important reason to join a club is that you could actually really enjoy it. Even if you have no experience with an of the choices, but it sounds interesting to you then you should go for it. Trying out new things is good and you never know how good you'll be at it. If you try photography for the first time you could like it so much that you do it again next year. Also, you could join the tennis team and realize that you're really good at it and end up becoming a famous tennis player. However, not everyone is going to like the choices that they have. Well, our school could have an option that students get to create a club that they would like. This solves the problem because other students could like the same thing as their peers so they would want to join that club. Someone could want to create a club for ROTC and another student may want to be in the military so they join that club. Instead of joining a random club because you have to, try to actually find one that you enjoy. There are many choices for students because the principal want everyone to be able to do an activity that they like.

Extracurricular activities provide lots of opportunities for students. You will make lots of memories and friends from joining these clubs. Many students have joined activities and enjoyed being involved so they kept doing that same club every year.

However, some students may find it rude to be forced to do an activity. We have homework and activities outside of school ,so why do we have to stay at school for an extra hour? In order to make everyone agree with the idea of having to participate in a club we have to fix the problems. Yes, students have homework to do, so we can have each club have a specific day of the week to prevent students from staying after everyday. Another issue is what if parents can't pick up their child? Then in that case the school will provide transportation from the school to the students bus stop. There is no reason why students shouldn't join clubs. Activities at your school can help you be involved, make friends, and you could enjoy the club. This is why I agree that students should have to at least participate in one extracurricular activity.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
4A28DE0DB485,"Paint a picture in your head, imagine if students did not want to participate in an extracurricular activity, and were not trying to improve their quality of life or them as a person, this is why students should participate in an extracurricular activity because it can benefit them, based on my experiences in life. I am convinced that extracurricular activities can do good, in general, when it comes to you as a person and your quality of life. Students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they can be more social, learn more, and be more productive.

Students will be more social, in general, because it would make them new friends. In my life, I participated in extracurricular activities and I have built positive long-lasting friendships, and it made me a better person. It would benefit the community because being social with others builds good friendships, and improves you as a person as well. It would build a better community as a whole, and you as a person in my opinion.

Students can also learn more and build new skills. In my life, I participated in an extracurricular activity which involves swimming, and I have learned skills that can save my life, and prevent me from drowning in a real-life situation. It can be important to learn a new skill, especially a skill that can save ones life. This is one essential experience in my life on why I agree students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Students may also be more productive and get their work completed. In my life, it has inspired me to pursue my dreams, and study in the medical field because one specific extracurricular activity has taught me some important life-saving skills. It inspires me to get my work done, always doing my best, and not giving up.

All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can learn essential skills, be more social and productive as well. Being more social with others can build better long-lasting friendships, and you can also learn new skills which can be essential in life, it can also inspire you to get your work done.

6A67C3F51562,"Extracurricular activities can be a fun after school experience for students. While extracurricular's are a fun experience, I do not think they should be forced onto students. Three reasons extracurricular's should not be forced include, A lack of interest, not having enough time, and extracurricular's could hurt students school performance. I personally enjoy after school activities, but some students may be effected by them more than others.

First off, Students having a lack of interest in what their doing. When people are forced to do things they have no interest in doing their work is effected. Not to mention that they often work in groups with other people so their work is effected too. The people who really enjoy what they're doing will be effected negatively by the people who don't care. When this happens people stop working together and when you're not working together as a team then everyone becomes disinterested and will not do their best work.

secondly, Students may not have a lot of time for extracurricular's. Some parents may not have time to pick up and drop off their children to these after school activities. Also, Students may participate in extracurricular's outside of school that may be effected by there school extracurricular. Students that would have to do both extracurricular's may not have time when they get home to do their school work and their home duties. This could put a lot of stress on students and they could be effected by this stress at school.

On the topic of students being stressed, Their performance in school could be negatively effected by extracurricular's. When students do not have time to do their homework at night they are forced to stay up late. Students sometimes go to sleep almost in the middle of the night and could get sleep deprived. The next day, students could be tired and falling asleep in class. When you fall asleep in class you are not paying attention to the material or doing your work and after a certain period of time of this happening your grades could start to drop.

Extracurricular's are fun activities for students when they're done with school. Extracurricular's will have a negative impact if they are forced onto students. Extracurricular's should not be forced for these three reasons, lack of interest, not having enough time, and after school activities could hurt students performance in school. To me extracurricular's are fun but they may effect some more than others.                                                                                                      ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
B94059412B2C,"What if your principal said that everyone would have to stay after school for and extra hour only to participate in a useless activity? How would you feel if someone where to interfere with your schedule? The school says that we must participate in an extracurricular activity. You might be wondering why the school would want us to participate in a club. The whole reason is because they think that it would shape our future, give us a learning experience, and make us want to learn something new. Although this is true, there are more downsides to this rule than you think. It is completely unfair to force students to partake in an activity.

One of the disadvantages in a required school activity is that people might not have enough time to do things they normally do. If we take an extra course, there might not be enough time to finish all our homework. When I get home, I have a substantial amount of homework to do, and I have to practice the sports I play. My schedule is already full. homework takes me the longest to do. I work on my homework thoroughly. I try to make sure there isn't any mistakes. When I do this, I'm more likely to pass the test because of how much thought and time I have put into my work. I describe this as my work ethic. My homework takes me about two to four hours at most and it takes up most of my schedule. The sports that I play take two hours. With a total of seven hours at most, I can never seem to fit anything else in my schedule. This might be surprising for other people but this is the daily schedule for average students and most students might have more to do. If we even tried to do an extra activity than we wouldn't be able to finish all of our work efficiently and properly. Adding another thing to do every day would throw off our work ethic and our grades would most likely go down. Time has such a drastic effect on us students because it can be hard to manage. Our parents, for example, suffer from time management along with us. If we all do an extra activity, then that means that school is extended another few minutes. This is hard for our parents who pick us up after school. They have to find another time to pick us up which can be stressful since their schedule is as cramp as ours. We are not able to participate in an extra curriculum because of the amount of time that we don't have, and even if we were able to, there might not be any other options.

Although time is no problem for some people, we students have to choose which activity we would like to do. Maybe you don't like any of the clubs or classes that are provided. Then they would have to choose a club that they do not enjoy, and would most likely not gain anything from their experience. Students will not gain any experience from the activities because it seems boring to them and they do not pay attention. I don't take any clubs because of the lack of time. There are some days however that I feel that I have no homework and I can do whatever I want to do. I try to join a club and there is nothing that interest me. I don't play any of the insanely popular sports, neither am I good at chess or other things. There is one club that I am interested in doing but they are only open on the days that I'm busy. I can join other clubs that my friends are in, but I will feel awkward because I don't know anything about certain topics. If the school makes it required to do an extra school activity, then some of us will not feel like going to our certain club. Because the clubs might be uninteresting for some students, they will not want to attend, and students will lose interest, and teachers will eventually get tired from teaching unfocused students.

Feeling tired after a long day of working is very common. We get tired because of all the stress and thinking we had to do all day. After a normal school day is over, kids are really tired and are exited to go home. We go to sleep late at night, and wake up relatively early, making it hard for us to get up, which makes us more tired than the average person. Making clubs required means that school will be extended. It is not reasonable to force the students to stay an additional few minutes to do more work. Even if the we are not tired from a school day, we still have loads of work to do after school. The same goes for the teachers. They don't want to teach kids for any longer. If the teachers have a bad day than it's even worse because they want to be alone. After their final teaching session is over, they have to do more work like grading test, projects, or homework. When school is over, I'm extremely exited to go home. I'm am sure that everyone else feels the same. If I had to stay in school for any longer, I wouldn't feel good when I come home. When I get home from the extra activity that I'm doing, I'll feel so drained and I won't be able to practice tennis, or focus on studying for a test. My English teacher, Generic_Name, says she is very tired from teaching all day. She thinks that there is no point in making kids more tired because they probably can't do their work correctly at home. With the tired students and teachers, there is no point in required extracurricular activities.

There is more to just being tired, time management, and interest. We are not going to gain anything from the classes and we will certainly not approve of it. Making after school clubs required creates more problems, Not just for the students and teachers, but for the whole school. Think about what you would gain from the extra school classes, and how easy it is to get that experience by a different, easier method. Our schedule is so cramped we can't add anything else. Some of us might not have like any classes that are provided. Almost all of us would be tired from all the new things we have to do. Think about how tired you would be, and how much time you really have, because extracurricular activities should not be required.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
3F0396A77EE0,"Personally, I've always enjoyed participating in clubs. Which is why I believe that if the principal were to decide that everyone had to be in a club, I wouldn't be opposed. I think that having students participate in extracurricular activities is good because they can improve teamwork and relationships, they are something colleges look for, and they can help relieve the stress of school.

First off, they can help with relationships and teamwork. Doing an extracurricular where you frequently work with others can help to improve social skills and teamwork strategies. This will definitely help you in your older years, especially if you're going into a field where you need to be able to communicate with people. Communication and collaboration are things I've gotten much better at since I started joining clubs. You can also meet and connect with new people. I've met some of my closest friends in clubs.

Secondly, they're something that colleges look for. Colleges tend to seek people with some experience, and clubs can help you gain that. Picking clubs that lean more towards the major you want in college can be helpful. Certain extracurricular activities are more desired than others, but any clubs will help your application look more desirable. The National (Junior) Honor Society is an example of a club that lots of people apply to because it looks nice on applications.

Lastly, clubs can help relieve the stress of school. School can be incredibly exhausting at times. That's why some people sign up for after-school activities. They can be an escape from day-to-day life. These activities let us do something we enjoy that we might not be able to do during school. On days when the clubs I am in meet, I look forward to it the entire day. I have had friends say similar things, such as ""I can't wait for rehearsal!"" or ""Track is something I'm really looking forward to this year!""

If one day the intercom were to turn on and our principal would say ""Every student is expected to join one of our extracurricular activities,"" I wouldn't be upset. I believe that this is a decent idea because clubs can improve relationships and teamwork, they are something colleges look for, and they can relieve the stress of school.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
D3CFD3E68F27,"A wise person once said,""Education is important but the human mind must not be too overwhelmed and stressed."" He or she basically stated that education is important but a working human still needs rest. Well my principal wants all students to participate in extracurricular activities. Most people disagree with the principal because students have to go through seven long hours of solving the quadratic formula, memorizing the United States court system, and writing down scientific formulas. They don't need to be obligated to do more activities out of school. I disagree with the principal forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities because students still have other activities out of school to do and they need some rest and downtime after seven long hours of learning.

Students still have other activities to do out of school. Kids can be participating in sports teams, karate, dancing, and many more. Adding extracurricular activities will interfere with these activities happening out of school. To add onto that having extracurricular activities to go on with the activities happening out of school can put too much stress on a young child's mind. For example, I play for two basketball teams out of school, if I were obligated to participate in extracurricular activities my schedule would be overlapped and crazy. I would be overwhelmed and I might even have to miss some practices because I would have to stay after school everyday.

Students need downtime and rest after a long seven hours of learning. Students have to go through the pain of doing algebra problems and memorizing scientific formulas for seven hours almost everyday. Usually when they get home they still have do homework that was assigned. Although students should work hard they still need some time to rest, relax, and just have some downtime. For example, I usually get assigned homework everyday. If I were forced to participate in extracurricular activities I'll be exhausted and I might not even turn in my homework in time.

In conclusion, I think the principal should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities because kids have other activities to do out of school and they still need time to relax. Making students participate in extracurricular activities would overwhelm them because when students arrive home they still have to do homework and the activities happening out of school such as sports teams and dance clubs would be overlapped.

99B999A8E782,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity to do after school do you agree?

Yes, I agree most people have time after school to join something, people try out for a sport but some of them dont make it,they have something to look forward to after school. People think school is boring but here is a way for it not to be.

Most people have time after school , some people when they get home just play video games or eat because they have nothing to do, sitting around because there bored. Playing video games isn't good its bad for your eyes and your brain by sitting in front of a screen all day, playing video games dosen't accomplish anything. Eating because your bored doesnt do anything either except make you fat because your not working out or doing anything it just turns into fat. Sitting around because you are bored than if your bored do something for the school because they need people for sport teams and other things.

People try out for sports but dont make it , so they quit, they dont want to do any thing, make your own sports club. So they quit because they didn't make it so they feel like well I can't do anything else. They don't want to do anything because there sad or they don't want to practice any more because they don't feel like they can make it. Make your own sports club by get a group that didn't make it in a sport and practice together then when tryouts are again your group can tryout together, if you tryout in a big group there more likely to pick you to be on there team.

People have something to look forward to after school , do better in school, grades are improving, there liking what they chooses. Do better in school, people will get there work done instead of messing around. Grades are improving, people won't want to get kicked out of there groups or clubs so they will work harder and take it seriously. People will like what they chooses, they picked what they like instead of the school picking for them they actually want to go to there club, sport, maybe there own club if they made one.

You get to be you and not feel like you can't you fail you try again. If you don't make something you make a group but better. I agree with the principal we should have to do a group or a sport because its really going to help people with friends, bordum, grades these are just the little things there are more and more to go on about.

197A2E0615B2,"Students are children, but when schools force them to stay in schools for an extra curricular activity, when are they allowed to be care-free children? Students are more likely to endure stress if time is taken away from them, especially with it is mandated by the school. Most students already feel pressured with the amount of homework that is needed, so when time is taken for Soccer Club, it isn't fair to them. The overwhelming feeling of having to stay after school without the students consent enforces the limited time they have to be a child. The need to have each student participate in one extracurricular activity will have a negative impact for various reasons such as the carelessness on money habits, increase of excessive behavior, and parental enforcement for schedules.

Moreover, the increase of money will revenue towards after school activities rather than going to the better needs for students. Teachers will be working overtime with no pay, and the money towards supplies for extra curricular activities will be spent in a reckless manner. Rather than spending money on new laptops for all students to use, the money will go towards sports activities. Also the teachers will be teaching an extra class with no say, especially if every student is to stay after school. Many teachers may miss time out on their basic needs for after school activities. For comparison, it is as if someone worked a whole day and never got paid, and missed out time to be with their family. Lastly, the money that goes into extracurricular activities will not go to the pockets of hard-working teachers.

Furthermore, the work of teachers will be obsolete because of the excessive behavior that will be endured when having every student participate in an extracurricular activity. For example, when I was participating in Coding Club, I was ecstatic to be in a new club where I could truly learn. Until a group of students started to mess around, they were playing games on the computers and throwing the computers. As a result, the Coding Club had to be shut down and I was devastated. Not only did they choose not to care about the club, it is that they were showing no remorse towards the teacher and other students. This is bound to happen again, especially when all students must attend a extracurricular activity. Students will choose not to care and it will create a domino affect of misery for both students and teachers.

Continuing, parents will be enforced to have a certain job schedule due to the enforced extra activities which may cause many to be upset with the new rule. The need to have one day of an extra curricular activity will not only be a burden to the students participating, but the parents as well. Parents may not be able to pick up their child at a certain time because of their work schedule. Buses may be put in use because of this, but then will also interfere with the schools budget. This will be in the fault of the school since the rule is mandatory, and this will also force the parent to be at a certain time to pick up their child. If the parent is not able to, this will cause the student to stay at school, waiting for their parent to pick them up. This causes the child to miss out on day-to-day needs, such as homework. Students and parents will have a burden for other activities and needs because of the need of participation in an activity once a week.

Subsequently, one extracurricular activity will have a negative impact due to the reckless spending of money, student's uncontrolled behavior, and interference with parents' job schedules. The money that will go towards extra activities will not go for the students needs. The untamed behavior of students will interfere with the teachers unpaid work when having every student participate in an extracurricular activity. Adding on, parents will have to change job schedules to pick up their child from school on time, which may interfere with the parents job. Education enforced every day on a daily basis on a student, so when they are enforced to stay after school with no say, it is unfair to the student and parent.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
EE2DBFDFBAFD,"I disagree, because it should not have to be something you must do after school. Students should have a choice on if they want to stay after school or not. Some students are usually busy after school and don't have time no matter what activity. A lot of students do sports and some even very seriously, which means they have practice a lot. After school they would not have time to stay because they need to get to practice in order to be successful at the sport they are playing.

Older students usually work. Meaning either on the weekends or after school, they might have to work to support their family or themselves, and to successfully do that they will need to work more and harder. Staying after school can cause lack of hours or cause their shift to go a few hours forward, which can lead to getting off their shift rather late and have trouble waking up or paying attention in school the next morning. For an example students usually work at super markets, fast food restaurants or even babysitting. They either babysit for money or their own siblings for when their parents don't get home after school. Students would have to get home immediately for the safety of their younger sibling and to make sure he is taken care of.

On the other hand staying after school would maybe help, but mostly for students who will not be busy after school. There are activities like sports, helping/working on yearbook, and serving on student counsel. Students who do these are usually free after school and have nothing to do, so to ease out their boredom these would be very fun. Then there are also students that won't have a parent home after school to take care of them causing them to stay for an after school activity without a choice. At last there are athletic kids who just want to stay after school for fun sports or even non-athletic ones who just want to learn how to play a sport.

I still stick with my opinion even if there are benefits to staying after school for some students, but most still gain nothing from it. In my opinion working and and going to practice after school will gain you more benefits especially for the future. Working can help prepare students for college. If they save enough money they would not have to get a huge student loan which would cause them to have debts in the future. Sports can also help a lot of students in the future. Working hard and attending every game and practice will get them better at the sport and can help them get a full ride scholarship to a college, so they wouldn't have to get a student loan or get money from their parents. Some may even have a chance at D1 which can possibly lead them to play professionally. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Students should have extracurricular activities.

Having extracurricular activities can benefit students in many different ways.

First, when students have extracurricular activities, it will make them want to try harder in school.

When students try harder in school, their grades may increase.

When their grades increase, they have a better chance of getting a job than what other students have.

Students could push themselves to success depending on what activity they have.

Second, when students get the chance to have more activities, they could be inspired about their future occupation.

Having extracurricular activities could inspire kids to get jobs and want them to become successful.

When students have this opportunity, it could help them see their future.

If a student does not have the activity that they were hoping for, there are still more activities for the student to chose from.

Lastly, when students get to participate in the yearbook, sports, and student council, it will make them want to do it again next year and the years later.

Students get to make new friends and it will make them want to come to school everyday.

When students come to school everyday, the schools grades and attendance as a whole could increase because students are willing to come to school because of their extracurricular activity.

It could also help students make more friends because maybe somebody does not have anyone to love them at home.

They have the students there to help them feel comfortable and welcomed at school and maybe they will come to school everyday.

In conclusion, students should have extracurricular activities to make them want to try harder in school, learn about more careers for the future, and help students make new friends.

These are my reasons students should have extracurricular activities.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
FD9CC83A98C5,"your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. for example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. do you agree or disagree with this decision? use specific details and examples to convince others support your position.

i agree because students who do not like to do sports or anything at all its good for them to do something to keep them busy and occupied. And someone should at least convince them to try something new in sports.

when i was younger my mom always told me that i should do basketball. Because i wasn't doing a after school sport at all and i didnt like sports at the time. So we talked about doing it and i tried it i kind of liked it it was fun because of the basketball drills and got to meet new friends on the team. after that i started doing flag football, and tackle football and i enjoyed it and i was always busy and occupied.

i think students who don't do any sports should try it. because it will keep you busy and you would enjoy it because you meet new friends and its very competitive. other than that it will keep you from being on your phone and staying home all day bored when you can be out having fun playing sports. And also sports would make you think about what you wanna do in the future if you really like sports and good at it. It would also make your family proud of you because of all the hard work you did to get this opportunity. But it also takes time to be good at something only if you try. because thats the only way to get somewhere.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
2A60500B8179,"Do you participate in a school activity? Weather or not you do, imagine that your principal made everyone in the school, including you, participate in at least one school activity. I think that would be a great idea because students could meet new people, be more active, and find a new talent or skill they didn't even know about.

Do you know someone who might not have a lot of friends or talk to a lot of people? Your principal making at least one school activity a requirement could help fix that. I think that students meeting new people is very important. Especially in today's age, when most of our communication is done online, and not face to face. If every student did at least one school activity, kids would meet a lot of new people.

Keeping kids healthy has been a issue for years as more kids are staying inside instead of going outside. Most school activities will provide kids with enough activeness needed to stay healthy. Even if the activity isn't outside, getting out of the house is still good.

A lot of students have un-discovered talents and skills. One of the best things a school can do is help kids discover un-noticed talents. Maybe there is someone in your school right now, who will one day be the best football player ever. As their one required school activity that kid picks football, he finds out he is really good at it, and ends up going to the NFL.

A lot of schools focus way too much on education and so little on student's personal lives. If all schools required one activity for students it would improve the quality of life for the student at home, and at school. Meeting new people. being more active, and finding a new passion or talent are all good reasons students should be required to do at least one school activity.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
9EE34B9761BF,"If you're principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity how would you feel? You might have the same opinion as me or you're opinion might be a little different then mine. Here are my thoughts about how all students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I would disagree because students may not have enough time, their parents might not be able or have time to pick them up, and they may not enjoy being around other people.

My first reason is students will not have enough time after school. They might have to go with their parents and pick their siblings up. The students may be involved with something outside of school like a youth group or they may volunteer somewhere. They could play travel ball or even their siblings might. When the students get home after school they most likely have a lot of homework to do and chores to finish.

The second reason is their would be no provided transportation. Their parents may not get off of work in time to pick their child up from school. Maybe even their boss told them they can't leave their job early. The students parent just simply may be working that that day or week. The only possible way the student can get home is by riding the bus, because there is no provided transportation for after school activity's.

My last reason is that some students don't like being around one another. They might not like socializing because they have anxiety. Kids may bully them and are rude to them. The student might be really shy and not have the confidence to talk to people and make new friends. The student's may not get along with each other because something happened between them.

Those three reasons are why I disagree. The student's should always have a choice on what they want to do. Even if you don't like any of the activity's that they provide. That choice that you choice choose should never be forced. You as a person should always have a say so, and you should never be forced to do anything that you don't want to do.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
43A4DCBC26BB,"Imagine if all students participated in an extracurricular activity. That's a crazy thought, but also a very intelligent one. A huge population of students do go to after school clubs and sports, but what about the ones who don't because they are to shy and don't have many friends. If the principal is making all students participate in after school activities it will be an excellent idea because, students will find new friends, the clubs will keep students active and off their phones, and they can learn new things and experience new activities.

First off, since all students have to participate in after school clubs then they can make new friends. If they see someone not talking to anyone then they can go over and introduce themselves. Students will also be able to hangout with friends they already have. This would be really awesome for kids who are shy. Having to do a club will get them out of their comfort zone and push them to make new friends. The next thing is, getting to go to these activities will keep students active and off their phones. Most adults would say students are like bears in hibernation. Once they go into their rooms they don't come out unless they need food. Now students won't be sitting inside they will be able to get out of the house. No phones will be allowed so students won't have their eyes glued to the screen for any longer than they should. This idea will also keep students thinking about other things than social media. They won't have time to worry about if their new post got more likes than their friends post. Lastly, they can learn and experience new things. In sports they can learn to cooperate with a team, and work on their sportsman ship. Having to do a club will also help students find new interests. They could do a Science club and realize how much they love it when they see something explode into a puff of air with a big popping sound, or when an experiment makes a massive sticky and disgusting mess. Having to do a club will also help students learn more about working. Instead of sitting at home having their parents do everything for them, they will learn how to do it themselves.

In conclusion, if the principal is making all students participate in an after school activity it's going be a grand idea because, students will make new friends, they will be active and away from their phones, and they will be able to learn and experience new activities. Not every student is going to agree with this because they would rather play on their phone or computer, but if the principal really enforces this idea then it will happen. A flaw in this plan is that students might not show up and never come to any of the meetings and activities. Yes this is something that could be an issue, but if the teachers in charge of the clubs gave out consequences for students who continued to skip every meeting without an excused absence, than this will work. Now that our principal is really making this happen, our school will become a better place.         ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
EB71F370D655,"Ever get bored after school, and just have nothing to do? Our principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Examples such as, participation in sports, working on the school year book, or serve on the student council. However, there is many pros and cons to this situation.

Meeting new people with the same interest is awesome, and could make strong bonds. 89% of students form better relationships when they have something in common with each other. Examples include, same taste in music, art skills, outdoor sports, movies, and video games. Students can work together, and make their passion a reality. All because students stayed after school.

Today's birthday is the mother of a student, but the child has to stay after school. Most students wake up around 6:00am to 7:00am for school, and leave school from 2:15pm to 3:00pm. Therefore if our principal makes students do an extracurricular activity it would last up to 5:00pm. Which makes school days 10 to 11 hours, and only about 5 hours of family time. So should that student stay after for math just to find the slope of a line or spend their rest of the night celebrating their mothers birthday?

Student stress levels are just getting higher, and higher each year. From 2016 to 2020 studies shown that the stress level in teens has increased to 78%. Students have 5 core classes, and 2 electives which is 7 classes in total. Students have lots of school work, and it could get overwhelming. Staying another 3 hours for an extracurricular activity could result in more stress, pressure, and just the feeling of getting consumed by millions of assignments. It could be fun doing what you love, but in the back of teens minds they have to study, practice, understand knowledge just to get a grade above a B.

So ever get bored after school, and just have nothing to? Join actives with people that have common interests. If you agree make sure your stable enough to do so. Because grades can go down, and relationships can start to fade.

Joining an extracurricular activity can benefit the student's lifestyle in many different ways.

All students must participate in at least one activity because it helps them find a new hobby and will benefit their health and academics.

First of all, participating in new activity will help students find a new hobby.

Students have a opportunity to discover something that they never knew they would have enjoyed.

For example, when they attend an club such as yearbook, cooking club, or soccer, they may end up liking that activity that could lead to a future career, such as being a writer, chef, athlete, etc.

Second of all, they will find themselves constantly busy.

Most teens are always complaining about how bored they are, but once you find a hobby, you will be motivated to practice it rather than lying around on their bed or going on their phones.

Students may discover a new hobby they enjoy when they join a club.

When they join an extracurricular activity, they are benefiting their health and academics.

For example, joining a sports team will improve their mental and physical health.

Playing a sport will not only help them get their daily exercise, but they'll be able to make new friends that will cheer them on along the way.

Second, academic related clubs improve their learning.

When they join academic related clubs such as poetry circle, book club, or math league, it can help improve their grades and increase their knowledge.

Students' health and academics can be improved when they join an extracurricular activity.

Joining a club will help students experience new things and be able to improve their lifestyle.

5A6AE4CDEEF1,"The school bus doors close with a hiss behind you as you walk down your driveway. You enter your house and sigh with boredom. Once again, the rest of your family is out participating in activities, and you are left alone at home with nothing to do. This situation has occurred to many people that don't participate in any extracurricular activities. I believe that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will be able to meet new people, find a new passion, and it gives them something to do.

If you are looking to meet new people, joining an extra curricular activity is a great way to do it. It is easier to make friends with people whom you share common interests with. So, it will be less difficult for you to talk to someone who has joined the same club as you because all of the people in that club at least share the common interest of the subject of the club. Participating in the same activity and being in the same room encourages you to talk to people. When I am at swim practice, I am encouraged to talk to the people in my lane because we are swimming together for one and a half hours, so why not get to know them? Because of this, I have made new friends outside of school, and I regularly spend time with my new friends outside of swim practice as well. Meeting new people is only one benefit of extracurricular activities, however, there are many more.

It is hard to discover hidden passions if you don't try new and different activities. Through these new activities, you could discover that you have a strong interest in robotics that you were not aware of before. If you find an activity that you are passionate about, your life will be much more exciting and enriching. It can also help you figure out what type of career you want to pursue when you grow up. Naturally, people will want to pursue careers that are related to subjects they are interested in. So, it will be much easier for you to decide because you have discovered your passions and talents at an earlier age. My father signed me up for theatre one year, and when he first told me, I was apprehensive. I am naturally a shy person, so I didn't think that I would enjoy being on stage in front of a large crowd of people. But, I ended up really enjoying the whole experience and participated in that theatre camp for three more years. Also, when I first started taking piano lessons, I thought that it would be a huge waste of time. But, I found that I was quite talented at playing the piano, and I enjoyed creating music that my family and friends would loved listening to. Extracurricular activities help you uncover new passions, and they also provide you with something to do.

Participating in an extracurricular activity is a productive way to use your time. Many students come home and waste time on the internet or social media because they have nothing better to do. There is nothing worse than coming home and finding out that your child spent four hours watching a cartoon on TV. An activity would give them something to think about or allows them to spend their time somewhere productive. When I have nothing to do at home, I play the piano because it is a great way for me to use excess time and I enjoy doing it. On the days that I am not at swim practice, I would feel like I have too much time on my hands. But, I have other extracurricular activities scheduled for those days. like meeting with my math team or piano lessons, which prevent me from experiencing painful boredom. These are only a few reasons why students should participate in extracurricular activities, and it can be seen that there are significant benefits.

In conclusion, students should participate in extracurricular activities because they give you something productive to do, they help you find new passions, and allow you to meet new people. Every student should choose one extracurricular activity to participate in because of the plentiful benefits these activities provide. Suddenly, you realize that today was the first day of track practice, and you frantically call you friend, asking them if they can come pick you up and bring you back to school. When they arrive, you hurriedly jump into their car and anxiously wait during the drive back to school. Once you are finally there, you burst out of the car and hurry down to the track. Luckily, the coach only just started with stretches, so you put down your bag and stretch with the rest of the team.

You are unbelievably excited to go home but then you remember the you have a sport after school and you are starting to get stressed and you are thinking when will I have time to do my homework, when will I have time to study for my test? I dont think it should be forced to have a extracurricular activity after school because some students are already committed to sports outside of school, it is not needed, and some students have jobs.

After school I am committed to gymnastics four days a week three hours every practice and if I had an extracurricular activity after school I would be tremendously stressed. I love gymnastics and if I were to quit because of school I would be thoroughly upset. School is very important and I want to do good in school but it will be hard to succeed in school if I have an extracurricular activity everyday. On nights I have gymnastics I dont get home until eight thirty to nine p. m. and it is already hard to get my work done but if I have an extracurricular it will only make it harder for me and my family.

Extracurricular activities after school are not needed. In life we would never need to know how to run a play in football or how to organize the yearbook. Yes it teaches how to be compatible and how to work together to get things done but we could easily learn that with having group projects in school. Most students will not grow up to be a famous football coach and the few that do could play football for the school. It should be a choice and not forced upon the students of the middle school and high school.

Most of the students in high school have jobs and it would not be fair to make them do an extracurricular after school and have them change their work schedule for that. I believe students should be able to do what ever they would wish after school and they shouldnt be forced to do football, cheer leading, or yearbook. The student should have a choice to do an extracurricular because I know some students are not involved in after school activities and they would wish to get involved but others are already committed to a sport of some kind or a job of some sorts. I can imagine balancing school, homework, studying, and a job must be hard but it would only make it harder if they had to do an extracurricular after school everyday.

Those are just few of the multiple reasons why extracurricular activities should not be forced upon the students of the middle and high school. It would be very stressful to try and balance all of that work out and still do good in school. It should very much be the students choice on whether or not they are going to do an extracurricular. It would multiply my stress if I had to do an extracurricular on top of the sport I already play.

They already have homework in Math, English, Civics, and Science and now you have to spend another hour or so doing a debate club you don't even want to be in. Does that seem fair? Students already have to spend over 7 hours at school they should be able to spend their free time in the way they want to spend it.

Although extracurricular activities are beneficial in many areas, it seems unfair to force every student to participate in them. The reason for this is a student spends 7 hours a day in school, and on top of that the average time spent on homework each day is from 30 minutes to 2 hours! That can add up to 9 hours of work that they are forced to do. Students deserve a little time to themselves so they can relax from all the stress they had to deal with during school. I think extracurricular activities might be beneficial for some people but they can be detrimental to others.

Students spend over 7 hours a day at school and 30 minutes to 2 hours doing homework. All students should be able to choose for themselves whether or not they want to participate in an extra curricular activity. Students need time to themselves to relax and have fun with their friends. They also need time to study for tests and complete homework.

I disagree with the principals' decision to force kids to partake in extracurricular activities. I believe that this idea would be a problem because it cuts deep into kids social time, it would negatively affect their attitudes as it is forced activity, and it could be a great loss of time for some of them.

I believe that forcing kids to partake in extracurricular activities would be a great mistake for it cuts on kids social time. The principal should recognize that kids usually socialize after school and placing all of them in extracurricular activities would limit their interactions. Kids need social time as it is one of the basic needs of humanity and life without it would be grey and dull. I remember when I was around seven years old when we went on a vacation to Japan. It was a wonderful place, but I remember that since I could not speak Japanese I rarely talked to anybody besides my family and the people that knew English. I remember coming back and getting new energy from talking to people as I had not been social for some time. Every time I look back, this moment always makes me remember that social interaction is a key component in the human life.

I disagree with this notion of forced extra activities, I believe that forcing kids to partake in extracurricular activities would end up in very disinterested and angry students. We all know that a person who wants to learn will do better in a activity than a person who was forced to. We will see that mixing interested kids who want to be there an uninterested ones will do more harm than good. I believe that kids should come to these extra activities voluntarily and not be forced to attend. I also believe that forced extracurricular activities would be bad to teachers as more clubs would have to me made and in result it forces teachers to work extra hours. This would cause disinterested and angry teachers which would further affect students and cause problems.

I believe that these forced extracurricular activities would be a waste of time for some of these students and cause them to miss other things that could have been on their schedule for that day. For example, they could have had a family/religious event that they would have to miss because of these extra activities. They could also be doing outside of school sports that they would have to skip because of these activities. In cases such as these extracurricular activities could be a major problem and could cause a very disheartened student.

In all I disagree with the principal that all students should be forced to commit to extracurricular activities for I believe that it would be bad for them socially, that it could affect their work ethic, and could cause major schedule problems. While I believe that these activities may help some students they do not help all and no one should be forced to commit to them.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
F880CDD90C95,"Have you ever felt the rush of winning first place or crossing the finish line? Have you ever been so determined you feel like your body will explode? Doing an extracurricular activity gives kids the privilege to have a hobby and feel good about themelves. I agree with the decision, and believe that all students should participate in an out-of-school activity because it makes kids happier, they meet new people, make new friends, and learn important skills along the way, that can be crucial for future situatons.

It has been scientifically proven, that doing an activity outside of school has made students happier than the kids that sit around or barry themselves in piles of schoolwork. There was a study at Oxford University a few years ago, back in 2016. They examined the affect of fifty college students attitudes and mood throughout one month, with twenty-five of them doing an activity unrelated to school, and the other twenty-five who didn't participate in an extracurricular activity. After a month of research and testing, the professors at the univerisity got their results. It was proven that the students that did do something unrelated to schoolwork, were much happier, had higher levels of dopamine, good grades, and were able to fuction through their daily lives with barely any obstacles or problems. However, the students that didn't participate in anything had lower levels of dopamine and were a lot more stressed out. Then, because of this, their grades were affected drastically. Doing an activity like track or joining a club would be better for a students mental health. An extracurricular doesn't just make kids happier, students can meet a lot of people and make new friends.

Doing an extracurricular activity will help people branch out, meet new people, and make new friends, possibly some important ones. Three years ago, I joined an organization called ""Girls on the Run."" They focused on running, races, and track. Then, at the end of the year, we would participate in a race called a 5K, which is a three mile run. At first, I was insanely nervous. My body would shake, and I would sweat dramatically. The other people that joined used to be a bunch of people I had never met or talked to before, but in the long run, I made great memories with them. All of us became very close, to the point where we were almost inseperable, and did everything together. All of us are still friends to this day, and hope to be for years to come. Doing an extracurricular gives kids a chance to branch out in their community, and make great friends along the way, that'll possibly stick beside them for a lifetime. Then, since an activity gives students a chance to branch out, they could learn very important life skills.

Participating in an extracurricular gives kids a chance to branch out, and also learn very important skills that'll help them in the future. My mom did Science Olympiad when she was younger, and was able to get to the national championship one year. Sadly, another team beat them, but my mom learned something very important that day. She learned that it was okay to loose, and how to accept that it will happen again in the future. Ever since then, when she lost something, she accepted it, and wasn't upset. My friend Generic_Name, from elementary school used to do track with me, but moved onto another sport. She was unbareably talented, and was as fast as a cheetah. When she won her first championship, she learned how to be humble, and learned not to think that she was better than anyone else on our team just because she won the championship. She didn't just do that though, she was able to encourage other people on the team to be humble as well, and not to brag if you did really good on something. In later situations, she knew not to brag or boast about the fact that she did better than someone else. Doing an activity helps people be better, and could help the students of the school be better as well.

Doing an activity outside of school would help the students be better people, and help them collect better personality traits. They'll become happier and less stressed out from other things going on, like problems with family or schoolwork, which will have a positive affect on their grades, family life, and social life. This, can lead to even more success in the future. Lastly, they can create lifelong friends, and meet more people which can help them get how used to introducing themselves to other people, and get used to the situation. This is another important skill for the future that is taught by an extracurricular. In conclusion, doing an extracurriular will make the students of our beloved school happier, make new friends, and learn important skills to become better people for the future.               ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0

For example, if your not certain who signed up for the same thing as you, you might meet new people who have the same things in common with you. You guys both could be really good at something and thats what you talk about. Another thing is if your on a sports team the players and you could go play whatever sport outside of school. Even in school, during practice it wouldnt be nerve racking because you guys all know each other.

Everyone has a talent, just others show theirs better than others. Well the extra activities could bring out the best in you and your abilities. If you play basketball, but you dont do it that serious why not try out for the school team? Who knows you might make the team and do really good the season and then the next season you can come back better than ever. Lets say your struggling in math and you really need the extra time to do good, But after some time of the help your one of the smartest people in the class and you help people who were in your shoes.

Not a lot of people like school. Believe it im with you im not a huge fan of school myself but i still manage to enjoy it a little bit. You see, if you and some of your friends joined the same club or did the same activity do you know how much fun that would be? All of you could talk and do something you guys might enjoy like sports, yearbook, and the student council. One more thing is what if you really wanted to play for the school basketball team but your grades are holding you back? Well everyone has to do an activity so you could play and enjoy it with your friends. That doesn't mean dont worry about your grades because that always comes first.

So would you be on board with this idea? It will get you new friends, help you find something inside you that you didnt even know was there, and it will make school much more enjoyable. I think every school should use this format for these 3 reasons i stated. Even though picking something you might not be good at or you dont know is a learning curve you could still have a blast with your friends.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
6200EAC0CBBF,"I agree with this decision. It is important for students to do these activities so they can learn more about the things they like to do. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because they can become more social and do better in school.

Students should participate in extracurricular activities because they can become more social. Participating in clubs or sports will help students make new friends. If you are on a sports team and you dont know anybody, then you should make friends with them to help improve your teamwork. joining clubs or sports will also encourage students to go out more. This can relate to making new friends. If students have friends, then they might want to go and hangout more, and maybe even make more new friends. Students may also want to try new things. If students are doing something they enjoy, they might want to find other activities or clubs similar to the first one.

Students should also participate in extracurricular activities because it will help them do better in school. Extracurricular activities will help improve grades. If you are on a sports team, there might be a certain grade or GPA you have to keep. If you dont have a high enough grade, then you will be encouraged to do better and get your grades up. They will also improve relationships with teachers. If you are in a club that is run by a teacher you already have, then you will want to show them that you are a good student, even outside of class. You might even be able to ask for extra help. Students will also have more help with their work. This also relates to making new friends. If you are doing an assignment and you need help, then the people in your sport or club might be able to help you. Some of them might even have classes with you.

Students should be required to take an extracurricular activity because it will improve there social and help them maintain grades. There are lots of clubs and sports to choose from, so students have lots of options. I am in a club and it has helped me make new friends.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
45699BBC8BB8,"i agree because student be sitting home doing nothing they should be participating in a least one extracurricular activity everyday.

because my mom said i need to do something instead on sitting in the house all day and i did because i play basketball because i was really good at it.

people may disagree because they be scared they mite not do to good and coaches mite yell at them.

And another is because your parents mite get scared because they think you going to get injured but it not that scary or not harmful for your child it really fun you can won prize and lot of other stuff to.

you can do other stuff to like the spelling bee you just got to study your word and jazz band you just play music you can play in the band you can cheer your team on when they play you can do chess club but you got to be really smart to be in the chess club and doseare not harmful for your child.

the most dangerous sports is football because you get hit really bad in the chest, your legs and sometimes your head and it dangerous another sport is soccer is almost the same as football injured and their other ones i cant explain.

So that why i agree on participate in activity because it fun and you can be famous one day and you can be a superstar it up to u so what you agree on .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
8ED6445B91AD,"Everybody likes to do fun things with their friend after school, so why not join an extracurricular activity!

For example, you could join a club that includes your interests, or start playing a new sport you've always wanted to try.

Participating in a least one extracurricular activity can be extremely beneficial in so many ways.

I believe that everybody in school should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can hang out with friends, stay active, and you can choose which activity you want to join from an endless number of options!

One reason I think it is a great idea for every student to join an extracurricular activity is because it is a great way to hang out with friends after school.

Spending time with friends outside of class is a great way to bond with each other.

For example, if you and your friend join a sports team, you will learn to trust one another and play well together.

Also, extracurricular activities are fantastic ways to meet new friends!

You will learn how to work with people who have similar interests as you.

Also, you can get a perspective on how they do things, which can help you to acquire a wide variety of skill.

Joining an extracurricular is a great way to spend time with people from other middle schools as well.

There is a possibility that you could go to the same high school as them, so becoming friends with them now could come in handy in the future!

Another benefit of extracurricular activities is that they can help you to stay health and active throughout the year.

Keeping your body healthy and fit will cause less health related issues, and will keep you feeling energized throughout the day.

Also, joining a sport in middle school will set you up for success in high school sports.

If you know that you want to play a sport in high school, starting to play it in middle school is an excellent way to get a head start.

Participating in extracurricular activities can also benefit your grades as well.

Exercise has been found to reduces stress, and with less stress you will do better on tests and be less tired throughout the school day.

Finally, the extracurricular activities to choose from are endless!

There are extracurricular activities for every type of person.

One of the many options is bound to fit your interests.

Also,

If you have your heart set on a specific club, you can start it yourself.

As long as your idea is appropriate, and others are interested as well, you can start any club you want!

For example, If you wanted to start a book club for a certain genre, all you would have to do is get signatures from others also interested and then talk to a teacher who works at the school to help sponsor it.

Also,

If there is a sport you want Generic_School to start offering, then just talk to an adult at the school about it.

I know many of the fabulous teachers at Generic_School play sports and would be happy to help you start a new one at the school.

In conclusion,

I believe that it is a great idea for every student to participate in an extracurricular activities because you can spend time with friends, stay active, and you can choose which activity you want to join from an endless number of options!

Everybody in the school can benefit from extracurricular activities in some way, even the teachers!

Everybody deserves free time to do what they want, and participating in extracurricular activities is the perfect way to do it! The ways extracurricular activities can help students, teacher and the community are endless!   ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A559A96650EC,"All students should participate in activities at school to keep themselves happy and to prepare themselves for their future lives.

First, students should participate in activities because they will learn to be more responsible. Students will learn to bring the material they need in order to participate in the activity they are in. Furthermore, responsibility will help them a lot in life and it would make their lives easier, because if people are not responsible they end up being losing their homes, lose their money, and then they would have to live in the streets and start begging for other people to help them. People should learn responsibility to prepare themselves for any trouble.

Second, Students will learn skills they have never learned before such as, Cooking, Painting, Drawing, etc. Some students when they grow up they would want to take the skills they learned from their childhood and earn money from them. Some students become famous artists or famous chef because they learned those skills from their school days.

Third, Students will learn to be mature faster. For example, some students are there because they want to take the job in the near future, so they will have to take in seriously and they will not have time to play around, they will be focused on learning the skills more then playing around all the time. Some people might agree with this, and some might not, some people think that a lot of kids are only there for the fun of the class and they dont take the class seriously, but kids are kids some times they will be playing around and some times they would be serious about the class. Some kids might want the job in the future and some are only there for the fun of the fun of the class.

Fourth, students will make even more friends when participating in an activity at school. For example, PROPER_NAME doesn't have any friends, so he decides to join a club or activity he likes and there he starts telling people what he loves and why he joined that club or activity and in a few days when he keeps talking to the other kids they become friends right away simple as that. Making friends in a club or an activity is that that hard all you have to do is tell people what you love and what you don't love and some people might have the same things that you love and they might become your friends right away.

Fifth, students will enjoy doing what they love to do. One reason why kids don't participate in activities is because the activities dont have things that the kids like. It is important to let kids do what they love unless it is a good thing, dont always stop your kids from doing what they love, this might affect their life, some kids dont get a job when they grow up and start living in the streets and selling illegal stuff, so it is important to let kids do what they want to do.

Finally, Kids should participate in activities they love in order to keep to help themselves in their future lives and keep themselves happy and keep themselves away from trouble and protect their future families.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
C73951E1672A,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some people agree, while others don't. Personally, I disagree with this statement. Maybe some students don't want to, they could have jobs after school, or are always busy.

Some students don't want to do extra curricular activities just because they don't want to do it. Maybe they have friends that have home-school and need someone to hang out with. Some students don't want to do extra curricular activities because they just want to go home. Those students do not want to do these activities and just go home. That is my personal reason why I disagree with the principal. People can get stressed out from things like school and just want to go home.

Few, but some students have after school jobs they do to earn money. Some students could be working so they could get a paycheck to maybe pay someone back, or to use it as their lunch money. I work with my Dad sometimes after school, and when I do, I get paid very well. Now if you earned money by, say playing Football, thats a completely different story.

Not a lot, but some people are always busy, and don't have time in their life to devote to an extra curricular activity or two. Things like chores are a problem when it comes down to this. Some people have 5 - 10 chores to do every day! Well, some people live on like a farm and have to do them every day with no excuses. Personally, this isn't a problem towards me, because I haven't gotten any chores for over a YEAR now!

Those were just a few things I could think of when t came down to the thought of this new rule. I bet people not wanting to, people having jobs, and people that are busy, are the top 3 reasons people couldn't do these extra curricular activities. The principal shouldn't force anyone to do something. In conclusion, students should NOT have to do any extra curricular activities.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
767A8DA91E69,"No one starts off knowing what to do in life, you can't be sure until you've tried many different things. That's why I think Each student should have to participate in extracurricular activities outside of their classes in school. Extracurricular activities are a great way to engage students brain's in subjects they're passionate about and is also a good way for students to find new hobbies. Without the students being exposed to many different activities they might never find their talent and what they want to pursue in life.

After school activities are a great way to keep the brain working even after the school day is over. Students can stay active whilst doing something they are passionate about like a sport or community service. For instance I do yearbook in school as one of my electives and sometimes I like to work on designs, quotes, and formatting at home. This is a great way to stay active by doing something that I like and something that benefits the school as well.

Putting students out of their comfort zones by encouraging them to try new things is also a great way for students to find activities that want to pursue. Maybe someone has played soccer ever since they were in second grade and they've never tried basketball, however when they get to middle school they finally try basketball and realize they love it. You can never be sure that you dont want to do something until you try it. For instance Lebron James didnt know he wanted to play basketball until he was introduced to it so you never know if your going to be the next star.

If every student did one or more extracurricular activity everyday the school could accomplish so many more projects. Students would be encouaged to pursue topics they're passionate about and would have the freedom of choice and they would also find new things they love doing and create new expiriences. All they need is a little encouagement.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
864E45D7BD5B,"Do you agree or disagree with the fact that our principle has decided that its a must to participate in extracurricular activities? I disagree because students should have a choice, some students do not have the time to participate in activities for certain reasons, and some students just don't like to be apart of extracurricular activities.

First, I disagree because students should have a choice if they want to be apart of after school activities. Students should not be forced to do be apart of any extracurricular activities. If they do not want to apart they do not have to because students can make decisions for their selves.

Next, I disagree because some students do not have the time to be apart of any after school activities. Some students do not have time to stay after school everyday. Some students have jobs. Some students might have things planned with friends and family. Students have more important things to do.

Finally, I disagree because some students just don't enjoy being apart of after school activities. Some students just want to go home, sleep, and watch TV. Some students hate after school activities because they have to stay back after school. Some students even hate the thought of having to stay back after school hours.

In conclusion, I think that all students should have a choice because some students cannot stay back after school for certain reasons, some students don't have the time to say back after school, and some students just don't want to stay back after school.       ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

Not everyone has the time or the want to stay after school. Students may want to have a break from school, but they will not be able to to do that. The principal should not make decisions for the students. He or she does not know what we do outside of school; extra activities may interfere with our outside lives. Students should be allowed the option to participate.

The students should get to help the principal make a decision. If the principal chooses for the students, then the students may not feel like their opinion is valid. they be unhappy and think that school is a chore rather than a fun learning environment. Students should have a voice in what they do so that school will be more enjoyable. when they get to make decisions, they will be more enthusiastic about their contribution.

extracurricular activities should be a choice. Not everyone likes the provided options. Some students may not want to take yearbook or student council. when their options are limited, students may think that they're being forced into doing something they dont want to do. if they had a choice, they would be more motivated to do the activities they want to. Students would not want to come to school if they are being force to do something that doesnt seem right for them. every student is an individual and if they're pushed to all do activities without a choice they will loose a lot of their uniqueness. choices are better than being forced

Students dont have enough time to do other activities. The principal does not know what we do outside of the classroom. students have to do a ton of homework and may also have to go to things like church or sports. if we are required to do extracurricular activities, then we will have to cut back on after school free time. school activities are for students with less homework and more free time. there will not be enough time for homework or leisurely activities. enough time is already spent in school. Students dont need to be there even longer. sometimes we just want to go home and relax, but if we are stuck doing extracurricular activities we can not do that. just like home and work are separate for adults, school and home should be separate for students. adults do not want to stay extra hours after work. they want to leave their office. Students feel the same way. time is not always available for extracurricular activities.

When students are not given a choice, they are miserable. we want to leave at the end of the day so we can do home work and relax. It is not a good idea to force us into doing extracurricular activities that Students do not want. school and home should be separated. We should have freedom about what we do after school. People may not have the time they need to participate in the school activities the want to. in those situations, they will be required to do an activity they dont want to do. the principal should not get make the decision for the students. it is unfair to people who have other after school activities to commit to.

132F7F82F555,"Imagine, You couldnt sleep all night. You can feel your eyes drooping in class. You hear the bell ring and jump out of your seat, but then you remember you have to go to year book club. Almost all students want to go home as quickly as possible. Once they hear the bell ring they are almost sprinting out of the classroom. One main cause of this is students not getting enough sleep. A lot of these activities don't catch the interest of many students. If you make students attend extracurricular activities, they might as well pull all-nighters everyday. Students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities because, they might not have enough time, some students feel safer at home, and finally some kids might not be comfortable.

Firstly, students might not have enough time. Homework is a big part of schools. Many classes give out large projects that take students hours to finish. By adding a mandatory extracurricular, it can shorten their time to do homework. This can cause them not to get enough sleep. Also, some students may participate in other activities outside of school. Such as, having a job or pre-payed activities. A lot of students baby sit, or dog sit to earn some of their own money. Hardly anybody will give up this opportunity of being able to earn their own money at this age. Finally, some students may have family commitments. Family traditions are common amongst the variety of diverse students. Many cannot miss these functions. Getting these students to participate is very hard, since they almost would never be able to make it. Even though some students may want to come, their parents wont let them attend because of these family traditions or commitments. Another example of a family commitment is having a responsibility at home. For example some kids might have to wash the dishes every Wednesday, or fold the laundry every Monday. If they have homework and chores to do, plus somewhere to go after school, it will add up. Students can become stressed. In conclusion, students might not have enough time.

Secondly, some students may feel safer at home. All teachers want students to feel like school is a safe environment, but it might not be as safe for some. Students could have experienced past trauma. For instance, they could have medical problems which caused them to pass out or have a bad reaction. There could also be a place at school where students dont feel as comfortable. All these scenarios could have traumatized them. They could have never seen the school the same way. Would you really want someone to stay somewhere that they dont feel comfortable in for a another hour then they are required? Also, a lot of students experience bullying. This causes them to dread going to school because they don't want to face that one person who makes them feel like nothing. If they stay in school another hour, they would hate school even more. This can cause them to lose interest in even more classes, even their favorite classes. Also many students have not made friends at school like many others. They might not fit in as well, or they just simply like being alone. Once they come home they instantly feel more comfortable in their surroundings. In conclusion, some students may feel safer at home.

Lastly, some pupils might not be comfortable in this environment. Many might not be comfortable working with other kids, which many of these activities require students to do. A lot of students also might not enjoy the activities offered. Most students feel very out of place in a class that they dont enjoy. For example, if a student is put into an art class, but they don't know how to draw, they are going to feel very left out from the artists in the class. Then, students will begin to drop out of the class. The same thing could happen with after-school clubs. If students never find the right club they wont want to come anymore, since they don't feel like they belong in any of them. Also, some students might be more comfortable at home. They can get along better with their parents than some people at school. This means that they enjoy going home a lot more than school. In conclusion, some kids may not be as comfortable.

All in all, It should not be mandatory for students to participate in extracurricular activities because, their time might be restricted, they might feel more comfortable at home, and finally they might not enjoy being there. Kids should be able to go home once school ends. They should't be forced to do anything by the school. If these activities are not mandatory, after a long day at school, you can come home and meet your comfy bed once again. ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
B150F36A25B2,"I agree, because he is giving the students many options on what they would like to participate in, such as running track or joining the highschool football team, or if sports do not interest the students then they can join student government and express their opinion on school matters and possibly even change the rule that the principal has put in to place. The examples that are given arent the only things that students can participate in, extracurricular activites can range from joining the student government to joining an after school world language club. If the principal had said every student in the school must join one sports team, that would be unfair to students who are interested in other subjects such as student body,art, or world languages, and if the principal had said that students have to particpate in one art program outside of school, the sport players might miss out on practice time.

Some might argue that its called extracurricular for a reason and that it should not be mandatory and students should decide if they would like to participate or not, but many young teenagers dont know how much they love something untill they try it, this rule would push kids that usually sit inside all day to try new things.

A common issue is that both of the students parents are busy with work or other things and that means the student might not be able to get a ride to and from the activities,many extracurricular activities can be done before school, after school, in the summer, or online. This wide range of times that students can adapt to makes it alot easier to participate.

Many high schoolers and middle schoolers make up friend groups based on what they are interested in, if a student loves art but is new to the school this is a way for them to make new friends and find out where they fit in and who they want to be around. Teachers can also use this time to form study programs to help the students that are falling behind in class or just need a small boost to help them understand the material better. In a program where the teachers and students are working together they can form a closer bond and this will make the student feel much better about coming to class. There are many reasons to join extracurricular activities and I think many students would feel the same way once they try it out, the rule the principal has put into place will only boost the students in the right direction. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
C67A906CFBA9,"At first, joining boy scouts seemed as though it was a waste of time. Camping, and doing community service wasn't something I was interested in taking the time to do. Little did I know, that through boy scouts I met some of my closest friends, and created some of my most cherished memories. For this reason, I believe students should be required to take a extracurricular curricular activities, because they come with many obvious benefits that have effect on the students and school community as a whole.

Requiring students to take extracurricular activities can get them to try something new they've never done before. This comes with many benefits, first, students will get to learn a new skills they've never touched on before. For example, if a student was in boy scouts and they learned about wood whittling, they may become very interested in that certain skill and take classes in school related to the skill, such as 3D art. As a result, that particular student may want to pursue 3D art as their future career. Second, the students will learn to become open to trying out new things. When someone discovers something new that they really like, they will try to expand that scope of interest, and try to learn new things surrounding that original interest. Thus, creating a healthy way for the students to challenge themselves through their interests.

Extracurricular activities are a great way to get people, to get together. Seeing other students at school is a good way to meet new people as well, but not everyone has the same interests, and that's where extracurricular activities ""one-up"" regular school time. When your in a group of people of similar interests it becomes easier to connect to people in the group, and extracurricular activities provide just that. Thus, creating stronger bonds between the students which benefits the students in many other areas of life. First, you'll have more people you can rely on and trust. Having someone you can trust is important, for example, if you were feeling down about something, you'd have someone who has your back and that you can talk to. Second, you'll feel much better about yourself. Being part of a strong friendship makes you feel included, more confident, and less insecure in yourself.

Lastly, being apart of an extracurricular activity can help benefit the community. Groups just like boy scouts always have events focused on improving the community planned. Through these events, students learn how to raise awareness and start community projects through first-hand experience. Boy scouts, however, is not the only extracurricular group that benefits communities. Groups such as the student council help shape the school policy to work with both students and teachers. They also raise awareness through events such as empty bowl night, which is an event where you buy a student made bowl to raise money for people in poverty.

In conclusion, students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. Making it a requirement can get students to learn new things, meet new people, and help the community. By supporting these smaller local extracurricular groups, or making it a requirement to be apart of one such as boy scouts. The youth of our community can reach their potential, and learn the necessary life skills needed to pursue a healthy future.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
8EA41EF1EC70,"I disagree with this statement because I feel like kids are tried after school and they want to go home and take a nap. A lot of people are busy and don't have time to do anything else because they are busy with there lives. It's hard to do anything else when you have a lot of homework and you have to get ready for school the next day.

When you get into middle school and high school you have a lot of homework more then you had in elementary school. You just don't really have time to do any thing because you are always busy with homework. I also think that if kids worked a little hard they wouldn't have much homework then they could do something. We would try are best in school.

The other reason I disagree with this statement is that kids should be active but a lot of people's parents don't have the money or time to drive them everywhere. Most parents just don't get off of work in time to drop there kids off. I would want my kid to do something active but I wouldn't have the time to drive everywhere.

I think that most kids get there energy out in the day in school running around in gym and running around outside. I think that most kids want to go home and go to bed. I think they would just be tired to play any sports or do anything. This is why I disagree with this statement. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
EBEEC72062D9,"Many students have time on their hands but most don't. I think that participating in extracurricular activities should be optional and not forced. Some students may need it but most are busy or already occupied. I think that if you are a student you shouldn't have to be forced to do extracurricular activities you should want to yourself, example if I wanted to do sports I should but if my dad or mom is forcing me then I dont want to. Extracurricular activities are optional for a reason they wouldn't be a part of our schools if we didn't choose for them to be. The reason I disagree with the principals idea is because most students don't have time, also a lot of students are usually helping their parents or doing schoolwork, or they just dont have reason to participate or don't want to participate in them.

I think that students should do extracurricular on their own time and not because someone is making them do it when there in the middle of something like a family death or a very important meeting with the boy scouts or maybe even another extracurricular activity that isn't a part of their school system. I think that if student have time they should consider it but they don't have to do it if they're not encouraged or they don't have the time to do it if they're busy I don't want them to have to do something that interrupts them. another reason is what if they're out doing something every night like supporting their family to help pay the bills, or out doing groceries because their parents can't, or maybe picking little Johnny from the bus stop. You can't just go do something because someone tells you to you should do it because u can or want to.

Another thing is most students go to school what would happen if I went to play soccer instead of doing home work or classwork that needs to be finished .many people in the United States are hard working even children do u think we can do extracurricular activities. If we need to do chores or work we can't do extracurricular activities if were doing school work. what would happened if we missed studying for the SOL because I was drafted to do soccer and I failed it, we would fail a grade because doing a mandatory extracurricular activity and to me that seems stupid.

What if we don't want to do extracurricular activities because they're not fun or interesting, what is the point of doing extracurricular activities if we don't like them. Also we could be going outside and exploring but if extra curricular activities are mandatory we couldn't have the fun we have every day we would lose interest in our lives. If we wanted to do activities then we could but they're called extra curricular for a reason not curricular activities we already have enough of those in school so why should we do them out of school.

In my opinion I don't want to be forced to do something that i don't want to do you can but I wont stand for it if I don't have to so please don't make me. We may not have the time to do it or may have something to do maybe we even don't want to do it because we have something better to do its just not right to make someone do something if they don't need to or more importantly don't want to. Also why force us to do them if you have six hour to do them in school, make us do it on your time not ours.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I purpose that all students most take at least one extracurricular class because students will enjoy it. For example, in my other school we used to pick our extracurricular classes. In class we used to make fun activities. The teacher used to show people our hard work. The principal sometimes gave prices to all the students that work hard in those classes.

I purpose that all students most take at least one extracurricular class because students can learn new staff. Usually students pic staff they would like to do/learn. In the extracurricular classes you do a lot of activities that make you learn new things in a fun way. For example, when I was in a extracurricular class i learn how to play soccer. I also learn how to make a yearbook online.

I purpose that all students most take at least one extracurricular class because students can make new friends. Usually in those classes you meet people with the same things/hobbies that you like. For example, in my other school in my extracurricular classes i meet one of my closes friend. We start talking because we both love that class.

859DCEBAAEC4,"Imagine your child growing up almost a adult and dont know what they want to be when they grow up. Thats why they shoudve taken extracurricular classes. You want to make sure your childs is succesful in life? then listen to this. The reason why I think it is good for students to take extracurricular activitys is because it is good to try new things, it will biuld up a work habit, and your kid might find something they would want to pursue in life.

A reason why students should do extra activitys is because it is good to try new things. Trying new things and exposing yourself to new things are good. It is good because say you get a flat tire and you have a spair one. Say you learned how to fix a tire in one of your classes you would know how to put it on and its good if there is no mechanioc around. You might use one of the skills you learned in thise classes. Its thanksgivings and your family wants you to cook the turkey but theres no prblem beccuse you took a cooking classs you already know how cook. You taking those classes could really help you for a job. You want to be a chef so you go apply and on your resume they ask what you know about cooking you can sasy you took alot of classes on it and you probably went to colonery school. Thats one of the reason why students should take extra activity.

Another reason why is because it will teach you a good working habit. You will get better at turning in your work on time. Lets say you have a project due it will be easier because you took job like classes and practice finishing your assignments on time. It will help you stay focuse on one thing. You will have a mind set that helps you not get distracted and stay on task. You will learn like you are at a job. You will get used to working longer and faster and working as hard as you can to get the task done. You see how this can really help you in and out of school becasue you will be better at using your time wisely.

It could help you find something you want to persue in life. You can biuld your life with these classes. You might something you like and that you might want to major in all because you tried it. Most people probably think differently about trying new classes because they dont want to force there in to doing sometghing they dont wanna do. BUt if they do only stuff they like say they major in it and the career doesnt work out what do they have to bounce back on? You wanna always have something to bounce back on but it wont be easy thats why you want to try new things all people in the world dont automatically know what they want to be when they grow up they have to try stuff learn things and they always have a backup plan. This is one of the vbest ways to find your career and will help in college.

As you see new classes will help with alot of things such as trying new things, biuld a work habit, and finding your career but toy want to make sure you really try new classes because its good in life. I explained all the possible things that can help your kids if they take extracurriculum activitys. Like help you in colllege. and in working and with jobs you will all ready be exposed on how to be a great worker. And you can know how to solve so many problems on your own by learning abt different things adn it will be cheaper. Thats why being in different activitys that you have never done before is good.        ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Well unfortunately that is what is happening to the students of this school today. Through my eyes students should not be forced and required to do at least one extracurricular activity. In this paper I will explain my reasoning behind my argument and why it is unjust to make students do extracurricular activities.

To start the argument my first claim is that the principle does not decide whether a student is to do an extracurricular activity.

In my perspective extracurricular activities are decided in the best interest of the student and is decided within the family. Not to mention the sports require a tryout. So if you don't make a sports team then the student may have to do something that does not appeal to their interests. I do not see the problem that is trying too be solved by making all the students do extracurricular activities.

There are many reasons why kids and students should not be forced to do extracurricular activities but to keep it short and sweet I chose my top two.

My second reason is that the interests of students are not all the same. Some students interest range from the sports and all the things that are provided at school to stuff such as fitness courses, the martial arts, and much more than just the regular things at school. Plus if they already started doing something outside of school then the extracurricular activities for them get very mixed up and quite frankly messes with their schedules.

This one does not take to much thought but would you rather be doing something you love or something you were forced to do. Me from personal experience would much rather do something I love because whenever I am forced to do something I am least likely to do it or be very upset and . When I speak for kids around my age I think we all can agree on that.

I realize that some people may say a good side to this topic is that it looks good on a resume or application and that it allows the kids to be more social. For the first part of the statement that was made, yes it would look nice on a resume for your kids but the thing is it is not your resume, it is theirs.

I do not think if what is on their resume they did not like or were forced to do they are not going to enthusiastically talk about the accomplishment. In my opinion you are correct about being social. But kids can be social in many other ways throughout the day. Some examples are already in the school day and in this day and age kids have so much more ways to be social.

Now that I have stated some evidence out of many I hope you see that us kids need to make choices for our self to practice for the real world. We need to decide what we are interested in and not what the principle is interested in for us. Our interests are usually what we pursue in life because we enjoy them. If we are doing something we don't enjoy then we are least likely to enjoy doing something related to whatever we did not enjoy because it was against our will.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A710C1BBBB27,"No, Participation should be earned in classes and treated that way student may not like the activities to offer and may would slowly effect there grade leaving many student to become upset with there grades. Ways students could earn participation is for in class work or volunteering around the school . Not every one would like to do the year book, Student council, and sports there instead might go to other things the school has to offer. Many student will lose intresed in the activities there doing and will quickly start disliking it leading them to not wanting to do it anymore.

Students grades may suffer if they dont do a sport and or participating in the year book some student may have other interests other than sports or student council. In the school tear grades will become a struggle for many students not getting participation in classes and some student may possibly have the chance of failing. Ways student could earn participation is with class work around the school and helping with fundraisers and other events. Participation would have a big effect on students leaving them to fail if not doing so thus grading participation should be changed a little so many students grade may not have to suffer just for them not doing a year book and other activities.

Volunteering for the school should earn a student some participation and to go to school events would earn them more depending on how big of an event. Student the provide there time into going to a school event would earn participation point every time that person goes and to make it more interesting the student will be rewarded with something at a certain amount of participation. The more a student spends time at events the more participation point with go to there grade. If a student dose not go to a school event instead of putting them as a failing grade they will just nit get any of the extra points they would not earn for not going to the school event so the student wont fail the grade. Not going to the event wont affect the students grades.

Some of not many student wont be interested in the events they have to do for participation due to that a students grade may suffer instead of having to do the event there not interested in that student will have an option to do extra things around the school. Like wise the student may not like the task so instead of the student getting a bad grade for not doing it that person just will not earn the participation points needed to earn and pass the grade. Different activities will earn the student a different amount of points the student will have more than just a few options and can choose from small extra thing to do around the school to earn small participation point or do a big help around the school to get a lot of participation points around the school. Having a student not interested in some yet not many of the things to do will just leave them with a little less of participation around the school and may lead to not passing a grade.

In conclusion, student have a choice pass the grade with a lot of participation points and going up a grade or failing and having to be held back for another year. Many student struggle with participation so ti think it being a big part of your grade would be very much foolish. Some of the student today dont do much participation but do a lot of class work with some times leads them to summer school and doing work but just not participating there. Some students may be shy and not want to participate in class but may want to do a one on one time with the teacher to earn those points they missed leading to them getting up to the points they need but just nit enough to pass. So student participation should be and option more or less than just a grade in its self and having many student suffer for not doing it and having them held back for some time just to go through it again and to do the extra work but no t get a grade for participation in class.                       ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
32700E9C48B8,"I agree with that all students must endure in a extracurricular activity because the activity is keeping you active, spend more time out or your home, and limit the amount of time doing unessecary things such as video games.

Extracurricular activities will keep a student active and happy while participating in the activity a student choose. For example if you do an afterschool sport that you enjoy, it is keeping your academics high which will better you for your future. Sports can get you where you want to be in life, you know if you are good at it and you put your mind at its best to what you are doing. For example if a student wants to be a lawyer then that students can do the extracurricular activity, student council.

Another reason why students must endure in a extracurricular activity because it is limiting the amount of time a student spends on their phone and video games. When you participate in extracurricular activities it is expanding your social life, because you are doing an activity or activities with other people which is a great way to make new friends. Making new friends during an after school activity carries on to the next day or so in actual school, so thats a good reason why students must participate in a extracurricular activity to expand the students social life.

Once you are in a extracurricular activity you are spending less time in your home doing nothing which is a good thing in this scenario. And video games fry your brain unlike an afterschool activiy. Any extracurricular activity is better than you being on your and video games because afterschool activities is basically keeping your brain active and healthy. Students should recommend exctracurriclar activities due to several reasons.

In conclusion to, extracurricular activities should be highly recommended by students because of several reasons such as keeping your academic skills up to part, staying active, and limit the amount of time a student spends on their cellular device and video games.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
2AB31C89B344,"I think students should have the right to chose what they want to do when it comes to after school. Extracurricular is not something students should be forced to do when it has no benefit for them in the future.

for example, some students might not find anything they like. Theres always gonna be limited options when it comes to after school activities,if students pick something they dont like that should be an option for them, theres a high change they wont have fun in what their doing. The main point for extracurricular is to have fun. Also if the students activity is dangerous or goes against school codes then it cant be done at school since most teachers arent qualified to do such things, its not like the school is going to hire extra workers, that causes the schools to lose money due to new teachers for different activates that are supposed to be optional. Students will also lose interest in the activity if they were forced to pick something that was supposed to be fun, this could lead to bad behavior from this student.

Students have different interests,they shouldn't force students to do something that should be optional. they shouldn't turn this into something serious it's better to just keep them for fun.

some students could be busy,a lot of students take different activities already for after school. Most students could be passionate about what their doing already. They dont need the stress or worry about a different class that serves no important purpose. Some kids need extra classes on what will get them into their favorite college or what ever they want to be be in life. Good grades are important for the classes they do need.

Being bust takes a lot of a students time,a lot of students are already busy with something else. Theres no reason to add to the work they already have.

Its also good for students to take brakes too,mental health is very important to every person especially students,so most of the time they need that extra time to be by themselves. Every student or person should be able to have time to relax and take a brake before going back the next day. Students can also enjoy doing activities alone instead of with different people they dont know,that can sometimes lead other kids to lose interest in what they used to like doing. That something could have been what they used to do in order to relax.

Breaks are needed for everyone, theres no reason students should feel pressure from something they should like doing.

in general its a bad idea to force kids to do something that should be optional,extra activities are supposed to be fun. its not something students should be stressed or worry about doing.    ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
9AEEADD5997A,"Did you know that 94% of students that participate in extracurricular activities do better later on in life than students that do not do extracurricular activities? All students at Generic_School should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities can be beneficial to students health. Another reason is that students would socialize with other people through the activities. One more reason is that new skills and techniques can be learned. This shows that it is important for students to participate in extracurricular activities.

The participation in extracurricular activities can improve and keep students health in good condition. Sports help improve the health of the students that participate in them because the students in them usually have to attend practices and games, which will most likely involve physical activity. Also, extracurricular activities can improve the mental health of students because the person participating will probably have fun, which makes them happier. One more reason is that the activities might make the people participating in them feel better about themselves, which can make their health and well being improve. If you want to improve your health, then you should think about joining a team, club, or other group.

Students that join teams or groups are more likely to be more social than people who aren't apart of a team or group. Joining a extracurricular activity can help the student make new friends that have the same interests as the student. Also, teams and groups usually require socialization, so everyone gets to know each other. Good socialization skills can help students in the future and when they go out in public because it will make them less awkward around people and more pleasant to talk to. Extracurricular activities can also help the students participating gain popularity and be more likable because they become known by more people and can be liked for what they are good at. This is why the socialization within extracurricular activities is a beneficial thing to a lot of students.

One last reason why extracurricular activities are a great thing for students to participate in is that new things can be learned through the activity. Useful skills can be acquired through the things taught by the people running the activity. The skills learned through the activity could be useful throughout that person's life. Also, lessons can be learned through the interactions with others and the actions that the student did. One last thing is that techniques on how to do things better can be learned. The things learned through extracurricular activities can be helpful throughout a person's life and can impact the way they do things in a positive way.

All students at Generic_School should join at least one extracurricular activity. Activities outside of school can improve the student's physical and mental health. Also, the socialization skills of a student can be improved because of the sports or clubs they're apart of. One final reason is that new things can be learned through the activities the student is involved in. This is why it is important for students to be apart of at least one or more extracurricular activities.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
0A273CDFC416,"Several people in the United States do not participate in extracurricular activities. Most of them sit at home, play video games, and don't do much in the community. They basically only come in contact with other people at school. But what if these activities where required? Required extracurricular activities would allow them to be communicating with other people all the time, not just at school. I think required extracurricular activities are a fabulous idea because they build friendships, keep students active, and progress social skills.

First of all, after school programs let you see your friends and possibly make new ones. This will help strengthen the relationship between you and your friends. Also, when participating in extracurricular activities, you meet all sorts of new people. I know when I played basketball, I met several new people from other schools, and I know a lot of the players from other schools now. It got me in public more often, and that's better for you than staying home watching screens all day.

Secondly, I think that extracurricular activities are good for keeping people active. For example, if you chose basketball as you after school activity, you would be running in practice, going up and down the court during games, and that would lead you to getting in better shape. They would also stay active in the community, because several of the activities involve people in the community. Things such as sporting events would involve crowds of people coming to watch and support their teams. In addition, being active and playing sport would help lower obesity, which is starting to be a problem in some schools. The running and jumping, and just getting up and doing things after school help you lose weight.

Thirdly, these activities would build social skills, as being out in public surrounded by other people force you to talk, and slowly build social skills. Social skills are used for everything in life, from making friends to getting a job. They are extremely useful for doing anything in life. Going back to making friends, these skills will make it a million times easier to do so, because communication would come naturally, and you would seem more friendly. And since most of these activities involve being in the community more often and meeting new people, it doesn't hurt to have this particular set of skills..

Lastly, I believe that I have proven that required extracurricular activities are useful, productive, and better for you than laying in bed or watching television. They develop friendships, keep you active, and produce social skills. Making friends in life is important, and after school programs help you make some lifelong accomplices. The social skills you learn might help you get a future job, and will most definitely help you with life in general. I hope many people view required activities differently, and will see the reason behind them.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
EB39727D0F7B,"This is the age that students should start to find new hobbies, passions, and goals they wish to have for the future as well as have available careers and colleges. I agree that students should participate in after school activities, here's why.

This idea could bring students to discover new hobbies and interests they might really enjoy. Evidently, this can help students to make new friends that share similar interests. This activity they might participate in could keep them active physically or mentally depending on what activity they wish to join. Every student is different with different interests, so they might not all like the options available. Students should look forward to what they enjoy doing in there child hood and carry those hobbies into there adult lives.

This is a great time for students to understand and follow there passions into the future where they can find career options and scholarships. These activities help students become more open minded about there future and over all make them better than ever in school and outside of school as well. Finding the right passion for each student is important so they know what they will strive for and where they believe there path leads into finding the best future they can have for themselves. Finding the right passion for the students is very important depending on which club they want and what the students want to learn in school as well.

Finally, all these ideas could help plant the goals they wish to achieve into their minds so they can work harder to achieve them and become more responsible with time, money, education, and work. Students have a wide variety of career paths and options to chose from, this is giving them a step in the right direction so they can see what they enjoy doing. More and more students will begin to work harder as they progress through school and enjoy what they like doing so they can strive for those goals they set for themselves. It also builds responsibility so they can learn to balance school and activity with a positive mindset.

Further more, students have many interest and will want a wide variety of clubs and activities to chose from. Although, some students may not want to participate in one of the activities available, make a suggestion to create an activity the student would enjoy so they can have fun and work for goals they set for the future.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

So now you have to stay after school and cant go home until another two hours! I disagree with this decision to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because kids have chores, homework, some kids dont even like sports, and we might have other plans.

The first reason I disagree with this decision is because some students dont like sports. Students should'nt be forced to do something they dont want to do. Some kids arent good at sports or they just dont like sports, but either way they shouul'nt be forced to play them, its not fair. Also, if students are staying after school to do an extracurricular actvity they wont have any time to do homework or chores. For example if I stay after school for two extra hours, that means im getting home at five o'clock. By five o'clock, I wont have any time to vacuum, do dishes, or homework before its time for dinner.

Lastly, as a student who plays two sports I have a buisy schedule with my practices and If im forced to stay after school for an extracurricular activity it will interfere with my practices. Its not only sports thats this can interfere with, but it could also intefere with plans you have with your family. For example if you want to have dinner with your family at six o'clock you wont be able to because you'll be to buisy working on the yearbook at your school or serving on the student council.

D8406ADB1493,"Some principals have decided that all students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity whether it be sports, yearbook club, or serve on student council. Extracurricular activities can be fun for students that have free time after school and sometimes before school to participate in the schools events. Extracurricular activities like sports can keep students in shape and even improve students social life. Clubs and student council can also improve students social life. However, students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because not only is school enough by itself, but students also need time for homework, family time, and time to get rest.

When students participate in extracurricular activities, they need to find a way to balance time between that and homework. Some students are not able to do that which is why they should not participate in extracurricular activities. Homework is important because it helps understand what is taught in class. If students rush through the homework as the teacher is collecting it in class, the students will not benefit from it. Not doing your homework will not only effect what you are learning in the class but it will also effect your grade if it is not done.

Also, when students participate in extracurricular activities, there are many reasons why it is important for them to have time with their families too. First, not having time with their families will effect them mentally and emotionally, because this may cause students to feel lonely. Next, not having family time may also upset their parents because the student may have a younger sibling or cousin that needs to be babysat. Last but not least, students may have a loved one that is in the hospital and if a student has to participate in an activity, they may regret not spending time with that person. Students may end up too tired to socialize with their families or go visit a loved one in the hospital when they are done with sports practice or a club meeting.

When participating in extracurricular activities, it may be hard to find time to get a good nights rest between finding time for homework, family, and school. It is important for students to have time to get a long rest every night because they need it to stay focused in class, sleep is required to have a positive attitude, and students need a good amount of rest each night to be healthy overall. If students do not have enough sleep every night, they may fall asleep in class and their grade will drop. Also, if students do not have enough rest, their mental, emotional, and physical health will suffer and they may not be able to participate in their extracurricular activity to the best of their ability. If the student is not able to do their best in the club or sport, there is no purpose in having them included in it.

Children should have a choice in school when it comes to participating in extracurricular activities because they need time to complete school work, they need bonding time with their loved ones, and they need time to sleep. It is important for principals to take all of these reasons into consideration before they decide to make all of their students participate in an extracurricular activity. If the student does not want to do the activity then they will not work to their best ability to be successful in it anyways. No student should be forced into doing something that they do not want to do when it comes to outside of school work and learning. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

I used to do basketball when i was smaller ,and when i was doing that i met one of the funniest people i've ever met ,and now she became my bestfriend. if you would like your life to be amazing when you grow up you should try a extracurricular activity and get a scholarship.

when you go to your activity you'll meet lots of new people ,and slowly you'll start to trust them and them too ,and then boom! your friends , when you try a dress on for example they'll say wow! that looks beautiful on you and then you'll have a much better self-esteem/ more confidence, also when you go to the mall and your looking for jeans for example and you say what about this one? one will say yeah it'll look great on you while others might say it looks fine but this one will look better on you and you'll have different peoples opinions if you try new things you'll probably find something that you'll actually like, like soccer my dad used to teach me how to play soccer but i didn't end up liking it but my cousin did he even ended up traveling the world because of soccer everyone is different i'm not saying that if you try soccer you'll like it but what i'm saying is you should try new things who knows you might end up traveling the world. you might even turn out to be outgoing you'll try something like skydiving something that i've been wanting to do for years or you might even like to do checkers something which i find pretty interesting but who knows only you will know when you try new things.

if you were doing football and you were really good you would most likely get a scholarship to a really good school and play for their team and if you put that on your resume ,and that job is like athletic or anything in general then your most likely gonna get the job, scholarships are good for your resume but their also good because your perants would be so proud that you got that scholarship all your friends and teachers would show some respect too.

in overall i agree, i think that students should do extracurricular activity cause it can actually help them allot like if you stay for afterschool you can learn more, and if you do a sport and you try your best im sure you can achieve anything in life. if you would like your life to be amazing when you grow up you should try a extracurricular activity and get a scholarship.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

It takes time for someone to find what they like to do,but because of all the choices students can try different sports until they find one that they enjoy best. One thing that I like about sports best is that they have endless opportunities for you to enjoy yourself.

If Sports isn't your thing you can try Student Council it also has many things to offer. In Student Council you have the chance in meeting new people all the time. The council requires you to work and talk to many people to help better the school and other students daily lives. As you grow older you'll acquire many life skills all student council will do is improve those skills to better prepare you for the next chapter in your life. Think of student council as an office they both have similar ways of running and getting work down the only difference is that they're on different scales. The thing about student council is that they do many things but a big role they play is helping others. The council does many projects to help students and the community like donating,holding fundraisers,and community service. Student Council plays a big role in school,students,and the community if you're the type of person that enjoys helping others Student council is just for you!

On the other hand many people say that an extracurricular activity takes your time away or is a waste of time. The reason for this is that many activities are held after school instead of school hours. However this is not true,nor correct,because extracurricular activities were not designed to take and waste students time. Students will be able to still be able to enjoy and relax during their free time. This is because the activities only take away a small portion of a students daily life plus there are some activities that are held during school hours like yearbook allowing students to take it as a class.

Every school has a wide range of clubs or activities,so that all the students can choose one to their liking that way they can enjoy it other then having to take something they have no interest in doing. Taking a extracurricular activities has many good outcomes and benefits from helping students improve their skills to allowing them to enjoy themselves and have fun. Taking part in a club affects everybody in a positive form it also is a good way for students to be more productive while having fun.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
726191FFAA4A,"School has a variety of activities for students and I think that everyone should participate in at least one of them. The reasons that I think students should participate in an extracurricular activity is that they could learn something, they could find a new interest in one,and they can step out of their comfort zone. If students participate in these activities they may discover new likes,dislikes, and talents that could effect their future.

When people discover something new they often times learn things that could benefit them and those around them. If students do the same thing they could think of new ideas and strategies based on what they have learned. You never know what kinds of things you could learn unless you try something new. Generic_Name has decided to start baseball and he thought of a great strategy that ended up helping them at one of their baseball games. If Generic_Name hadn't joined the baseball team the game would have gone alot differently and their team wouldn't have such a valuable player. This is one of the reasons why I think students should participate in a extracurricular activity.

Some students in the school keep to themselves a lot of time and don't want anything to do with other people. But if they try something new they may find that they like it. Students could find hidden talents that they never knew they had and that could effect their future. Generic_Name is a really quiet student and her parents decided to sign her up for the art club. Generic_Name grew to love the art club and decided to persue a carerr path as an artist. If Generic_Name never joined the art club she would have never found a talent that she had and grew to love. This is another reason why I think students should participate in an extracurricular activity.

Finally, the last reason I think students should participate in an activity is that students can step out of their comfort zone. I think that people should be willing to try new things even if it means stepping out of your comfort zone. You will never learn anything if you avoid other things and people. Generic_Name has never liked any sports but she decide to try vollyball and she ended up really liking it. Generic_Name tried something that she really disliked and ended up changing her opinion on it. This is why I think that students should try one extracurricular activity.

School has many different activities for kids to learn and have fun with. It does'nt matter whether your shy or nervous you can still learn something new and end up enjoying it. This is why I think students should participate in an extracurricular activity.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
C358C5832938,"If my principal has decided that all students had to participate in an extracurricular activity I would disagree with the decision of him or her. All students should have the right to chose to participate in an after or before school activity.

First and for most, an extracurricular activity is something you would do after or before school. If you have something after school say like a family reunion or, a game for another team the people or student's involved in the extracurricular would have trouble committing to the program.

Second, If a family or just the student's had more important stuff to do. Like going home to help the family or, take care of his or her brother or sister because the mom and dad are working late and to, even provide company and care for the family. The extracurricular activity is stopping them to provide support for their family and thank their mom and dad for working so hard every dad just to let me have my siblings.

Third, Students serve seven hours of school five day's a week for the whole year if we were to add the extracurricular activity after school every day students could be going from seven hours of school to eight hours of school. Instead students should be able to go home and do their home work then could play video game's or go out side and explore or go play wiffle ball. how would students enjoy to take one hour out of their free time to do an extracurricular activity then enjoy time with their friend's . My point is extra hours of school is wasting their childhood.

In Conclusion, extracurricular activities will cause people to miss out on stuff even if some of that stuff is not really that important. School in total takes a way some of are child hood and if we add extra time on to that it will fly by. If you do not agree with me then that is OK because we dont need extra after school activity's .  ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A1B546B918F3,"Personally i agree with the principals decision to have all the students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Depending on the activity chosen you could have a lot of fun doing these activities, can help you relax and focus, and help for a long term like trying to get a job or giving a better look to your self due to that extracurricular activity.

Depending on the activity that you do can help you relax and help you focus more during stressful times. these activities could be dancing, playing an instrument or simply reading. The activities are designed so that you could be as calm and focused as possible. The reason that these activities that i stated maybe relaxing to most students is the fact that it could help them go into their own world and escape what could possibly be going on in their life.

Another good reason to do an extracurricular activity is that you could have a lot of fun doing some of these activities. for instance doing the school council or maybe helping a teacher could be fun depending on said students interests. But then there are the students whom find playing a sport witch is great too! It can help keep them active and feeling good.

The last and probably the most important reason that you should do an extracurricular activity is that it can help in the long run. these activities will show up on your job application and possibly your resame in the future. Another way it could help in the future is that it could help by giving you skills that others might not have therefor, giving you the one up on getting that position in the job field they would like to go in.

I feel like the principal did this so that we could succeed in life and say that al the students he\she had had can and will succeed with flying stars. these activities could help us relax and focus more so that we could do well in and out of school. they can allow us to have fun in what we are doing. also,they could help us do well in the future giving us the skills that we could use to be able to succeed in life and school so that we can live well.         ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
7B1A0CEA348A,"Thesis- I disagree with it because students may not have time to do it, may have chores or responsibilites to do after school, and even work in a job after school.

1. Why i say disagree is that students should have the right to choose if they want to participate in a extracurricular activity or not. They should not be forced to do something that they might not like to do. For example, a student is told to participate in a sport or any school extracurricular activity they might like a sport or the school council but if he or a she dont want to then he or she should not be to told to do the extracurricular activity.

2. One of the examples of why i disagree is people really dont got time after school, like teens after school may have to work after school so then they got not going to have time to do anything like a extracurricular activity. Students aswell may not like it because it's to much for them because they might be tired or even stressed out because of the work they did in school for 8 or 7 hours its to much that students mostly likely would like to go home then to stay after school to do extra work.

3. Responsibilites are a other reasons that students don't got time after school. One of the biggest responsibilites is to take care of your sibilings, or clean the house, take out the trash , and even do homework. So much student's dont got time for it because of those responsibilites that they have to do first. When they are done by then they are not even gonna have energy to do stuff after because of how much stuff they already have done.

4. Displince if a other reasons that students dont go time after school. Alot of students get in trouble during school or even after school and that what school need to know is that when students get in trouble in like getting into a fight, an being annoying in classes, an not doing your work and just talk is gonna get u in trouble. All of those displinces are gonna get u in a lot of trouble and students need to learn from that by just not doing nth after school and going straight to his or she house.

5. What im trying to say is that students should have right to say if that they want to do a activity or not because there are alot of stuff that students got to do after school. This was my opinion of the disagree side of students should participate in activitys. To summarize it all up is that, Students got alot of responsibilites to do in life and that how life is that there is alot of responsiblites that must be done first before u can do any activity with your friends or anyone.

600D15606C01,"Do you ever want fun activities to do at school? Having an extracurricular activity helps students that don't want to come to school, encouraging them to come more frequently and enjoy the time they have at school instead of dreading school. I think students having at least one extracurricular activity would be a great idea because, students can learn new things for example playing sports includes learning how to play. Making new friends in other activities like student council , and having interaction with other peers like in the yearbook committee.

First, extracurricular activity can bring students to learn new things about that specific activity and even the things they learned will help them in real life in the near future. For example, FFA can help those students, how to grow crops for food supplies, and how to take care of farm animals like what to feed them that is healthy and nutritious for the animals. Another example is FCCLA helps volunteer at animal shelters or any type of shelter that needs volunteering and even learn how to take care of dogs and cats, how to feed them, and care for those animals that need help.

Second, students can meet new peers and become friends with each other. For example, a group activity that involves five or more people in a group to work on a project, if one student was sitting all by herself and had no one to talk to or work with for that activity and this one person sees them sitting alone at one big table that person might invite her to come sit with them so, they can work on the project together and them two might find they have things income and become friends. Then, that encourages them to help others to become friends.

Lastly, interaction with others is very important in these activities. For example, working in the yearbook committee involves students to talk about what to do and what to put in the yearbooks, taking pictures might involve talking to communicate where the other student will be while taking those pictures, and printing the yearbook out will need learning how to print papers.

These three examples are perfect reasons for having extracurricular activities for each student in the school today. What do you think about having these extra activities at school? Having activities like this encourages them to come everyday and it makes them enjoy school more than not wanting to come. The school can have many different extracurricular activities they can join for example, sports that helps them how to play it right step by step, the student council helps students become friends and have communication skills and the school yearbook committee helps them with interaction, communication, and teaches them how to take pictures on cameras and print out many different things. This is why I think this school and the students should have at least one activity to do during school hours to keep them busy and want to come to school more everyday.            ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
6F29660C48D9,"Your school has just decided to change up the rules a little, now you're required to take an extracurricular activity. You could do anything from sports to student council! Do you think this is fair? When you think about the facts it seems like a good idea. It will encourage students to be more active and participate in sports. It could even bring the students out into the real world and off their phones, and it could really benefit their overall health. In extracurricular activities you usually have to work with other people or collaborate, so they'll even improve the students team building and social skills. I fully support the new change to the school system, I believe many students could be benefited by this change.

Do you play a sport? how'd you find that sport? Many students play a sport that the schools has, for example lacrosse, basketball and football. When you're looking for a new sport it helps when you have friends willing to join with you. Schools have a wide range of sports and it's pretty easy to find one your interested in, and you can join with a couple friends! By joining a sport you could be getting a lot more exercise and spend more time outside you just need a little nudge to start. The schools new rule is that little nudge that you and many of your classmates need.

Many students own cell phones and spend wayyy too much time on them, you could spend hours on your phone and not even notice! The average screen time amount for teens (12-18) is around 6 hours every day. Dont you think its time for a change? It's proven that phone use is one of the leading causes of depressed and anxiety. It's important to live a life outside of your phone. Students who have an extracurricular activity are proven to spend less time on their phones, studies show that by spending more time out in the real world it greatly improves your health and mood. Teens can get really lazy and just sit around on their phones all day. It gets hard to make them do anything else. The extracurricular rule will make it so that they're required to get off their phones out out into the real world!

Do you enjoy making friends and being a part of a group? It's important to have good social skills and practice talking to others. Sometimes it can be really hard to get out there and make friends. Taking an extracurricular activity can really improve your social skills and your team building skills. If you decide to join a sport you can practice a lot of team building and improve your leadership. If sports just are'nt your thing you can try student council, or other fun group building activities! If you're more of an introvert you could try library club or art club! In the activities you're bound to meet a lot of great, caring people who can really help open you up. If you're looking to make friends extracurricular activities are an amazing way to meet new people.

Students really need some encouragement to start doing more activities outside of school. The benefits are never ending and can make you a whole new person! There are thousands of extracurricular options to pick from. students can learn, make friends, improve their health and spend less time on their phones.

It's proven that doing something you love raises your grades because your more confident in yourself, but you wont find something you love without looking. The new rule is just a little head start. Extracuricular activities are the way to go!       ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
0230E2A9E656,"Friends, learning, fun, extracurricular activities provides all of these things. Extracurricular activities such as sports, the student council, and many other clubs are a great way for students to make friends and learn many skills. Many schools have extracurricular activities but not all students will attend them. Some students may not have time, friends to go with, or they just don't want to go. You may feel left out at first when joining a new club, but eventually you will make new friends and have tons of fun learning many skills. I agree with the decision that enforces students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have lots of fun, and learn important skills.

Students should be enforced to participate in extracurricular activities because they will make new friends. In a new school not everybody makes friends right away, so extracurricular activities can be a great way to find friends with similar interests. There are many different clubs and activities filled with people of similar interests. These interests help you bond with your peers as you do activities related to the interest you share. Such as in many sports teams, you won't know all your teammates instantly. As the season goes on you will begin to learn more about them as you bond with them. Teams can never be great if the players always fight with each other. You must learn to work together as a team to win and in doing so you will become much closer to each other. At the end of the season you will realize, the teammates who started out complete strangers turn out to being some of your best friends. Extracurricular activities can be a great way for many students to find many friends while bonding in their similar interests.

Students should be enforced to participate in extracurricular activities because they will have lots of fun. As there are many different extracurricular activities, surely you will find one that suits your interests. Instead of doing these activities alone you will have friends to do them with. Doing things by yourself isn't always the best. Sometimes the things you loved might not be fun, but when your with friends they will make things interesting. It won't be the same boring game with the same story line every time. Things will be different, interesting, there will be change, and you will have more fun. You might have been the best at a video game at your old school, but as you will be introduced to new people in the club you might find someone on a similar level. The old spark that died out is back to life as you want to improve. The game that became too easy it was no longer fun, now has some challenge and your interest is back. Extracurricular activities can be a great place to have tons of fun renewing your interests, finding new interests, and spending time with friends.

Students should be enforced to participate in extracurricular activities because they can learn many important and essential skills. Extracurricular activities provide a way for you to learn and enhance many skills. As you begin to learn the skills needed for each activity you may struggle to improve, but your peers are there for you. They can provide useful information and tips on how they learned these skills and improved. If you were already great at the activity you may find rivals and competition. Extracurricular activities can help you discover others as talented as you. The rivalries that build up help you improve as you strive to become better than everyone. As you strive to become the best, other people with work to become better than you. Furthermore, the whole community will be improving and learning new skills. Extracurricular activities can be a great place to learn new skills and enhance the skills that were learned through rivalry, competition, and help from peers.

Extracurricular activities are essential to students as they help create friendships, are a great place to have fun, and teach many essential skills. Extracurricular activities bring friends together with the similar interest that they share. Those interests bring joy and fun as they do them with their friends. They learn many new skills from others as they may have more experience and knowledge. They grow and enhance their skills through rivalries and competition. Extracurricular activities are a great and necessary part of a students life.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
74A11372794B,"Extracurricular Activities

At dismissal time, my principle made an announcement saying that all students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Do you agree with this decision?

Well, I don't agree with this decision and here are my three reasons why.

My first reason is that extracurricular activities would affect our sleep time.

Although it can keep students busy and organized, students would have less time to sleep.

For example, my friend Generic_Name stays after school for a sport, and he also babysits his little brother, he comes to school tired everyday, but if he didn't do the extracurricular activity and had more sleep time, he would not be tired everyday.

Because students don't get enough sleep, some students come to school late.

Over seventy percent of students fall asleep in school, thirty percent of students come to school late, and forty percent of the students that fall asleep in class participate in extracurricular activities.

My second reason is that you would have less time for homework.

For example, I played basketball.

It was Thursday night right after my game and I had a quiz the following day.

The homework was for me to study over my notes for my quiz tomorrow, but by the the time I got home, it was time for me to go to bed.

The next day arrived and I took the test...and failed it, If i would have not played basketball, I would have had time to study, and I most likely would've passed my test.

My third and final reason is you would have less time to spend with family and friends.

They are most important, family and friends don't mean anything unless you spend time with them.

One day I wanted to stay after school for basketball, but I also wanted to go to my niece first birthday party.

It was a hard choice, but I had to stay back for basketball.

Only if I did not participate in any extracurricular activities, I could have been at my niece first birthday party and supported her.

In conclusion, all students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities.

It causes less time with family and friends, sleep time, and lees time for homework.

Some kids at the school may not think of the sports as something to do or dont like there school team and could think its not for them to play on a school team or they just cant do it at all . Although, kids might not wanna do sports at all and think itÃâº a bad team or it just not the type of things they prefer to do . Most children like staying home and playing games or doing other fun things or just eat a lot of food and be lazy but possibly , kids are having a busy life and have to do things and do not have time for the sports like help grandparents or siblings or just watch over the house while no ones there. It may be a bit hard for them to get into any sports if students cant control their actions as in helping or showing there doing something or communication or even able to focus and do what there supposed to do in the sports rules . Also, some students might not like sports at all they might disagree with what things the players do like the body movements or the way their stretching or they just dont like the feeling in sports or activities as in some may not like moving around a lot or they may be out of shape or just have bad health so they think their not going to get anything done or think their not fit for sports .Mean while, some kids may think their not good enough as other students or cant move like them or be as focus when their doing things.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
DC4F866EBACB,"Have you ever heard of that loner in high school who had no friends? Maybe you are imagining the ""nerd"" who ate lunch in the bathroom or always sat alone. Maybe you were that person. Don't you think that life would've turned out a bit differently for them if they would've had a group of people who stood by them? A group of people with similar passions and interests? If they were given a little push to join a club or to be around people that understood them, maybe they would feel more at home in a scary place like high school. I strongly agree that it should be mandatory for students to participate in extracurricular activities in school. Not only does it provide a safe community for those who might need it most, it also provides people with life long friends, and could lead to a healthier lifestyle.

As sad as it is, sometimes home isn't the best place for kids. People might seem fine, but in reality, they could have a terrible home life. Whether it is abuse, addiction, divorce, or just plain fighting, home could truly be a scary place. Sometimes when things get hard for teenagers, they might turn to drugs, drinking, or partying as a coping mechanism. Behaviors like these are dangerous to the teenagers themselves and people around them. Even though this may seem like an extreme, some kids go as far as joining gangs or running away from home as a way to escape what's truly happening to them. Joining a club could really help kids like this. Having something to look forward to, or having a place to go after school could be very beneficial. Children might discover passions that they never knew they even had. Kids who have been hurt from a young age might think that everyone lets them down or that no one truly cares about them. Having a safe haven with people who push you to succeed and never give up on you, could be the best thing to ever happen to them.

Another benefit of being in an extracurricular activity is making friends. High school can be a terrifying place for people who are perceived as ""different."" From a young age, you are taught to fit in. Being ""weird"" or being ""special"" sets you apart from others. As soon as someone brands you as the ""weird kid,"" you are stuck with that title for a long time. Whether you look different, act different, or are just plain shy, it can be difficult to make genuine friends in a place with people who are artificially perfect. Being around people who you know will accept you and understand you is crucial when growing up. We are still figuring out who we are and who we are going to be. Having people look at you funny can put certain things into question, that they might have ever even noticed before.

Being in a space where everyone shares the same values, and where everyone has the same goal, could be an amazing thing to happen to someone. They will no longer feel like an outcast when everyone starts to see eye to eye. Feeling alone in the world is such a scary thing when you are young. Having a place where they can be themselves, is what every child deserves.

Something that teens have and are still facing to this day is negative body image. Unrealistic standards of beauty are hazardous for young people's mental health. In this day and age, pretty much every teenager is on social media. Teenage brains are still developing and are very impressionable, and all the information that we see is immediately stuck with us for a long time. Seeing models or just thin people on our phones for hours, can be one of the most dangerous things that could happen to someone's well being. Society forces young people, especially young girls, to look a certain way. If they don't fit that mold, they are told that they are ugly, fat, or disgusting. Forcing people to only see one example of what the human body should look like is one of the worst mistakes that we have collectively made as a society.

Pictures, videos, and billboards show one type of person. Skinny. They don't show the reality of it. They don't show what they looked like before. They don't tell you how that person got like that. All they do is show a skinny person smiling trying to sell you products to make you look like them. Whether the product are diet pills, waist trainers, or some type of cleanse, things like these are exactly why so many people fall into eating disorders. So many young people starve themselves or purge to look like the people they see on an everyday basis. People miss out on what it feels like to just be a kid. They shouldn't feel guilty for eating a slice of cake or drinking one can of soda. They shouldn't second guess every eating decision that they make. In a world where both obesity, and unhealthy eating habits are the norm, it is hard to find a medium. Being involved in a sport that you enjoy can help fix problems like these. It is way better for your body to exercise instead of depriving yourself from food. Finding a sport that they love and are good at is important to start leading a healthier lifestyle. Not only will they be able to find people who love it as much as they do, forming a strong bond with people who check up on them can help them heal and get better.

In conclusion, making extracurricular activities mandatory for students could be really beneficial for them. Having a place to feel comfortable is exactly what a kid needs. It helps them to have a safe place to go, make friendships that will last forever, and it could even promote a healthier lifestyle.

068B2C038555,"Kids 50% of the time have lots of stress to to the point of anxiety, because they have too much things to do. Well by going through with this idea you are basically encouraging this.

I disagree with this idea because we will have way too much stress, our grades would plummet, and all this overworking could lead to depression.

Kids already have a lot on their plate. So now if there is another thing they have to do it could seriously stress them out. See we can't handle stress they are not used to it, but now that they have to take time to do an extracurricular activity it could be way too much for us. All this stress can also lead to anxiety. Anxiety is a terrible thing so thats why you cannot force us to do an extracurricular activity because it could lead to kids getting anxiety which is just terrible. So if we do have to do an extracurricular activity we would have way too much stress and eventually get anxiety.

Our grades could get seriously affected by this. We could go from A's to C's and Eventually to F's. This is because we will be busy doing our extracurricular activities instead of having time to study,or having time to finish a project/essay that is worth over half our grade. If we start getting bad grades it could turn into a habit that we keep in high school. Which if we do keep this habit it could lower our chances of getting into a good college. Which could destroy our future.

By forcing each kid to do an extracurricular activity they could feel so overwhelmed and sad they become depressed. Depression is just so sad and all of us could avoid ever feeling depressed in our lives as long as you don't make us do an extracurricular activity that will probably take up half of our day. The other half would go to trying to finish our homework/projects/essays for school. You see in that schedule there is no time that they have to spend with their loved once, or do things we love. That will really take a toll on a person. They will have no time to do anything except do their extracurricular activity,and trying to finish our schoolwork. This depression will just keep on chipping away at the person, and they will never be able to go back to feeling happiness. All because they had to do an extracurricular activity that took away all their time.

Mr. Principal there are many reasons you shouldn't make everyone do an extracurricular activity but the most prevalent to students are having a bucketload of stress, our grades would plummet, and all this overworking could lead to depression. See all these reasons will have a serious effect on kids mental state. We are only 13-14 we cannot handle this type of stress and overworking.

Kids should have fun with there activitys in school, maybe most of the day should be learning and some of it can be having fun. I also disagree because some kids dont like sports, or working on the yearbook, and some kids dont want to serve for the student council. Alot of kids are diffrent so they should have more options, like reading books, painting, or even designing clothes. Also it depends on what grade level the students are in because all of this is preparing them for when they are adults. I play sports and that keeps me occupied by keeping my mind off of other things. Most kids should not be forced to do something they dont like, they should do something that they like. Then the students are failing that class because they dont like it and that is not good. So we should add more options to shool activitys for the students can do better. Please help the students have a great time at school, it shouldnt be a cage it should be a little free. School is supposed to be fun so help the students out parent and teachers.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
4F2438C131F2,"Imagine your'e principal made extracurricular activities outside of school mandatory, activities outside of school can be a good way to socialize with your'e peer's, but there are some drawbacks to forced extracurricular activities. Activities outside of school can be a good thing if they are willingly done by the person, compared to being forced into doing an activity. Studies have shown that if someone is forced into doing a selected activity, they wouldn't enjoy it as much as they would compared to the person doing the activity willingly. Some student's already are doing things outside of school such as, helping at their local food bank, volunteering at their church, or they could just be leading a small study group. There are some student's out there that aren't interested in doing anything outside of school either because they can't or they just don't want to do anything after dismissal time. For some student's, activities outside of school could really help their social skills by exposing them to a new environment, with new people, and new challenges to face. In conclusion doing things outside of school could be a good thing for students if they do it willingly and if there are many options to choose from,not just activities associated with school, but continuous activities in the community too.

When doing activities outside of school there can be many things to choose from. Some activities that student's can get involved in outside of school may include volunteering at a local non-profit, organizing a study group, or it could be as simple as doing a sport, the possibilities are virtually endless! If your'e principal made it so that the extracurricular activity was some how associated with school, there are still plenty of options out there. Some activities that may be associated with your'e local school may include sports, yearbook club,National Junior Honor Society, or even a chess club, there is still a lot you can do after school, but not as many activities you could do that isn't associated with school. There are some districts that have already implemented this into their schools, which for most of the schools they had to add more clubs that fit the students interests. A resent study shows that the students who did extracurricular activities preformed better on a social IQ test compared to students who didn't do any activities outside of school. If schools did implement this change they would need more staff to lead the clubs or to form new clubs to fit the students needs, thats why it would be best if the school system stayed the same with a few minor changes to the systems.

Activities can be healthy for students, if the students like what they are doing. Students may not want to do things after school, except to just go home. While there are some kids who absolutely love to do things outside of school because it can be a good social experience for them. A survey recently done by a New York institute, seventy five percent of the time when teens are forced into something they resent and do the opposite of what is told of them. To sum every thing up, The school systems should allow the students to have free choice of what they do, schools need to make the kids of tomorrow more independent and allow them to choice their own path of what they want to do.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
BBB2C5E7B286,"An extracurricular activity is an activity that you do outside of your normal everyday life. It could at school during school hours, after school, or with another program on the weekends. I think that you should have to participate in an extracurricular activity so your life is more full. You will be more involved in the school, it will be fun, and you can be happy by doing so. It will also raise the school spirit and get it flowing within the school and in the community.

By be part of an extracurricular activity you will be more involved. You would be more involved because you are doing more than just coming to school, doing work, and going home to do it over again. You have more to do than just schoolwork.

When you are involved, you are having fun. Extracurricular activities can range anywhere from doing the school newspaper, to being of the football team, or joining a local scout troop. There is an activity outside of school for almost anything. Whatever your taste there is probably an activity for it so you can have fun doing what you want. It may take some time to find he right one, but whatever you like to do, there is for sure an activity for it.. No matter what the activity is, when you are doing it and like it, you will be having fun.

You can be happy when you feel involved in things and are having fun. It has been proven that when you are involved in things you feel happier than you did before. For an example...

You weren't involved with any extracurricular activities and you had nothing to do when you got home nut talk to your friends when they were done with there sports. You felt something missing, so you decided to go play baseball that spring. You made the team and you were liking the game. You felt happier with yourself than you did when you weren't doing anything before.

Things like these do happen, and they happen to a lot of people too. You can have so much fun when doing an extracurricular activity.

In closure, extracurricular activities can be so much fun and be a big part of your life. They are fun, exciting, involving, and make you happy. I think that every school should make you do some sort of extracurricular activity in or out of school. They are really fun and make change the way you go and do things.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
127C44A70BAC,"You now have to sign up for a extracurricular activity at school. You don't want to sign up for one because you already have a lot to do at home, you don't want to stress yourself out more than you already are. Why do you have to do this when you don't want to? Should kids have to do an extracurricular activity? I think they shouldn't because it could cost money and its their choice if they want to.

One reason its a bad idea is it could cost money for either the kid or the parent. In a recent survey that the Boston Globe did said that parents are less likely to sign up for an activity that cost over 100 dollars. I think this is the most important reason, parents shouldn't have to spend money. Maybe they are in a tough time and don't have a lot of money to spend on sports equipment. Most sports you sign up for you have to buy equipment or there is a sign up fee. If there is a free activity, sure they can do that, but most sports cost money. If the parents want to spend that money, they can. I'm not saying they shouldn't, I'm just saying it could cause problems for less fortunate families.

Another reason is its the students decision if they want to be involved in a extracurricular activity. A study conducted by the Harvard Institute of Science reported back that most teenagers don't want to do something they are forced to do. I think this is also important because if a teenager doesn't want to do something, they will do anything not to do it. For example, if I am being forced to do something, I most likely don't want to do it. If a teenager wanted to do an activity, they would. I don't think parents should force their kids to do something, unless its chores or something like that.

Some people argue that doing extracurricular activities can improve your experience at school. Most highschoolers say school is more enjoyable when you do extracurricular activities. I think this is a good argument but, some kids could still find it not enjoyable. Say they wanted to do on activity but it filled up so they got placed into something they didn't want to do. That person probably won't have as much fun as they would have had in the one they wanted to do.

The activities could put stress on some students which can be harmful to their mental health says the LA Times. If the stress that these activities could put on the students can be harmful to them, then they shouldn't be forced to do that activity.

I don't think students should be forced to do activities because it could cost money and its their choice what they want to do and don't want to do. If these activities can cause harm to student's mental health, why do it? Do these activities truly help with school stress? Can they really make school feel better even if it can add more stress to students? I don't think its worth it, do you think it is?",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Should or shouldn't students participate in an extracurricular

?"",well I think that they should participate in an extracurricular because they can earn points or things for participating in these things, having something to do in their spare time, supporting the school and making it better for the students to be there, not to be having a very free scheulcle becuase they could be playing sports and maybe they would make it into the NFL or other sports related things.

Therefore, students could be having a free period doing nothing. Instead they could be doing something in there mean time and doing a interesting circular. For them wanting to do a extracurricular, my idea would be having to have them write on a piece of paper saying what they would mostly want to be doing for a extracurricular. After that we would pick the most wrote extracurriclar to do and giving everyone 1 week vote for which curricular they want and then we give would them that activity to do for a whole 2 semester.

For the student council and yearbook club, they would each have specific job. Yearbook kids would have a limited amount of kids because everyone would need to have a skill that helps them get done with the yearbook. This is why becuase they want to be walking around doing nothing with the camera. Student councils would be having a specific job to do like having to be controlling the announcement and deciding should they should they not have dress code.

Therefore students are needed to be payed attention to and have an opinion because they can all hate the school and not having to make they're own decision. They should have a choice to be choosing between what they love and being free to be doing there favorite thing to do. There is a error that would be coming through because sometimes they're friends would want to be doing the something that there friends are but if there friend s doesnt like it they can change it for themselves. Sometimes younger people doesnt like doing anything but just them a change for having to do something they like to do. Myself doesnt like doing extracurricular but I still have to do it. Some of them might be doing but you have to put a smile on your face to be saying that you are enjoying it.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
F3C678637DCE,"Imagine having an activity to do other than school, like sports or working on the yearbook. Our principal is encouraging us to have an extracurricular activity to do to boost ourselves! I think it's a great idea to have students work while having fun. There are many advantages for doing an extracurricular activity. For example, students will have more exercise, which is great for the body, a club can boost creative minds and students are able to get along with each other more.

Joining a school sport is a great way to get exercise and learn new skills. Doing a sport in school not only gives us kids something to do with our life, but makes us a better teammate and a leader. When I first heard about a new softball team in school, I was so excited to try out and play for the team. I only had a few friends on the team, but by the end of the season, I had made new friends and I learned new skills. Leadership is very important for someone to learn. It teaches the person that not everything is about them and that sometimes, you have to take one for the team. If someone makes a mistake, don't put them down for it, encourage or teach them how to be successful next time. Sports in school is a great way to learn new skills and be healthy.

Doing something creative is a great way to be competitive and entertained. Having art clubs or working in the yearbook can be really fun! Some of my friends work in the yearbook and they have so much fun while taking pictures and creating a great collage. Everyone just haves a good time. Also, participating in art clubs can really boost someone's creative mind. Kids get to create their own masterpieces and show it off to everyone! Students will get to observe and examine their competitors art work to get ideas or to just admire it. Doing something creative is good for the mind and soul.

Lastly, There are a lot of social aspects to these activities. Imagine being in a student council where you can talk about requests and complaints to make the school a better place for students like you and I. Other students can vote for each other to be in the council and it'll cause some competition, but it's good that students can talk to each other. Joining a sport or a club of any kind can be really positive for the child. They can make new friends with the same interests and gain their confidence in what they do. Having a social life in school is important.

Our principal wants us to join extracurricular activities and I think it's a great idea! It can teach new leadership skills, boost creativity, and of course, being more social and making new friends. Having an activity to do is a great way to have fun. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
7F22BF0859BB,"I strongly agree with principal's decision about participating in extracurricular activities.

First, extracurricular activity will help you learn a second set of skill, and those skills will be a good reference for you now and in the future. For example, Joining clubs, sports team, and volunteering implies that you are very talented and a self confident person by that i mean you want to make a change to your life,unlike those who don't want to work hard, try to change themselves and fix there mistakes, rise up, and those who want to be a loser. We now live in the 21st century its our job to be a leader and lead our future generations, by getting a firsthand experience of our future career and becoming a better person. There are many clubs you can join that matches your personality, if you like cyber security you can join a club like cyber patriot, and if you really like building join a S.T.E.M club. You never have to worry about not joining a club ever because there are more clubs you can participate in, than the total number of star in the whole galaxy combined, in my calculation .

Next, joining extracurricular activities will help defeat boredom, studies have shown that nearly all kids experience some sort of boredom in there life more than adults. The reason for that is that kids don't do anything outside of school that is working to strengthening their brains, adults on the other hand are very hard working and outgoing, they work day and night to get us going by and have a good life . Not working and challenging your brain is one reason why kids do bad in school, the students ability to do out of the box thinking is lacking due to not learning and doing anything new out. Your brain is a pretty big blob of muscles and if you don't give it a workout by doing something new, soon your brain weaken and you wont be able to get anything in it .Try not to take your brain for granted, do something new before your brain becomes too lazy to function properly.

In addition, doing a extra activities is really good, but it shouldn't be a distraction for you, this means that you still need to do your homework, study for any test, and turn in any work on time. Extra curricular mean doing and learning something extra in your free time and doing school and academic work as well and succeed. And if you can't handle anything extra, tell your principal and a trusted adult that you can't handle it, and they will understand. Doing extra is not necessarily better, your health matters most, if you feel good go right ahead and do it,but if you feel not so good no one can force you to do it.

Finally , today we discussed the many positives about doing an extra activity, like I mentioned those positive can be both long term and short term but sometimes extra can mean a lot of stress to some people, like I always say ""do whats best for you"". Life is not about what you do , it's about how you do things and if you like it or not. Despite the bad things, the principle decision about doing extra is really helpful for everyone in many ways.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
F2A039D4E087,"Students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because it causes unneeded stress, it takes time away from studying, and it leads to injuries. Why cant we just have the student attend class as usual. They can always sign up if they think they're up for the challenge. Imagine a young straight A girl signing up for lacrosse, she ends up loving it but at what cost? Now she has to practice everyday after school instead of studying, Then she got a C on the test. Now she broke her wrist and is struggling to take notes in class, see what this leads to?

Students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because it causes unneeded stress. When a person is stressed out it is hard for them to concentrate on another topic because theyre so worried on what's stressing them out. The same goes for students. when they're sitting at their desk working on an assignment it's almost impossible to concentrate when they're thinking about something else. That can lead to late or missing assignments that cause their grade to lower. When a student is in an extracurricular activity they also have assignments they need to work on whether its improving a move in sports or writing a speech for debate they have to work on that as well as their assignments from class.

Students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because they will have less time to study. If student cant study as long it will also bring down their grade which, no one wants. When in an extracurricular activity it isn't rare to have to work with a partner. When you work with another person you have to change your schedule to cooperate with theirs. It can also be very frustrating if they dont like each other. Some extracurricular activities leave during class which can cause a disruption in the classroom, and makes the student miss the work or notes during the time of their ascents.

Students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because it can lead to injuries. If they join a sport they could hurt their arms, legs, and even head. Those injuries are very hard to deal with while in school, and make it even harder to focus and succeed. Its not just if you are apart of a sport it could also be stuff such as theater arts, or debate. In those you have to move around furniture or props which could lead to an injury. When a student has an injury they might have to miss a couple days of school and have to catch up. They could also have a hard time moving around the school and writing.

Student shouldn't be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because it causes unneeded stress that distracts from learning, it takes times away from studying which can lower their grades, and they can get injuries that make it more challenging to concentrate and learn to the best of their abilities. If we force students to join an extracurricular activity then we are just hurting them when we should be making them stronger. We cant let students suffer so we need to fight to insure this never happens.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
4DB5B49E56D4,"I agree with the principal that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. There are a couple reasons why I agree. These include it's a great way to stay active, meet new people, and try new things. In addition, there is such a wide variety of options. You can join a sports league, a dancing or singing group, or even a chess club. There are so many others that you probably don't even know about and one way to learn more about them is to try them.

The first reason that I agree is it's a great way to stay physically active. Staying physically active is one of the most important things in life. If you are not staying active and exercising you are not being healthy. Especially as kids and young teens, you don't want to develop bad habits and get on the wrong path. If you start developing good habits at a young age you are more likely to stick with those habits as you get older. Joining a sports group would be a great way to stay in shape or even get back into shape. Another great way is to start a sports group or club. There are a lot of great ways to stay active and stay healthy. Just devoting a small amount of time to exercise everyday can be very beneficial.

The second reason that I agree is it's the perfect chance to be socially active. Joining a club like math or chess club is a great way to meet new people and make new friends. It is also a great way to meet people that share a common interest with you. Being social is a very important role in having a healthy life. It is good to be social. You can meet new people that you have never met or even learn that you and someone you already knew enjoy the same activity. Plus, meeting new people will help you later in life like getting a job. In addition, sometimes you have to meet people in life that you don't want to meet.

The third reason that I agree is it's a great way to get out of your comfort zone. It's important to try new things and go out of your comfort zone. If you never try new things you won't know whether you even like them. If you try something and you dont like it, so what, then at least you know that you dont like it. Whereas if you dont try it, you won't know if you like it. It's good to try new things because you might even meet someone that enjoys that same thing as you. It is also completely normal to not want to try new things and that is called fear. There is always a fear in trying something new because you dont know the outcome or what will happen. The important thing is to push that fear and nervousness aside and take the risk.

The fourth reason that I agree is it will help you in the future. When you are older you are going to have to meet people whether you want to or not, you are going to have to do things even if you dont feel like it, you are going to have to try new things even if you don't want to, and if you have lived your whole life never meeting people you dont feel like meeting, never doing things that you dont want to do, or never trying new things, when you are older it will be even harder. So, if you do these things when you are young it will be easier to handle them once you are an adult. As an example, if you started trying new things when you were young it won't be any different once you are older. Whereas if you didn't try new things when you were young, when you are older it may be very difficult.

Students have a lot of things to accomplish every day, especially school work. After a long and stressful day at school, going to participate in an extracurricular activity is perfect. Kids need time to just be kids and have a little fun. I think that all the students having to do an extracurricular activity is a great idea and would bring the school closer together. I also think it's a great way to just get away from everything. Have a little fun, meet new people, and try new things.

In conclusion, I agree that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I think that it's a great idea and can be very beneficial for yourself, your friends, and overall the whole community. It would be a great way to stay physically active, stay socially active, try new things, and help prepare you for the future. Many students already participate in extracurricular activities and if they can, then anyone can. Even though there might be a few possible negative outcomes, like you get embarrassed or people make fun of you, the possible positive outcomes are worth the risk. If you never take risks and try new things you will never find new activities and hobbies that you enjoy. For all of these reasons I agree and support the principals proposal and hope that you will too.            ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
089F4D797A5E,"My principal has decided that I have to join an extracurricular activity. I do not agree with this and think this should be banned. It is not fair,most people are busy after school,and it is WAY too stressful.

1 It is not fair. No one should be forced to join an extracurricular activity and it is not fair to force someone to give up their free time to join an extracurricular activity. Quite frankly it is not American our, founding fathers fought and died for our country risked being hanged by the British just so WE the people can CHOOSE so we can have freedom and not be forced to do anything.

2 Most people are busy after school. whether it's watching your siblings,working,other activities/hobbies,religious activities,chores other classes, or scouting people are very busy and can't do an extracurricular activity. And a lot of .those things require work,effort,time and it is impossible to do all those things when you are forced to join an extracurricular activity.

3 It is very stressful. People have way too many classes,it often requires you to meet after school,it could require some kind of leadership position,and if you have weak social skills this could be a terrible thing. I know it would stress me out,I just want to go home do my homework,drink my soda,an watch television,I don't want to be stressed.

Quite frankly it is not American,is it truly right for us to be forced to do anything,if so are we any better than the British? Our founding fathers died for our freedoms. So no we arent and that is why I think it should be banned.        ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
1B0AA9A7628F,"Students are lonely, lazy, and are in trouble more these days. With these things at hand depression and suicide percents are flying up. What can we do about that, extracurricular activities. Our principal has recently decided that we have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree that students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity because they can make new friends, be more productive, and it will keep children out of trouble.

Extracurricular activities will make adolescents new friends. Doing and extracurricular activity will expose kids to other children their age, this will expose them to new friends and new relationships causing bonding and friendship. Whenever I am exposed to new people i have fun with them and we share are similarities and a friendship is usually born. When children have friends they tend to be happier whether its one or many, and it cant hurt to have more friends. I think when children are around their peers they are happier and work harder.

When children engage in extracurricular activities they are more productive. They will have fun doing these activities but they will benefit too. Children can and will work harder after being exposed to extracurricular activities, it will exercise their brain more making them work harder and more efficiently. This will improve test and quiz scores because of the increased work ethic.

Participating in extracurricular activities will keep students out of trouble. Being in an extracurricular activity takes a lot of time away, when you do a sport you have to go to practices after school and games on weekends. Sports take away ten plus hours a week away from your normal routine. Ten hours is a lot of time to get away from bad influences and bad situations. You are less likely to get in bad situations if you are away from them, and doing an extracurricular activity is a perfect way to get away.

Participating in extracurricular activities is a good thing because kids can make new friends, they can be more productive, and it will keep children out of trouble.

9C6F949B27D9,"Although, participating in a extracurricular activity like sports,yearbook, and student council, it may not be the best for everyone. Some kids prefer not to play for a basketball,soccer, or volleyball team, It's not one of their comfort zones or something that they enjoy. Everyone has thier personal opinios,and people shold be recpect that. You can't force someone to do something if they don't want to do it, they would not be enjoying their time. Kids should be doing something fun,something they can enjoy, and something they can look back on as a good memory. Thats a big part of being a part of a club or team. Therefore, I disagree with the decison that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Asthma, Asthma is a shortness of breathe or someone having trouble breathing. People with

Asthma may not be capable or comfortable playing a sport where it involves intense running or a lot of movement. Some people don't acknowledge how hard it is to be playing becasue they dont have

Asthma, and don't know the struggles of it. They would be able to play but it would be involving a risk, anything could happen. For example if someone chose to play soccer, and the coach is making them run 10 laps, they can faint or just fall on the floor due to shortness of breathe. Students may not be having the time in day to stay after school for a a sport. Parents come home from a long,busy,tiring,and stressful day at work. They shouldn't have to pick their kid up from something that they don't even want to do, its just a waste of time for the kid and parent.

Yearbook , some people can define or express it to be as a fun,exciting, and an adventures thing to do.

Yearbooks are full of happy memorys thorughout the school year, all put into one little book. It also has pictures of teachers and students, so you can see your friends,teachers,and staff members. Sadly, not all people enjoy it, they think its boring, annoying, and a waste of time. People who like it will be putting amazing effort into it to come out beautifly, and people who dont care, their work is going to be sloppy because, they didn't put any effort into it. Why get someone who dosen't care, when you can get someone who does.

When students are serving as a student council ,

they will be taking advantage of it. Most students are very immature and should not be trusted with a serious job. What I mean by immature is that they would be goofing around a lot, not focus, and would be taking it as a joke. In order to do the job right they should be needed to find someone more mature, someone that they can trust, and someone who will do the job right and someone who will take it seriously. If someone dosen't have a choice to do it, and that's their only option they wont be doing a good job. It's better to get someone who can take the job seriously,and not fool around.

In conclusion, I disagree with the principals final decision to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree because,

Students may not be having the time in day to stay after school for a a sport. Parents come home from a long,busy,tiring,and stressful day at work. They shouldn't have to pick their kid up from something that they don't even want to do, its just a waste of time for the kid and parent.

Why get someone who dosen't care, when you can get someone who does. When students are serving as a student council, they will be taking advantage of it.

477129D4EF86,"YES I think kids should do extracurricular activities this is why I agree with the the decision to make kids do at least one extra curricular activity. I feel like kids should always have something to do so they don't feel lonely or get bored. I think this because if they don't have a extracurricular activity to do they might sit at home all day or get into gang activities. I also think kids should play sports. I think this because its a stress reliever and kids with a lot of stress from home or school should play to get there minds off of things. The last reason is extracurricular like sports or after school helps kids make friends. If you play sports or go to after school you can make new friends or meet new people while your playing.

2. I think extra curricular activities are funny why wouldn't you wanna do them they can help you with things like stress and depression. I think they are fun because there are plenty of options and you can pick the one you like the most. The most popular option is to play sports but you can also do student council and yearbook or go to after school. If you are serious about sports you can maybe go to a collage and go professional if your good. If you do yearbook it can also help your journalism skills. The student council can help you become a leader and work on leadership skills. So as you can see extra curricular activities can help you with your future.

3.

The bad things about being at home all day is that you might not want to look for a job. If your at home all day you might be to lazy to look for a job. I also believe is you are at home all day you can become depressed and feel lonely. If your at home all day you want have anybody to talk to and you'll feel alone. If your at home all day you either sleep eat or play video games. The bad thing about that is your young and can make better use of your time. If your asleep all day your day goes by fast and your already on to the next day. The bad thing about eating all day is that you can get over weight and most people dont want that.

4.

The most common thing kids do when they are home all day is play video games. There is nothing wrong with that but most kids sit there for hours just playing and some barley get any sleep. The worst thing that can happen is that you get involved with gangs. When some kids have nothing to do or are getting bullied they go to a gang. Its not hard to get into a gang you just have to find people in one and they'll give you an initiation.

These are just a couple of reasons why extracurricular activities are good for kids. They can help your future and make sure you stay out of trouble. If you plan on doing some of these things it would be good to start young to have more time to improve. The most exciting career path for me is sports you just have to be dedicated and have a hard work ethic. This is why i agree with this idea.                                                                                                                                                                                  ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
D16ED602B018,"I think

I argee with this active because some people don't like to do things they just like to chill out and sit around and we need more people do things like year book singing then just having less people do more work and it hard having less people do all the work in days because not everyone likes do things by them self.

Since there are not a lot a people around to do the yearbook singing we need more to acutally parttacipate in other actives so the can pass the grade and move on so the fail the resouce that they are in becaus if you fail that resouce then you can't move on to the next they won't let you until you pass the resouce.

And the reason why would have more people because we dont have that many people to do things around here in the school because you only have few people doing jobs around here an we need more people do help out the job that people are giving like cleaning the cafeteria and do more putting pictures in the year books.

Because there is no way that everything can be done by two or three people. we need help because everything that people have done to this school is awsome we just need more people to do more things than having less people do all the work and it takes forever to get the actives done. I think we should just have more people partrticpate in the actives that are being the principal have giving us instead of having less people doing all the work. I think that would be a good idea to have more people joing in on the actives. then just having less people partcipate in the actives that are giving. this why i argee with this idea.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
03B55D3B695B,"Do you want to know what happens when you have a generation of overachievers? I believe that every student should do at least one extracurricular activity. If all students did at least one you would have so many accomplished people and overachievers. The reason why students should do this is because they will meet new people, be able to put activities on their resume, as well as being generally happier.

Whenever students gather they end up meeting and talking to new people. Therefore mandatory extracurricular activities would also give students the opportunity to meet new people and make new friends. For example I have friends from my soccer team that I would have never met if I didn't play soccer. In general there are so many other people that you will never know if you don't do this kind of activities.

Something else that extracurricular activities have is the ability to strengthen your resume. I've seen what effects activities you do outside school hours actually have on your life. Not too long ago my brother got a job just because he did French and DECA. Him getting the job was the direct result of the Extracurricular work that he did. Making it mandatory would give a whole lot more students a chance at young success.

Studies show that doing extracurricular activities generally leads to happiness. I can personally say that this statement is true in my life. Which would mean it's probably true in the lives of others. So if schools want to make students feel that school is more enjoyable, this is the way to go. Especially since happier people also leads to higher productivity than bored or upset people.

Essentially extracurricular activities should be mandatory. Not only do they give students a chance to meet new people and make new friends. It also gives people a better chance at success and A strong resume. Not only these things but they also increase peoples' happiness. Essentially extracurricular activities are win for everyone and should not be overlooked.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
140E9C687F68,"Last school year, over 92 percent of students at my school participated in extracurricular clubs and activities.

After being surveyed, it was found that 98 percent of the students involved in clubs would recommend their activity to others.

Students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities because they allow a student to discover or pursue something they enjoy, learn commitment towards an activity, apply it to many things outside of the club, and still have time to do other things after school.

One reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is they can pursue, or discover an activity that they enjoy participating in.

Two years ago, I joined yearbook club because my best friend was in it.

Starting out, I didn't think that I would enjoy it at all because I don't like editing.

Luckily, I was assigned to help take photos for the yearbook, and soon after joining, I discovered how much I enjoyed photography, which I would not have discovered if I hadn't joined that club. Most schools offer a wide variety of activities, like student council, chess club, or sports teams.

After gathering information from over 250 schools across the country, it was found that the average number of activities and clubs offered at each school was 21.

A few schools had almost 40!

Extracurricular activities are a great way for students to find something they love, or for students to get involved with their school, and with so much choice, there is something for everyone.

Another reason all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities is students can learn a new skill not taught in school, and students learn commitment towards something they sign up for.

Most schools require students to take five core classes and two electives.

Many students use their electives to earn credits they need to graduate, like language courses, and fine arts classes.

Some students enjoy these classes, but there are plenty of students who do not enjoy them.

Requiring students to join a club would allow students to learn a skill or participate in an activity that they would not otherwise have time in their schedule to do.

In addition, extracurricular activities teach students the importance of commitment.

Last year, my sister signed up for the Eco-action club, and she was required to sign a commitment form that made her stay with the club and attend all semester.

She learned through that experience that it was important to find an activity she enjoyed and stay commited to it in order to get the most out of it.

Some students believe that they can join an activity, and switch whenever they feel like it, however this causes a lot of disruption to the people who are committed to the club, and does not allow the student to learn a new skill.

Requiring students to stay in one activity all semester would teach the importance of commitment to the student, and would allow them to get the most out of the extracurricular they have decided to take.

Another reason that students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities is the many applications that each skill has.

This year, it was found that students who participate in extracurricular activities score, on average, five percent higher on final exams than students who are not involved with any clubs or activities.

This shows that extra-curricular activities have a positive impact in the classroom.

A survey given to over 300 universities showed that colleges are 12 percent more likely to accept someone who participated in school clubs and other extra-curricular activities than someone who didn't.

In addition, there are many life applications to the skills learned in an extra-curricular activity.

For example, someone who takes part in student council learns leadership skills and can apply those to almost any situation. If a student joins the basketball team, they learn how to work as a team to achieve a goal, which is a valuable skill in life. Another example would include someone who joins a robotics team.

Other than learning how to make robots, the students who join robotics club learn how to make a plan to complete a task, problem solve, and handle themselves under pressure at a competition.

Even after learning about all the positive impacts that extra-curricular activities have in their schedule, some students are still concerned they will be unable to fit extra activities in their schedule along with homework, after school jobs, and community service. Clubs run about 45 minutes after each school day, and with the school day ending at 2:15 PM, students would be out of school at 3:00 PM, leaving hours to get home, do homework, and do anything else a student has in their schedule.

One of my friends participated in chess club after school, and got home around 3:30 PM.

He then worked on his homework until 4:45 PM, and worked a job until 7:00 PM.

Even though he had a lot to do after school, he still made time in his schedule to do chess club with his friends, and at the end of the year he said that he really enjoyed participating in a club, and he would do it again next year, and in years ahead.

Extra-curricular activities should be required for students because they allow a student to discover or pursue something they enjoy, learn commitment towards an activity, apply it to many things outside of the club, and still have time to do other things after school. Extra-curricular activities are important, and should be required, because without them, most students wouldn't have anything to look forward to each day.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
64C934615733,"Studies have shown 60% of students are more stressed out then theyll ever be. In my opinion, I think all students shouldn't be required to participate in at least extracurricular activity. I believe this because students have lots of stress already to complete other work, and doing any extracurricular activity even if its just one can add so much more stress.

Millions of students drop out every year, because they cant handle this stress that comes with school. Research has shown more than half of these millions of student were involved in some sort of extracurricular activity. Almost all these student regret it now, but back then it was a savior.

Another reason they shouldn't be required to take be in a extra curricular activity is, because people have families and nobody wants be stuck in a club, or at practice while the rest of their family is eating out. It shouldn't require someone to ask them self if they should go to soccer practice or go to their aunts cookout. Extracurricular activities arent only stressful on the students who participate in them but its also stressful on parents who might have to take their kid to practice or pick their kid's up from school after a club meeting. Most single parents who have work cant even take their kids to practice and have to call a friend to take their kid.

There are millions of reasons why students shouldn't be required to participate in a extracurricular activity. Those are just a few I could think of right now. Thats why I think the rule that all students should be required to participate in a extracurricular should be removed. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
E3FC2388E2A5,"Our principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. This is a really good idea because, there are people who never thought of going to an extracurricular activity. They will really enjoy their time because they chose the best activity for them. In addition, the students will learn new and useful stuff that they never knew before. For an example, if the student decides to work on the yearbook he or she will really enjoy and learn how the yearbook functions.

There are students who never thought of going to an extracurricular activity. The causes can be if they didn't get enough information, peer pressure, and lack of interest or lack examples due to the student not caring enough or searching enough. The principal is helping students to find their best interest.

Most likely the reason students don't know or care because of the lack of information. Due to the principal bringing this new rule, it will cath students' attention and will make them search and realize the different type of extracurricular activities. That way the students will choose the best activity for themselves and get to have a great time. This will ease off the stress from their classes and will release what's on their mind.

In addition, the students learn new and useful stuff they never knew before. An example would be a student working on the yearbook and learning how yearbooks function. They will learn how to take photographs, how to design, edit, and even the students names. This may help them in their future if they ever want to work on a yearbook or something similar.

In conclusion, this will help students learn about extracurricular activites and how they work, finding their best interests and what they can and will like to do, learning new knowledge of their best interestsm, and clearing their minds on their classes. This all will help students to become better individuals.        ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
2908D48CE405,"Most schools have a after school activity system where students may stay after school and do stuff like play sports, talk with teachers, play with friends, etc. These after school clubs are great and are a good way to escape the thought of school and just have fun with friends. Although, after school activities are great, schools should not take advantage over them. Sadly some schools do, and they force all students to do at least on activity. Being forced to do at least one after school activity is awful because some students may not want to go, can cut into free time, and can cause a bad mood throughout the day.

One reason that forcing students to participate in after school activities is awful is that some students just dont want to go. Students don't want to go because they get bored, too tired, or want to be left alone and just breathe. Boredom has a big effect on students attitude, and if they are bored they will end up angry, sad or in a negative mood. Some students may not want to go because they're super tired and need to get home to sleep. Without enough rest these students may be tired throughout the next day which leads to them getting bad grades. Another reason for not wanting to go is if they just want to be left alone and just think about stuff in silence and some people just need to take a brain break for a while so they're able to do their homework or other stuff easily.

Another reason that forcing students to participate in after school activities is awful is that it cuts into free time. Children actually have a life outside of school and play other sports on actual teams or hang out with friends and do other stuff. In result, students will lose that time to do that stuff and will be stuck at school doing something they don't want to do. While they're at school they could be with their family or with their sport teams. Most people have a great relationship with their family and being forced to stay after school which leads to less time at home and that means less time with family. A lot of kids like to play outside or play video games and theres not enough time for them to do what they want because they have to spend the whole night with homework because they get home so late.

The last reason to forcing students to participate in after school activities is awful is that it causes students to have a bad mood throughout the day. Students in the morning may look ahead and remember that they have to stay after school and that little thought can change their mood and make them furious about the rule. If students have a bad mood going into the the after school clubs then they won't try anything new which leads to them not having fun and putting them into a worse mood. When people are in bad moods they tend to get mad easier like when they get in an argument they may overreact.

Being forced to do after school activities is awful because of all those reasons and makes no sense. Schools that force their students to do after school activities should stop forcing it upon their students and make it optional. With all the reasons can cause one giant problem that leads to being bored more often, less rest and sleep, worse grades, and being a more negative person. With that comes consequences like less confidence and more negative stuff.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
9F3C7383FFA4,"What are the benefits of extracurricular activities? The principal decided to make all of the students to participate in an extracurricular class. I agree with the principal, I think that if all the students participate in that activity, they will get to socialize and learn how to be more collaborative with others.

Most students enjoy socializing but, if we have an extracurricular class, the students will have an increased amount of time to socialize with their friends. I like socializing with my friends but, during classes there is only a small amount of time to talk to each other. I think the extracurricular activity will give all the students more time to talk and chat. Socializing is a very important thing to do in life, it could make someone's day or even inspire someone just by talking to them. Some students might even get rid of stress by socializing. The extra class will make students be able to achieve these beneficial things, and they will have less stress than usual. I also think that when students socialize with their friends, they not only talk, but they learn something. I learned tons of things from my friends, they showed me how to solve some math problems and they told me what books are fun and is good to read. The extracurricular class can change tremendous amounts of things that are very beneficial to the students.

The extra activity can make students socialize more, but they can also make them be more collaborative. Collaborating is really important to the students, students will have to collaborate and work together even as adults. I think that if the students collaborate with other students there would be no problem collaborating when they are an adult. When students become adults, they will have to collaborate with others, and that's why the extra class is important. Some examples of collaborating is listening to other people's opinions, talking about what I think, and working together to finish a task. Some students might not like to work with other people, but they will have to in the future, so, I think that they should start to practice collaborating in the extracurricular class. I like collaborating with others, I listen to other people's opinions, I think about their opinions, and I tell them about my opinion. The extra activity will be a great place to collaborate. Collaborating can also make students respect others, when they listen to their fellow classmates or teammates, and not argue about other's decisions, that is an example of respecting others. If students learn how to respect others, other students and teachers will think good about that person, and I think that the extracurricular activity is a great impact to the students.

In my opinion, if all of the students participate in this activity, they will be able to achieve many things. There are many more tremendous things that will benefit the students, and there are still many things for a student to learn. The extracurricular activity will teach the students much more things that are needed in life as an adult.      ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
963D4834165D,"Dear, Dr. Generic_Name

I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity and heres why. I think that students should participate in a extracurricular activity because some students might not like the idea about doing a activity, However if they try it out maybe they will like it and will be interested about it. I also think that if some students try an activity such as sports, working on the yearbook, or serve on the student council, it will help them come out of there comfront zone.

First I agree on your decision because some students wouldn't like the idea about doing an activity for school, However if the students tries out an activity than maybe they will be interested in it and will carry on with it and make it a carrer in the future. Me as a student I want to play sports. Sports interest me and if I play sports I belive that it can take me a long way.

My last reason on why I agree about your decision is because certain students in our school are shy. Students that are shy can do certain activies that will help them come out of their comfront zone. I think it will help them get over their shyness.

So Dr. Generic_Name, the decision about making all students participate in at least one activity is a great idea. I relized that the activites I can do in school can help me take my carrer far as I can go. It also can help other students figure out what they want to do in the future. Shy students can come out their comfront zone by doing certain activites that will help them overcome their shyness. Dr Generic_Name this was a great decision you made.

8B74BC1E0166,"The Principal has decided that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Such as, participating in sports, helping with the yearbook, or serving on the student council. Maybe, this could cause students to stress out more, and add more problems to their sad, miserable lives- Or maybe, this could be a benefit to students. Giving them more time to socialize, and a chance to exercise. That's why I'm agreeing to the Principal's decision. Most students may disagree, but I think that this could give students even more of an opportunity to thrive in different hobbies, and possibly improve grades.

These extra activities give students more time at school to finish up work, (mostly depending on what activity they chose to participate in) and spend more time with friends. Most kids probably turn down these activities either because they just want to go home, or they see these activities as too much work. I think that if they participate in at least one that maybe it could open their eyes to a new hobby, or they might make use the extra time they have at school to finish up some work that they might've forgotten to do (therefore, improving grades). Might even get some kids to go to bed earlier, because of how tired they might be once they get home (once again depending on what activities they decide to participate in).

The activities don't even need to be physically active, as listed in the examples of activities the Principal listed; students can work on the year book, which sounds to me like a bunch of printing and drawing (and dedication). Then of course, some people might thrive in the sports category and/or have friends they know that participate in sport activities. What I'm saying here is that they have plenty of activities to choose from, and most likely can find an activity they will enjoy. Plus, having all students participating in some kind of extra activity could either improve one's physical health, or give them a little extra something productive to do.

In conclusion, extra activities could open students eyes to something new, something they wouldn't have done if they just went on with their day without the extracurricular activities. They could pick up new hobbies, or get better at a hobby they've had. Students also have plenty of activities to choose from so, not only are they participating in the activities, but they can participate in an activity that they can enjoy. These activities give students more time to socialize, finish up work, and maybe even improve their sleeping patterns (that's kind of a stretch but maybe).

Those are my reasons as to why I agree with the Principal's decision of making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
C8080378BD24,"Extracurricular activities are enjoyable and can help you in so many ways!

They can help you in school, at home, and can maybe help better yourself as person. I agree that all students should participate in extracurricular activities because they can be fun and very enjoyable.

Extracurricular activities can help you in school and help you become a harder working student.

Extracurricular activities could help with students ability to focus and understand better. Students level of focus could go up meaning that you would pay more attention to all your classes and help get your bad grades up to more acceptable and better grades. They can also help with some students attitudes in class or towards school and classwork. Some students may have a personality change for the better which could lead them to have a better outlook on school and classwork. Extracurricular activities can also help your grades! Many students have bad grades because they can't focus or think the work is too complicated or hard, which isn't the case, by being in any extracurricular activity your whole brain might do a flip and you could begin to understand and work towards getting those A's and B's.

Extracurricular activities may benefit you in school by giving you better focusing abilities, giving them a better, more positive, attitude about school and classwork, and can even bring their grades up by a lot because they have more enthusiasm and a much better ability to focus than they did before!

Extracurricular activities may also benefit students mental health!

Studies have shown that students enrolled in extracurricular activities have a better self image, Self image can change in a positive way because your peers or adults around you are complimenting your hard work. It may also affect their day to day mood. Their moods might not be feeling sad and empty in the morning or feeling lonely and depressed all day, they can change to being happy and hyper in the morning and having a positive attitude all day long! It can also make students happier because they have something to look forward to. Student surveys around the world say that when you have something to look forward to can bring up your happiness almost half way!

Extracurricular activities can benefit their mental health by bettering your self image,having more enjoyable and positive moods all day, to being excited to have something to look forward to which is always a big help.

Although, some students may experience the complete opposite of these results!

Some may find themselves having more work and less time to spend doing some of the things they love. It is sometimes hard for young people to balance out a good amount of time to study and do homework with a good amount of time to sleep or hang out with friends or family. Their grades could start to suffer more because of the amount of stress they may begin to have.

Still, these hardships could be a learning experience for students and could even help them become a better person and a hard working citizen as they grow into adults. Everyone faces hard times in their lives, these may seem like the end of the world to students but really, it is just the universes way of teaching them of many more hardships they will come across in life, the universe may be trying to teach them how to deal with things like this and advising them to never give up..

Even though students may experience feelings of too much stress or depression, it's important to help them if they feel this way and get them on the path to getting better grades and certainly a much better mental health! They may even learn from these experiences as well!

Extracurricular activities are very fun and have great effects on students ranging from getting a better, more clear, self image and mental state, to getting better grades in school and being able to focus for longer periods of time, and who knows, students may even learn a thing or two along the way about life and what becoming a good, hardworking citizen is. They could even get a taste of what adulthood is like!",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
80270A6CC6EF,"Extra curricular activities can help a student improve not only in skills that the activity teaches but also socially. If my principal told everyone that they would have to participate in an extracurricular activity kids from my school would not like it at first, then they would see that it is not so bad. It would force some students to try something new and get out of their comfort zone. If a student already participates in activities then they can improve in that activity. For some students if not forced they will not interact with others. If the school gives them a nudge in the right direction it would be a huge help. All kids should be required to participate in extra curricular's because they can improve on their preexisting skills, get new experiences, and form a stronger community.

If a student already plays a sport then they can use this opportunity to learn new skills. There are many different techniques and a student may have only been exposed to one. If a team understands the strategies of another team then their defense will improve. They can also learn new moves to improve their offense. All aspects of a players game could improve by learning from others so why not learn from your classmates. If a student does not play sports but is interested in helping put the yearbook together then they can improve their communication skills. Then use those new skills to help their group to communicate about their project and make it easier. Joining an extracurricular activity will improve any skills that are needed in the club that a student is joining.

Students can get new experiences from being required to join a club and they might even find an activity that they really enjoy. A student might not have had time to try an activity or they might have been to scared to. A student may not have ever tried playing volleyball before because they were playing other sports or were involved with other organizations. With this rule implemented the student could try playing volleyball and hate the sport or they could end up loving it and it could become their favorite. Requiring students to participate in extra curricular activities gives students a perfect opportunity to try out activities they have always wanted to try.

When a lot of a schools students know each other it will create a stronger community. When people with the same interests hang out together they usually form some sort of friendship. A strong community will only positively impact a school. It will result in less bullying, less harassment, and better friendships between the students. Everyone will have a couple of friends to sit with at lunch from their activity so no one will sit alone at lunch and everyone will have someone to say ""hi"" to in the hallways. A school with required activities will form a stronger community and therefor a stronger school in general.

It should be a requirement for students to be involved in extra curricular activities, they can form a stronger community, try new activities, and expand their skill set. If the principal makes a rule that all students have to participate in after school activities then students will have an opportunity to get better at things they have already tried and enjoyed or learn how to participate in a completely new activity. Not only is a person learning new skills but also making new friends and creating a stronger community within the school. It is important for students to have a group of friends and having mandatory extra curricular's would make it easier to find that group. Overall having mandatory extracurricular activities would make the school a stronger and more enjoyable place to be for the students.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
855FF8C43FAE,"Are students up for the challenge of making a yearbook? I think everybody should participate in designing a yearbook. Making a yearbook could help the teachers out a lot, it could take less time to make it if everybody helped, and it'll make a yearbook full of everybody's ideas.

Making a yearbook would help the teachers out a lot because i see teachers trying to take pictures of us to put in the yearbook and i think it would be fun if we did it! Teachers already go through enough in their day and they dont have a lot of time to just sit down and create a yearbook. I feel like we could take a stand and help out for once. The students and I need things to do, some kids have nothing to do. A group of us would take pictures around the school and the others would help create the yearbook after school. The teachers need a break from us and planning sometimes.

All of us working together will accomplish a lot. There are hundreds of us at this school and we are a smart group of people if we try hard. There are a lot of pages in a year book and it'll take days to finish but we got this! My grandma told me yesterday ""hard work pays off."" It's just like Field Hockey, its a group effort. We all need to work together as a team.

Every person in this school is different in their own way. If you take a very imaginary girls idea, or a very bold guys idea, and even just a chill persons idea; it'll all come together and make a beautiful yearbook! We could take our own pictures from our camera rolls at the school and put pictures in there, we would put paint in it to make it colorful, and we could take people's pictures for the yearbook. I'm a very creative person, i'm in art pause and designing things are fun to me! It could also get people to branch out and meet new people.

My mom said to me ""you should help the school by doing something"", i never thought about making a yearbook but it seems like it would be fun! We could be helping the teachers out, we would take less time as a group, and all of our ideas would be put into it.

However, the greatest decision he has made, is making sure that every single student is participating in an extracurricular activity. Because our amazing principal made this incredible thing, and because your participating in these extracurricular activities now, you improve your physical, mental, and emotional health, develop and improve these creative passions and skills, and it overall really benefits you and our school.

All extracurricular activities at our school are unique and give you physical, mental, and emotional benefits. Plus there just overall really, really fun and exiting! Sports mainly improve you physically, but they also improve you mentally and emotionally. The hard work that is required for sports helps you get stronger and keeps you staying active. But afterwards, the exhaustion makes you sleep better so when you wake up, you have more energy, which makes you feel stronger, more attentive, and in an overall positive mood! Plus, if your more attentive, you'll get better grades and performance during school. But sports are not for everybody. You could sign up for a musical extracurricular activity instead! Like sports, music also helps you in many ways! You can become inclined and talented in music! You can also make new friends as you make cool, unique, and creative music! There are tons of options to if you don't like one specific instrument or type of music. However though, if you don't like sports or music, you can still participate in clubs! Clubs are a whole different level compared to sports and music, because there are almost too many options! There's writing, drama, art, reading, debate, sports, health, and so much more! Each club changes and improves you in different ways. In debate, you can learn how to become more persuasive someone better. In art, you can calm down and unwind as you create a masterpiece. Plus, if you can't find the right club for you, you can make your own! All of these amazing extracurricular activities wouldn't be here if our principal decided to not to make all of these activities just for us!

Because your doing these extracurricular activities, you learn all of these creative, innovative, and unique skills, traits, and passions. You can learn how to properly use, play, and take care of an instrument, or you can become extremely creative in the art club. You could become the next professional basketball player by joining the basketball team. Not only can you could find out your really good at something by doing one of these many extracurricular activities, but you can also become better at something. You could improve your sportsmanship by playing a soccer game against a really competitive team thats a little mean about winning. But you could also be faster at typing on the computer because you have been playing an extremely fast paced song on your violin. If you were in the reading club, you could improve how fast you read. There are many skills, traits, and passions you can improve or develop by dong these extracurricular activities.

By doing these activities, your actually helping our school as well as you. The football team could have a huge game at our school and as the crowed of your school cheers, you could be the one to get the winning touchdown. Your friends and family could be sitting with the rest of our school in awe as they silently watch you in amazement in their eyes as you do a perfect solo on your saxophone during an extremely important concert in fron of the entire school. You could be telling your class about some really cool facts you learned in one of your clubs when your class comes across that subject. In the long run, these activities that our fantastic principal made for us, really have an impact on you and our school.

Overall, from these activities being good for us and developing or improving your passions, skills, and traits, to benefiting you and our school, these extracurricular activities that our principal made for us, really affects us all. Thats why we need to have everyone pitch in and join one of our many activities. This is why it's a good thing that our principal is making sure that we are all participating.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
EDD3DA14F057,"Have you ever done extracurricular activities after school? Well in my school our principle makes all the students do extracurricular activities including sports,working on the year book ,and serving in the student council. I agree with this new rule because of these two reasons. It makes you more healthy when you join sports, and It helps you socialize more, also you can make new friends.

As I was saying doing extracurricular activities can make you healthy. It makes you healthy by just running around and exercising. It also makes you healthy by you just having fun. If your sad playing sports can make you happy and something to look forward to at the end of the day. and my final reason on why extracurricular activities after school makes you healthy is you have something to do after school; instead of being bored at your house you can run around and play with others. and that brings me to my next point.

my second point of why extracurricular activities after school is good for you is you get to socialize more. This is good because Its good to talk to others. Another thing thats good about socializing is it helps keep you out of trouble. for example when you are talking to your friends then that means you are ignoring the bad stuff theirs going on around you. finally My final reason on why socializing is good for you is that it makes you earn friends. Having fun and socializing with someone is a good thing and with extracurricular activities after school you can easily make friends.

In conclusion extracurricular activities after school is a good thing because you get to stay healthy and meet new and fun people. I really think people should do extracurricular activities after school because you will have fun and it will not hurt to try some things that interest you.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
AA45F6AB9AA9,"A extracurricular is something you do out of school or maybe it's for a team in school but is something to get you to socialize , meet new friends,being active ,finding something you actually love to do and keeping you entertained

But for some people they do see it in that way and may feel like that is a way to get people out of there comfort zone . That's why if my principal decided to make me do an extracurricular activity I would disagree because some people are too busy and could cause stress, or they don't want to do an activity at school or they already are doing an activity or they not a very social person and thats why I would disagree.

One reason I would disagree is because some people are just way to busy and if principle makes them do an extracurricular activity that might cause stress to them and that could be adding more to their schedule which would be a struggle to maintain all of work I may have to do already especially as child . For example is someone has an activity out of school like dance on Monday and the principle makes them do another activity on that day it would be hard for them to stay after for that activity if she have another place to go already , and that's why that would be adding more to there schedule and would be hard to maintain another example is maybe I have a lot of school work I have to do or I have to study for a test and you don't have time to stay after for an activity that could also cause stress .Thats one reason why I disagree to making people do an extracurricular activity .

another reason I disagree is because some people aren't interested in what the school offers and if the principle makes them do something they don't want to do that would make them feel like they are forced to pick out of options they don't like . Say for example my school only offers basketball ,track and cheer leading ,but I really want to do soft ball that could be forcing me too do a sport I would not like to do . For another example say your school offers languages for and extracurricular activity like french and Spanish but he/she wanted to learn another language that would be be hard for me because maybe I only wanted learn language. That's another reason why I do disagree with making people do extracurricular activities.

The last reason I disagree with making people do extracurricular activities is because maybe i'm he/she is not a very social person and they do not like to meet new people and they are very shy it could make people uncomfortable and nervous .For example he/she is made to join an activity and they feel left out because everyone else has friends and are talking too people they make them feel bad because they are not a social person. Another example is say that may not be a very athletic person and thy have to participate in a sport that could also make them feel like they are forced to do something they would not like to do and make them feel uncomfortable as well ,and thats why I disagree with making people do extracurricular activity .

In conclusion that why if my principle made me do an extracurricular activity I would disagree because he/she might not want to anything in school or he/she are to busy or they not really social people ,and making people do extracurricular activity could cause stress, and more to there schedule and making people feel uncomfortable .That's why strongly disagree with making people do extracurricular activities ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
7F2AF2E21E2B,"Are activities good or bad for you?

I am writing today about why I think that we should have extracurricular activities and why it is important to have this decisions and why it is god for you.

I agree with the decision that you should have at least one extracurricular activity because If you take the activity's like sports, band, yearbook or another activity's then you can find out what you like and do not like. It is good for you to find out what you like so you can have practice and find out you really like it. If you take a activity like sports, band, yearbook or another activity then you can find out what you like and do not like. I think that if students take a extracurricular activity then get to try new things that they have probably have not tried before. If students participate in activities they will get to meet more people that like the same things.

Students that do an extracurricular activity can be themselves and express who they are and who they what to be. If the students participate in the decision then they could help their future and find out what they want to do when they grow up. I think that if the students follow this decision they will have fun and do better in school and have more time do. what hey want to do

I predict that if students do a activity in school they will want to try more of the activities. This is a good and the students should like it that they get to have the extracurricular activities.

In conclusion I agree with this decision you should have activities to participate in,

It is good for students to try new things that they have not tried before.  ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
29CAF243AA8C,"I agree with this because, you can spend more time at school, this can be helpful, and this can be successful.

I agree because, you get more time at school. You get to see your friends more. If you see your friends more you get to hangout with them longer. You get to see your teachers more. If you see your teachers more you can get more help. You can bring your grades up. If you bring your grades up you can be successful. This is why I agree to get more time at school.

I agree because, it can be successful. You can get help from teachers. If your grades are low and you want to get them up you can talk to your teachers. You can help other students. If you help other students that can make them successful. You can help teachers. If you help teachers that can make them be more successful. This is why I agree on this being successful.

I agree on this being helpful. You can have an activity thats about technology. This can help in the future because if something is wrong in your house you can fix it. You can have a cooking activity. This can help because if your mom is not at home yet then you can help her make dinner. You might be in a sports activity. This can help for the future because if you want to teach sports you can teach it to little kids. This is why I agree on this being helpful. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
C1F52F0473A1,"The principal has decided that seven hours of school isn't enough. Now he is making everyone do at least one extracurricular activity every week. The students aren't given a choice, they are being forced to use their own time, not during the school day, to participate in an activity they may not want to do. Students should be able to choose what they want to spend their free time doing. It can be damaging to students if they are not able to choose how they want to spend their afternoons after a long, hard school day. This plan can cause many negative effects on students like getting less sleep, worse grades, and many other negative consequences.

With the principles approach, students will have less time to complete their assignments. Going to an activity will take time that can be used for things like completing homework away from the students. They will have less time to complete their homework, which means they most likely will stay up later than normal and get less sleep. This can cause the student to focus less and do worse in school, and can also affect their mental health A more reasonable approach would be to promote participating in extracurricular activities. That way, more students will join, but it will be their choice. It is not fair that this valuable time is being taken away from them.

The principle's approach may sound positive at first, but looking into it shows it can be very unhealthy for students. I feel that us students are being violated, and that we should be given the choice to join activities or not. The principle's plan will most likely backfire and cause students to do worse in school. People will eventually realize that his decision is absurd.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
93B11461B925,"Do you think this should be done? I think that the principal should make students participate in an activity because it will give students something to do and it gives you a break from stressful things. It also helps you get some physical activity and keeps you healthy.

I think if the principle made this choice it would be great. Some people go home after school and just play video games and sit inside. If this choice was made people would be doing something and not being lazy all day. When I come home from school everyday I am so bored and have nothing to do. If I had to participate in something it would give me something to do after school.

Also I think if the principle made choice then it would give you a break from stressful things. Every day I come home from school and have nothing to do. So my mind starts making me think about my grades. It also makes me think about college. Those are two things that stress me out. I am worried that if my grades are not high enough I won't be able to get into a good college. So if I had something to do after school everyday it would take my mind off things.

For the last thing it helps with physical activity. If you are at home and have nothing to do it sucks. So if you go do a sport it will make you more fit and healthy. When I was in 4th grade I was a really big kid then I got into sports and started lifting weights. I am still a big kid but I have lost weight and gained lots of strength which has made me more confident.

Those are the reasons why I think that we should be made to do at least one thing. It would help with lots more and make life easier in the long run. I think other people would disagree because they don't wanna be forced to do something but life isnt always your choice.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
96CC30CFE49E,"Participating in something specific like say, sports or student council can help you in many ways. 80% of students have said that they would rather participate in activities that are outside of school, than school activities. 20% of the remaining students said they'd rather do school activities than non-school related activities. Why? Most of the students in the 20% said: ""It's free, it helps you do better, and you know people more."". In my opinion forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities even though it sounds cruel, is actually really helpful! My three reasons as to why are, students can make new friends and recognize teachers whom they've never known before, it can allow them to try harder in school and reach for a higher goal, and in many cases it can help them be able to find out new things and explore something else!

Forcing students to participate in extra curricular activities, helps students make more friends and know more teachers. I say this because say in sports you have to have a team right, and together you win, travel, and do other things. Also you have to plan, so there includes talking and you get to know everyone there. Having new friends would probably mean that you can be able to reach for another goal.

Doing extracurricular activities can help you want to do better in school because you have a new occupation and maybe you like the new activity you're doing but it requires you to have good grades. So you'll want to have good grades in order to continue doing that activity you like.

Extracurricular activities can help them find out what they like and what they dont like or they re not specifically good at. This way they know what does not challenge them and what is a challenge for them. Sports is a good example because of running, jumping and putting yourself at the limit. Some people can run, some people can't run. Some people can jump some people can't jump.

Being forced to do activities is not fun. But not all the times is everything bad. Some people might enjoy activities, some might not. But remember, don't judge a book by its cover.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
8BFF78A27A8B,"Think of all the times your child has come home from school bored out of thier mind. With nothing else to do, they sit down on the couch and waste hours away on their phone, but still feel unsatisfied. Because of our principal, students will spend less time on their phones and more time in the real world. Requiring these extracurriculars will help students make new friends, develop new interests, and fill up time that would otherwise be used on technology.

When students sign up for an extracrricular that they are interested in, they will meet new people that share the same interest as them, and can form friendships from that. Since these students will be spending time together out of school, they can easily persue these friendships and help them grow. This also gives them the opportunity for more social time, which school does not allow much of. Because these students are with others that are similar to them, they have time to talk with people who enjoy the same types of activities and maybe even more. Without this shared interest in their sports team or club, they may never have met during their school years. Extracurriculars can help connect different kinds of people and make lasting friendships.

If a student signs up for an activity that they are interested in but have never had the chance to learn about, this will help them develop different interests and explore them. Our activities include student body government positions, sports, and creative art programs such as the yearbook club. These kinds of clubs help students find new hobbies and interests which they can apply themselves to. New interests help students strive to work harder to learn more and perform better, and these extracurriculars are giving all of the students in our school that opportunity. Many people in this school may not put themselves out there on their own, but with help from our principal they will realize how it can be fun to work together with others in interesting activities.

Finally, the required extracurriculars help keep students from being on their phones everyday. Children in their teens spend too much time on technology, and are becoming obssesed. It is the digital age, but it is not healthy for them to be on their phones all the time. With other fun activities outside of school, they can actually interact with ther friends rather than watching YouTube or texting them. Face to face interactons are good for teens, and they do not spend enough time talking to their friends in real life. Activities with their friends can help them get outside and run around while spending time with people, or use their minds to create fun art while having a good time. Being away from technology is the best way to become a happier person, and teens need to learn that to help them with the rest of their life. These extracurriculars will make the students' middle school years more successful, but more importantly it will make their overall experience better.

Activities outside of school are a good opportunity for students, because of the many benefits to them. These extracurriculars help them make new friends and have social time with them, develop new interests, and fill up time that would be used on their phones otherwise. Some may say that that these required activities are forcing teens to do things that they do not want to do, but because of the wide range of clubs and sports offered, there is an activity for everyone. This program set up by our principal is only helping the students participate more in their school and use all of the wonderful activities to their advantage. They have so many wonerful programs here at our school, and this just helps students really discover how great they are through participation. So when your child is signing up for a sports team, art club, or an achedemic club, remember that this is an opportunity for your student to learn and grow. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
41CC238F5738,"Why Students Should Not Be Forced To Take An Extracurricular Activity.

So picture you're at home, burdened with homework, rushing to get it all done and all of a sudden, your parent gets an email from the school saying that every student will have to take one extracurricular activity. Your parents are worried because extracurricular activities are expensive, how you'll get to and from that activity, and your school work. How fair is that? It puts stress on you and your family. Don't get me wrong, extracurricular activities are great for growing teenagers, it can be a great safe space for them, but why should they be forced to take one?

They Are Really Expensive

Some popular activities are dance, martial arts, sports, and music. Which are all VERY expensive. They are great extracurricular activities to do, but so expensive, and not all parents can afford them. For dance, costumes are at least $100, dance shoes vary on quality, but are usually expensive, dance wear is about $30-$50 per piece, and makeup, lots and lots of makeup. Plus, you usually have to know how to sew, and if you don't already, you might have to add the expense of sewing classes in there. See how they all add up? That's about $230 for just costumes, dance wear and shoes. Let's say your parent is a teacher, the average teacher makes $65,000 per year which isn't that much. Some even make $35,000 per year, even less. And to have school expenses, plus that, that's a huge chunk of your parent's paycheck. Some parents have to use that money to pay rent or mortgage, heating bills, water bills, electricity bills, and extra things like clothes, and food. That doesn't give them that much of a flexible amount to spend. Some kids prefer to save their parent's money, plus if they dont want to take one, that's even more unfair.

They Won't Be Committed To It

Let's say the options the school provides are all not of interest to them, so they're forced to take something they don't want to do. How would you like to be forced to commit to something you didn't want to do to start with? I'm pretty sure no one would want that. Though extracurricular activities are great for students to do, some are just reserved and are shy when having to do things in front of people. For students with anxiety, that is extremely embarrassing. Plus, if you force someone to do something they don't want to do, they'll just do it with half-effort and that makes everything one step harder for the people who actually wanted to do that activity. I can almost guarantee that this will happen if schools force students to do this, and it'll just make the activities less fun for the ones who actually want to do it.

They May Have Other Things To Do

So as we all know, in middle school, there's a lot of homework, even more so in high school. A lesson is usually about an hour and a half long. School ends at 3:30, so they'd get home at 5:00. 5 or 6 is the most common dinner time, and it usually lasts about 30 minutes. That's 5:30. Then, they have to go and try to finish their homework. If they have a lot of it, it can take a long time, and can usually lead to them putting off important stuff, like personal hygiene (GROSS!). They're probably super exhausted from their activity, and just want to take a shower. But nope, they have to do the rest of their homework. Depending on how much they have, they could end up staying up really late. Highschoolers can usually end up staying up until 3 am in the morning doing homework. That makes them more tired and not ready to focus the next day. It could've saved them so much more if they didn't have to do the activity.

So how much is forcing students to do an extracurricular activity really saving them? I feel like if schools force students to do an extracurricular activity, they will see lower test grades, lower participation rates, much more attitudes towards them, and more tardiness. This behavioral change will be because of the time wasted on things they don't want to do, and less sleeping hours. Though extracurricular activities are great for them, dont force them on people, because instead of helping, it's actually hurting. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
37D40E1CD549,"Did you know that extracurricular activities can help you in many ways? I think that extracurricular activities should be prioritized more. For example, schools should help kids out by having them do extracurricular activities like a sports team. I agree that my principal should require every student to participate in an extracurricular activity so their brain can get stronger, they can have some physical fitness, and so they can have a safe place to go after school.

First, an after school activity could help students build their brain power and help it get stronger. In a extracurricular activity like chess club, the students could build their brain. In the chess club, students learn strategy and technique which are good life skills and helps build their brain. The brain requires strategy so it can do anything in the best way possible or the quickest way. Technique is also important to the brain so it can do things efficiently uniquely.

Also, certain extracurricular activities could help students get more in shape and help them learn fitness skills. For example, an after school weight lifting class teaches the kids good technique and how to get in shape. All students need good technique when lifting weights because otherwise they could get seriously injured. These type of classes also teach kids how to get in shape or stay in shape so they can live a healthy and happy life.

Finally, after school activities help kids have a few extra hours out of their toxic home or their stressful personal life. Some students come home every day wishing they could go back to school. These students come home to abusive parents or just siblings who act like bullies. For them in a extracurricular activity they could escape that and create family like relationships with their teammates or piers. The coach of the sports team also can act like a guardian type figure if their parents are never around or just don't care for them.

In conclusion, I strongly agree that the principal should require that all students should participate in one or more after school activities. These activities help every kid and every kid can find something helpful in a extracurricular activity. The kids who participate will live better and stronger lives.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
4838F967821D,"Do you think all student should perticipate in at least one afther school activity? I donÃÂ´t know about you but, I do. I agree with the principal because, they need the experince for the future, they need a chance to see the world, and finally, they have to make friends and meet new people.

First, I know they need the experince for the future because, if they don what are they going to do when they want to play a sport but donÃÂ´t know how to play that sport. What are they going to do when there trying to get a job but donÃÂ´t know how to do that job. If they had takin the that chance to learn about that job or sport in school they would have no problem getting that job. Most people on the street have missed there chance and look at them now. Thats why they need the experince for the future. I donÃÂ´t want to see none of my friends on the corner cause they missed their chance.

Next, they need a chance to see the world because, they need to explore. They need to see and find new things. Do you know what happens to a kidÃÂ´s mindset when they learn, see, feel, taste, and hear new things. There mindset will change in a very good way. It will expand there mindset and It will not only expand there mindset but them too. When you talk to this person again he or she will seem like a whole diffrent person. He or she will become more mature. That is what seeing and exploring the world will do to a kid. That is why they need that chance.

Finally, they need to meet new people and make friends because, a person is nothing without friends. Having friends is like a ticket to the future. Having friends is like a whole new aventure just wating for you yo come. I think It was my grandfather said to me before,ÃÂ¨ that without friends you are nothing, without friends you will be nothing, without friends you will have nothing.ÃÂ¨ Do you belive what my grandfather said? I do and I will never stop beliving that saying.

These are my reasons why I agree that all students should perticipate in at least one afther school activity. These will always be my reasons why students need to have the experince, why they need to explore the world, and why they need to make friends. I think you should agree too. The principal is right.       ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
85ACDB1C7BE4,"Have you ever done something you never thought you would do? In fact I actually have. I participated in a activity I didn't think I was good at. I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity like playing sports, work on the yearbook, and join the student counsel. These are activities that students would probably be interested in if they just participated. Reasons being that they would be more active, they could figure out a new hobby, and they could meet new people.

My first reason why I agree with this decision is because student would be more active. Some students now just like to stay home and be on their phone all day or watch television. I think that it isnt healthy because they arent keeping themselves active by just staying home all day. For example I used to stay home all day everyday, but now I play on a soccer team and it keeps me healthy, active, and happy. I enjoy what I do, and I think that students should be able to have that same feeling. It dosen't have to be a sport that they play, but it can at least be something to keep them active and entertained.

My second reason is because students would be able to discover new hobbies. They could discover new things like playing sports, joining student council, and even working on the yearbook. There are many activities to choose from and students just have to get out of their comfort zone and figure out what best fits them. For example when I first started playing soccer I didn't think it was going to be fun for me, but then I started getting more into it and then I realized it was now a hobby for me since I liked it so much. And now I love going to the field with my dad whenever I don't have practice.

My last reason is students would be able to meet new people. Meeting new people can either go good or bad. At first glance a person may look very nice, but then they turn out being mean or disrespectful. Or you could look at someone that looks mean, but then you realize they are the sweetest person. For example when I went to a new school I didn't know much people, and I looked over at this girl that had a face that made her look mean. I was nervous to go talk to her because I thought she was going to be rude, but turned out she is like a best friend and the nicest person I've ever met. Thats why students shouldn't assume about a person based on looks because they are not always right. But definitely participating in different activities will give students the chance to meet new people.

To come to a conclusion, I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. My reasons being they would be more active, meet new people, and be able to find a new hobby. I hope that students become more interested in this decision.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

in my personal opinion we should always have a choice on what to do like if we want a tattoo or if we want to quit school the decision should always be up to us no matter what anybody says it is our life we shape our own path to destiny, and we may need the help of others on the way and that is just fine okay because everybody needs help in life even i do with somethings like i need help with my math, and i need help with my science because math and science confuse me now because math involves letters now and science i never really got but most people get everything about these 2 subjects but not me, and that is why i ask for help because we all need it like some people need help with sleeping or getting up, it is an odd process to me but to be honest but we need to have our own choices and our own say in the matter that everyone should hear and then voice their opinion, that is what we need to do now we could put it up to a vote but I'm absolutely certain that everyone will vote no to being forced to do extracurricular activities because, nobody wants to and if the principal does not agree they can suck it up because they got outvoted and that means the people have spoken that is what the majority of the students have voted on because, it is their right to make their own decisions and do what they want to do and everyone should respect that in my opinion and if they do not then say i do not care it is my opinion not yours and thats that and they can not say no to everybody's opinion, they might say it to 5 or 10 people but not all of the people and thats the beauty of the world because this is how the voting system works and it is a great system that we should not change it at all it has gotten us a lot of good presidents and a lot of great senators but the voting system got us my favorite president john f Kennedy, he was one of the best presidents for like 2 years then he got assassinated that was a pretty sad day i felt bad for his wife, but still the voting system is almost flawless so we should keep improving it and not get rid of it because i think getting rid of it a long time ago would have been crazy and we would have not ended up with the type of system we are stuck with today.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

Also if the student doesn't like the activities what are they going to do there just going to be there doing nothing and not join. Also what if the student has stuff to do and that gets in the way of their time and they need to do homework and they have less time at home to do there homework. Also activity can be annoying and you can start to dislike going to clubs.

Another thing is that if the activities they pick and they get the one the didn't want that would suck because you have to do a club you didn't in the first places. Also if they have to do a club it might be a lot of time for them and less time of not doing homework and it can be a pain for them because they might have to stay up late and finish their homework. another reason is if the students are going to be very tied and that might not help them.

Also another reason is that it may intimated the meeting new people that can scare them because they are society award and so those types of thing can make them feel nervous. Also it just and that can make someone nervous introducing them to new people. Also if someone forces someone to do something the student is not going to want to do it. Another thing is that students are like there free time and a club would just take the free time down and the students don't like that one bi.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
F0C2837665BF,"I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity a year. If a student partakes in one extracurricular activity a year it might make students want to come to school or make them want to learn more.

For example if a student participates in the student council they would learn more about leadership,independence and authority which would also make those people better members of society if they had ever been a part of the student council.

Another reason I agree with the rule is because if a student was a part of working on the yearbook it would help students be organized,work with others and be more involved with the school and teachers and all the students as well and the people that participated in making the yearbook might use the skills they learned in that activity in there profession when they get older.

My last reason sports,sports are a extracurricular activity and most people would choose this as there one activity I know I would but if people choose sports there are so many choices such as football,baseball,soccer,track,etc. students will learn teamwork and how to be competitive and any and every one can play a sport its fun and it is healthy keeps you fit and can also be a way to be happy if your feeling down.

All of this is why I agree with the principal on making it so every student has to participate in at least one extracurricular activity for reasons of learning being healthy and being a over all a better member of society. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
7E7C67A0DC16,"I agree with the principal, because students should try new things so every student in school do an extracurriculam like sports,working on the yearbook or being a student council. I say playing sports would be fun you can exercise and you also get motivated to play for a team of any sports,if you work on the yearbook you could be able to know who people are and it might be fun to help on the yearbook. Being a student council would be interesting, because you get to help other teens that has problems and what they need so then they could trust you and then you could be able to know what there intentions are of some sort. I think that it was a good idea for teens to do extracurriculam. Teens can turn that into a hobby so they can do while they're bored doing nothing. In my opinion,I think if students try new things they might like it because they would not know what they like to do best but in the future. I think the teens could have a similar careers in the future they could grow up to be a soccer player,basketball player or they could be a tennnis player in any other sports they could be one famouse player. If students work on yearbooks and planning how they are going to sell it and what the covers look. The teens would work to be a person who plans book and how they are published and could be an illistrator. People who makes book and sells it get a lot of money,teens who also want to do student councile will be amazing because when they grow up to be a councilor of some sort. they also could be a therapist who helps people that are traumitized or horrified or have problems of what is happening in there lifes. Thatis the reason why I agree with the principal, to make every student do an extracarriculam activty so they could get motivated so they could be what they want to when they grow up. Teens and kids are the future of life and I say that the teachers and principal wants the best out of us like are parents wants us to be very succesful in the future and be happy about it.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
A54A8A6E1AB8,"Why Doing an Extracurricular Activities Should Be Required

Middle school can be really hard you might be staying up to late after you finish your homework, or your having friendship problems, or maybe your just a little lost in your middle school career and you need guidance. There's one obvious solution, extracurricular activities! I think its amazing that councilors, administrators, and principles are making after school activities required in school. Activities are a crucial part of our middle school experience and even if its not required I believe that people should still do clubs and sports. Extracurricular activities helps people, like new students make friends, helps make people feel like they are apart of a team and have a team bond, and activities help our mental health as well.

One of the biggest reasons people join clubs is to make friends. If they're the new kid or they're just really shy. Lots of students have trouble making friends, and it's completely normal. A lot of these kids join clubs or sports teams to become friends with people that share the same interest. If you share the same interest as a friend you can talk for hours on end about something you're both interested in. Which is something a lot of kids can't do, whether it be that they're too shy, that they haven't found their best friend yet, or their friends have different interest, and thats okay, but it's also good to have friends that like that same things as you. When I was in sixth grade I was extremely shy and I didn't have very many friends, so I decided to join the track team. I met so many people that I'm still friends with now, in eighth grade. Spending hours with these people at school and then going to practice and games with them really expands the friendship and makes it so much stronger. Your friends will come and go, but the friends you meet from a club or activity will last your whole school career and maybe even lifetime.

Being a middle school student can be hard. You may not feel like you always fit in and you may feel like you really don't belong. Joining a team or a club can help make you feel like you belong. Being apart of a team makes people feel important and loved. People that join teams or clubs have groups of people by their side and it feels good to have a team have your back. Joining any extracurricular makes it seem like you have your own tiny at school family. As they're together almost all the time your bond isn't really a big friendship it feels like you are all a big family. This family like feeling is great for kids who are feeling a little lost and need more guidance in their lives. The coaches or teachers that lead these activities set good examples for the students, give them advice, and even mentoring when it's needed. The coaches and club leaders really step up and help get they're athletes or people that participate in the club back on the right path. These clubs, activities, and teams are designed to help you become you best self.

Joining a club or sport also does a lot for our mental health. In a lot of clubs there is a huge amount of volunteer work that is required. Volunteering makes you feel like a better person, but also helps someone in need. Doing something to help someone else is good for our mental health and release chemicals to make us feel happier. Sports and exercise produce similar chemicals in our brains. Working out can make us happier and more focused. When I come home from practice I'm always in a great mood and I can always sit down and do my homework well. Doing sports also helps with the amount of sleep you get and how good and deep your sleep is. As students we need the best, and as much sleep as we can get. We're growing people that go to school for 7 hours a day, have homework, and chores. School life can be exhausting, but I've noticed that when i workout, and get more sleep I'm always in a better mood. One of the reasons we're ""moody teenagers"" is because we don't get enough sleep and it's so easy to change that. Extracurricular actives effect our moods greatly and it's so important that we take advantage of the positives. Another reason why extracurricular activities are important for our mental health is because it takes our minds off of school. School is so stressful and its hard for us to deal with the stress we're facing because we're only in middle school a lot of us are still kids or we're barely teenagers. Doing extracurricular activities helps get our minds off of our school work, homework, test, and quizzes for a couple hours a day, which is super beneficial to our mental health. Doing things like running, drawing, or writing reduce stress and can someone happier.

It's so easy to get caught up by school. You should always have time to step back and take a break, and I think one of the easiest ways to do that is by doing an extracurricular activity. The extracurricular doesn't have to be athletic or academic. You could do a fun activity like Lego Robotics or playing video games. Being apart of something bigger than yourself is very important and I think more schools should start making extracurricular activities a requirement to pass or graduate, because it forms good bonds and friendships, after school activities have positive effects on our mental health and mood, and being on a team makes students feel like they matter and are important. Extracurricular activities can really change a students while career by giving them an outlet to preform and enjoy what they love. I think more schools can take notes from the schools that are making clubs and sports a requirement. ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
9EBA120196BC,"I agree this decision because, if kids are bored they could do activities after school. Or learn different things about the things that the principal said. It said that you can participate on the year book. So you can also help those people by finishing the work they have left. And you participate on sports for example doing exercise and learning how to play that sport. And everybody can serve the student council. And after trying one of those you might like it. And you might want to join one of the activities. Or there might be more than one activities so you can try. ""So go try the activities and learn those new things that your learning and I'm sure you might like them and maybe you might join one of those activities.""

Some people might be mad look upset because they donÃÂ´t feel like choosing one but am cool with it. I agree about must participate in one extracurricular activity because I can make newer friends or the new comer can make new friends easier and it give us some thing to do while we wait until our parents comes home.

First, sometime it is hard to make new friends you at i new school and nobody knows you and u feel alone. Your parents or teacher might say say hi and you might mike a new friend that half a lie to me it easier said then done. Now you donÃÂ´t know how people will react to a samples hi,hello,or sup they might give you a a sink face or a nasty face but having some activity you can make some that like to do the same activity you like to do .yall might make a brotherhood or a sisterhood that can happen with this.

Second, I know sometime our parents have to work like a hour later or something. Having these activity give them time to go home and do what they got to do I know most of those activity ends at five or six and sports ends at seven sometimes. That give to time to make dinner or whatever go home eat do homework go to sleep or chill easy as that.

In conclusion having these activity help our parents and it help us that why I have agree with the resins that every student must participate in one extracurricular activity because it help us make new friends i believe it will make it easier and give our parents enough time to get off of work and do what they got to do.  ",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
394E5EF1B5AC,"98.7% of people don't want to participate in school activities because in their minds, a little voice is telling them, ""Why do school activities when there is no point in them?"" Shut that voice off and think about if school activities would actually help you in school. I strongly agree about students participating in at least one hobby because you can be helping your school out and the other people around you. Participating in a school activity can help you get a more healthier mind, raise money for your school, and help you with teamwork skills.

First of all, having a clean mind makes your body feel healthy and energized. It can make you feel less overwhelmed and help you think about other important things. School activities can help a lot with dreadful and depressed times, that is why it is a great idea to participate and have a cleaner mind. It can help with a lot of your problems and can take your mind off of a lot of things.

Therefore, participating for your school can help them raise money. The money they raise can help families in need for shelter, clothes, food, or anything they need to survive. The money can also go to book stores, clothes stores, shoes stores, toy stores, and anything families would be thrilled to have. It can put a smile on your face helping the families in need.

Lastly, partnership is a great way to fit in, it can help you make lots of new friends and explore the meaning of true teamwork. Teamwork is a good way of being respectful, for an example, if your having trouble on a sport or different hobby, someone could step in and lend you a helping hand. Working together on sports, projects, and different types of hobbies, can make a lot of things easier for you. Making new friends helps you have a fun time and makes your life a lot better.

In conclusion, having a cleaner mind, helping families in need, and having partnership skills are all great ways why you should participate in school activities. It can make you feel amazing inside when you help other people around you. Helping out your school can actually be a good feeling, it gives you a positive mind set and can help you for your future. Before telling yourself "" There is no point in school activities,"" think about how it can help you, families, friends and your school.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
2B98EC6BE001,"Have you ever participated in an extracurricular activity? If so, you know that they are intellectually stimulating, and can be beneficial to the lives of students. I believe that every student should participate in an extracurricular activity. All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they teach life skills, help shy students get involved, and keep students occupied.

Extracurricular activity participants learn life skills. One life skill is time management. Time management is a difficult skill to learn at any age. If students participate in an extracurricular activity, they will have to learn to balance their time so they can complete homework and study, along with another activity. Secondly, these types of activities can teach students how to work as a team. At some point in the future, they will have to collaborate with co-workers in their job. Lastly, even though students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, they are able to decide which club they want to join. This teaches decision making and can help these students in the future. Extracurricular activities teach life skills needed for the future.

Participating in extracurricular activities is beneficial to students who are shy because it gets them more involved. My sister, Generic_Name, started sixth grade this year. She was a very shy fifth grader, so my parents were worried that making friends was not going to be easy in middle school. My parents made her choose one club. She decided that yearbook club would be the best club for her to participate in. On her first day, Generic_Name was very nervous because she did not know what types of activities they did in yearbook club, or anyone who signed up. After school that day, I asked her if she enjoyed yearbook club. She told me that during lunch, they went around the school taking pictures of students for the yearbook. She also told me she met three girls who were also in science club. They wanted her to join them for the next science club meeting, and she was excited about attending. The next week when I was in the hallway, I saw her taking pictures for the yearbook with her friends. She was laughing and talking with them. Generic_Name was no longer a shy fifth grader. She had found friends, a hobby, and had learned to be open to trying new activities.

Participating in extracurricular activities helps to keep kids occupied. First, it keeps them out of trouble. If they homework and a club, they have to manage their time wisely, so they don't have time to get in trouble. Next, if their parents work, it gives them a place to be instead of sitting at home alone. With two parents that work until five, it is nice to go to soccer practice instead of being home alone. Finally, it keeps kids off devices. In a world like today, devices are everywhere. Students use laptops at school, and then they go home and play games online. Going to an activity after school reduces the time that students are on their devices at home. Participating in a club or extracurricular activity helps to keep students occupied.

I believe that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities teach life skills, help shy kids get more involved, and keep students occupied. If you know a student who is not involved with any extracurricular activities, encourage them to find one that they are interested in and give them your reasoning. I guarantee they won't be disappointed after their first meeting.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
C23622128006,"The Principal at our school has recently made an announcement that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity. But, is that a good thing? Well I at least think so. I agree with the principal because extracurricular activities like sports, cubs, and the year book have positive effects on us students. For example.

Sports, sports help us students physically and mentally by encouraging dedication, self confidence,team work, and hard work. For example, when we are in sports we must be dedicated to getting better and actually put in the work to get better. And sports help us with self confidence cause we do our own part and that effects the whole team. It helps because we must learn to be confident in our self to help the team in the best way possible. Team work is one thing that is displayed in sports. Us and our team mates must work together so that the team is the best it can be. Hard work also plays a role in sports because we must work hard to get our skills and our body in a position to be able to do the best we can. And last but not least it helps us create bonds and relationships with our team. Our sports team is like family and the thicker and stronger the bond is the better and more prosperous our team becomes.

Clubs are also good extracurricular activities because when we participate in them we learn new things, we get to know people, and we get to have fun. There is a club for a lot of things and it is an amazing place to learn new stuff and we thrive off of it. Clubs are also a good place for us to find new friends and they have a good chance to like very similar things as us and might just become one of our best friends. And clubs are also really fun. I love nature, helping people, chess, video games, etc. and if there is a club for it i can have fun. And so can you.

The yearbook making is also an extracurricular activity, and its cool too. Because we get to exercise our creativity by creating cool Desines and chose the outcome of the cosmetics to the yearbook. We also get to know the people we work with. Also maybe become friends with the people we work with, and it is always good to make a friend right. But if thats not good enough, we would just be helping and if your a student or your child likes helping just as much as I do, creating the year book would be perfect.

So if you disagree with the principals decision maybe rethink your decision. Because sports, clubs, creating the yearbook, or any other extracurricular activities benefit us in so many ways like. Teamwork, determination, self confidence, creativity, friends, and fun. So maybe consider signing up or signing up your kid for one of the extracurricular activities. And give it a try before you fight against it.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
2754EA322F36,"I agree that students should have to take an extracurricular. Have you ever had to take one? I have, and there are so many options! There are sports, art and life skill classes that I think can all have valuable lessons to teach students. An extracurricular can benefit some students who are already involved in an extra activity, help your grades or athleticism, and it can improve your social skills with an activity such as being in the student council. They can help you in so many ways which is why is think it's a good idea for everyone to have to take at least one.

I think teaching students about things for example, how to take care of themselves and what foods are healthy and which ones aren't can help them outside of the school environment. If a student learns how to be healthier and learns different ways to exercise then their performance in their sport is going to improve. It'll also improve their scores in gym and make them an overall better athlete. Iv'e also experienced this on my own. As a runner, things like your diet and exercise plan are important. Learning early on how to control and manage these things will help you all around. So, an extracurricular being mandatory isn't bad at all if it is sure to help you.

Most activities that the school offers will help a student academically, which is why they're always encouraged. There are so many options for classes because there is always something you can be better at. For instance, taking science exploration will make you better in science. There is almost always a class that is related to one of the ones you already take. Classes that aren't like computer technology, band, or Spanish help you prepare for things later on, even if there isn't a core class directly related to it. Taking Spanish is a great way to improve your English. For me,

Spanish is counted as a high school credit, so that when I get to high school I would already have a credit counted towards my diploma.

Another way one of these classes will help you is that it will definitely improve your social skills. Every class that you will take is going to have other people in there, that at some point, you are going to have to work with. Teamwork is a great life skill that everyone should learn. You can't always do everything on your own, and might need someone else's help, so knowing how to work with other people to achieve a common goal is important. Classes related to theater or yearbook involve a lot of communicating with others and if it's hard for you then these courses can help you work on it. Other things like being in the student council can teach you leadership, which is just as important.

Overall, I think that extracurricular courses always have something to offer to your education and prepare you for things you do in your everyday life. There are so many different classes you can take to help you with whichever your studying, or whatever you enjoy the most. I don't think that iv'e ever taken one that hasn't helped me in some way, and I enjoy most of them anyways.

I think that having at least one of these classes everyday is a good idea, and I hope you do too!",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A544DE716883,"Did you know that 87 percent of students at Generic_School do an activity outside of school? Well, I'm one of those students doing an extracurricular activity. Forcing students to do an activity not only makes them disinterested because they are being forced to to it but also may make them uncomfortable around new peers they might not know. Students already have so much on their hands, why give them more to do.

Many students already do extracurricular activities outside of school. Making them do another extracurricular inside of school will make them have too much on their hands. I do swimming in a team outside of school every day. The practices are grueling, long and hard, sometimes even extending up to three hours. While I'm in the cold water that stings your skin every second you are standing still. In that moment you're just trying to put one hand in front of the other because you're tired from all the other sets. You might be asking whats going through my head at this moment? Well, I'm just trying to figure out the best possible way to do my homework effectively once I get home, so I still have some time to spend with my family. When I get out of swim I am exhausted by the amount practice we had to do, so all I want do do is go home and sleep. But, I remember that I still have homework to do and I have to eat a healthy dinner. By the time I go to sleep it's really late because I stressed to much over homework. With swim taking up a majority of my afternoon I will not be able to do other extracurricular activities.

Having to stay after school can create complications among parents. Some parents will not always be able to pick up their child. Not all kids have a mode of transportation home actually many don't. In this area people may be wealthy and have cars, but still not all people use cars some use buses. For example, our school does not have running after school buses every day, just Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays so on other days parents will have to pick them up which is not quite convenient. Many parents work till 6:00 pm to support their families, so therefor ariving home around 6:30. Students staying till almost 7:00 pm will probably not make them very happy because they have to stay an extra four hours at school. Another, complication with might occur is that many clubs you have to pay for some small things here and there not all parents might be able to support the extra cost that might come in. Which parent is going to pick up their child can also impact how much time they get to spend with their family.

Kids want to build relationships with everyone their family. Kids like having relationships with their parents and brothers/sisters. Studies have shown from Stanford University that kids who built relationships with their parents at an early age are more likely to ask them for advice. This can lead to more trust between kids and parents as they grow up. This is not only good because they have a trusted adult to talk to, but also because later in life when they need to open up about something that was not a good decision they are more likely to do it. I open up to my brother more than my parents because he understands me more. This is mostly because he's up with the current generation unlike my parents which don't exactly understand today's music and dating life. He often helps me solve my problems which is nice because usually I don't have someone to talk to. Relationships with anyone in your life always need to be put first because they can't even compete with how much less important extracurricular's are.

Extracurricular activities are important but adding them in school doesn't help, many students already do an activity outside of school. Enforcement on a certain activity not only makes students want to do it less, but also less effort is put into schoolwork and other actives. Kids often love spending time with their friends and family whether it is inside or outside it doesn't matter to many because all they want to do is spend time with their family. Overall, making students participate in a school activity doesn't benefit the community.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
158F2C1BBEF3,"Johnny is a senior on the RockFord Varsity High school Football Team. He is the star quarterback for his high school and his recreational team. On top of that he takes four A.P. classes. Johnny normally gets home at ten everyday will little time to do homework. Johnny has learned how to manage his busy schedule but, there isn't any space for any other activities. Every season Johnny has to miss two football practices because he has concussion training for both teams. He barely gets to hang out with friends due to the lack of time. Johnny plays three sports but they all take place in different seasons. He plays baseball, football, basketball, and tennis. In addition, he does marshal arts every day for two and a half hours.

Students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities because even thought it can improve social skills, some people may not have the time due to their busy schedules, and also, they may lack transportation to and from home, and maybe they just don't want to participate in these extracurricular activities.

To start off, he had to learn on how to manage time wisely which includes when to eat, when to relax, and when can he work out. Now that he is a senior Johnny has to focus on collage and trying his best to get a scholarship. all of his friends complain that he needs to take some time of and hang but, he always refuses. On an average day he gets home at ten, does his homework for a hour, sleeps from twelve a. m. to four a. m, goes to the gym at four thirty, then he gets ready before school at sixth a. am. Johnny plans his calenders months ahead so that in the future if anything happens he is prepared and able to work around that interference. With his packed schedule he does nothing he wants to but what he needs to. Johnny has been doing this schedule for a year so he's accustom to it but any changes to his schedules can cause a major chain reaction and as a result, it can affect his sleep, behavior, and his physical ability. For example, Johnny's best friend Ronnie stays up all night playing video games and eventually he got adjusted to it. Ronnie was considered a pro player and made money off of playing video games. Then his mom made him play baseball which took away his playing time. So then he barely had time to play games.

Secondly, another aspect is transportation. Johnny's parents arent buying him a car until he goes to college. His mom drives him to all his events and activities even though she has work and other things to tend to. They have two find the right schedule so that their schedules don't interfere. With two other siblings in the house the fight for the cars happens a lot. His family has three cars. One for the dad who is always at work and never home, the second is for his mom who takes him to where he needs to go, and the last one is the car that his brother and sister share. With everything that goes on at home and outside of home the struggle for transportation is real and therefor it would be hard if an extra activity was to be added. Just like how famous artist have schedules on where they performed how they get there , and when they do Johnny has a specific schedule in which he has to follow in order to keep the flow of things going.

Lastly, you can't force someone to do something that they don't want to do. A huge part of school is having fun fun. What some kids find fun others may not. If you're going to force someone to participate in something that they don't have a choice about at least make sure you have a huge variety of activities listed for each student to choose from. It will just be a waste of time for someone to just be sitting there staring off into space. Josh likes playing virtual reality games but the school doesnt have it so therefor he is stuck doing something that he does't want to do.

In conclusion, these extracurricular activities are too time consuming, they take more time off of their normal schedules, involves more driving, and goes against what the student wants. A lot of kids dislike school so making them stay longer than usual makes it seem a lot like detention. Students should have the option to choose if they want to or not so that schedules don't interfere and so that they student is able to enjoy them self.  ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
B40DD5822E7E,"Not everyone likes to be in extracurricular activities or have or have to stay after school. Sometimes it can be tiring and it can put a lot of stress on you. That can really be hard on you as a kid. But I am here to tell you why we shouldn't have to be in extracurricular activities.

There are many reasons why we shouldn't have to be in extracurricular activities. One would be that other kids might have things they have to do after school like dance practice or softball practice etc. so that would make it hard for them to be at both or have a miss one of their practices. Two maybe some students just don't want to do extra stuff for school maybe after a long day at school they just wanna go home and relax or watch TV. Another one could be that they just don't find it appealing and they can start lacking in it and not helping out in anyway. That is just coming off of personal experience.

Some other ones would be that some students will do it just to act up in that class. I have seen people that has caused so much harm to a class or a sport because someone made them do it and they really don't want to be there. If I was the teacher personally I wouldn't want a student on my team or in my class that it there just to act up. Next, some kids will do it because their friends are doing it. You all want kids that are going to do it because they want to not because they see their friends doing it.

Others might be that they could be doing just to waste your time. Personally if I want to do something I'm gonna do it but I'm not gonna waste your time but other kids don't ever think about that. Another one would be that they might not be doing it for the right reason. Most people that I have seen have got into something just to say that they are in not because they want to help they, just want to make their self look good and thats not OK. We can't always force someone to do something they dont want to do.

I honestly disagree with this decision because there could be a kid or a select group of kids that like to start fights or want to harm other students. I wouldn't want to work in that type of environment where I'm scared to even ask a question. You all should let the students decide for themselves what they want to do. If you don't all the stuff that I told you might happen it might actually happen. You have to give us the chance to decide what we want to do in life.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
406445F43B9B,"I do not agree with the principal's decision. All students should have their own choice if they want or don't want to stay after for the extracurricular activity. And what if a student can't stay after school because they have divorced parents and they need to go to their mom or dad's house the same day that the extracurricular activity is? Or what if the student can't go after school because they live far, or they have to take care of a relative when they get home?

If the principal is making students stay after school to do an extracurricular activity, and they have to change their whole schedule to fit around it, that's not right. I think the students should have a say if they want to or don't want to do the extracurricular activity.

I feel like the students should have a say weather or not to stay after for the extracurricular activity and I highly disagree with the principal's decision. Many kids have other things to do than just homework when they get home from school. Things such as sports, taking care of family members, jobs, and many other things that students do after school have to come into accord when thinking about this new decision. For example, students may want to spend time with family, and having to go after school to do an extracurricular activity that no one has a choice if they want to do it or not could be taking away from their time with family. And not all kids like sports, they may not be athletic. Or maybe they don't work well in groups in the student council, and when the student council walks around from class to class announcing upcoming events happening in school, they may not be good at talking to a group of people, such as those in a class. To add on to that, students may not be great photographers for the yearbook. There's always something that someone doesn't have a strong attribute in. The students should always have a say in what they want to and don't want to do, because it could be affecting their lives, and this should apply to this new decision that the principal has made.

I disagree with the principal's new decision that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity, and I feel like the students should say weather they will participate or not. For example, students may have things to do after school that could prevent them from staying after and doing the extracurricular activity. Or maybe they aren't the most athletic person, and they don't want to participate in any kind or sport. Maybe the student is not good at public speech and doesn't want to serve on the student council. The student maybe be bad at taking pictures, so they may not want to work on the yearbook. If the principal is forcing students to do things that they may not like, or not be very good at, it could put them in a place where they feel forced to do something they don't want to do, and they can get angry. I feel like the principal's decision that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity is wrong, and students should say if they want to or don't want to participate in the extracurricular activity.        ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
44E2726DA1B3,"Your principal has decided all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree because now days all kids do is stay home and be on there phones and do nothing. I know that because I used to do the same thing before and i didn't like to do anything at all but then I started playing a sport and it help a lot but i think that. Participating in a extracurricular activity may help you by staying healthy, get you out of trouble,and get you in a good college.

one example is staying healthy by playing a sport you can help prevent a lot of things like maintain a good weight, and keep you from getting sick. Keeping a good weight is good for your health because it keeps you from getting other diseases,more than 1/4 of the people in the U.S. are obese. Why not start at a young age and prevent from being sick and other things. Another thing that can help is eating healthy, we can prevent sickness to in order to do that you might want to think about trying out a new sport.

Another example is getting you out of trouble you can avoid a lot of drama. I learned that social media can get you into a lot of trouble, half of the time a lot of the drama comes from social media. Maybe if you join a club or a sports team you can think before doing something that can get you in trouble. One time my friend made the soccer team but she got in trouble so they kicked her off the team and she learned from her mistake and never got in trouble again. When in your in a cub or playing a sports half of the time you don't have time to be in drama get in trouble.

Last example is joining a club, working on the year book,serve in the student council and, playing a sport can get you into a good college now a days colleges are looking to see if you have participated in any sports or clubs. When i graduate high school i want to go to college and a study to be a general surgeon and participating in a sport or joining a club can help me get into a college. You meed new people when you join new clubs and make new friend ships. When you want to go into a club or in sports do something that you like not something your friends like or something that can help you in life with.

In conclusion staying healthy,getting out of trouble,and going into a new college can help you when you participate in a extracurricular activity. staying healthy by playing a sports and eating healthy can prevent you from getting sick. Staying out of trouble can avoid a lot of drama from school and social media think before you do something your going to regret . Joining a club or participating in a sport can help you get into the college you want and you can meet new people and make new friend ships.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
C818ACA9DB76,"Generic_Name what are you doing? Generic_Name soon stopped looking at the bored and saw Generic_Name oh nothing just wondering what club I should join. maybe do the art club you love to draw and I should join too. okay I will do it. all students must participate in at least one activity because they can help students improve there talent, kids can learn something new, and can get students to get future jobs.

To begin with an activity can help students improve there talent. first kids can start to express more of what they like a example is a boy in my school really loves to knit but he never told anyone about it but when he saw other boys join a knitting club he started to improve and told his friends. Another reason is some kids may stop doing there talent one way is a girl in my neighborhood stop sing because she never joined a club or did chorus so she stopped doing it for a very long time. finally student may continue with there gift in fact 85% of adults do the things they love in conclusion an activity can help students boost there talent

Next kids can learn something new. one way is a few schools tell kids to do a different club which helped students a lot. a example a boy I know disliked tech-ed but ones his school told him to do it he started to really like it. next students start to join more clubs one way is a student in robotics started to join different clubs from the fact that he or she knew that he or she had more than one talent. finally sometimes students dont know what there talent is one example is a friend named Generic_Name is frustrated that she does't know her talent. in conclusion students can learn something new.

finally students may get future jobs one way is students may start a company one example is a adult in my neighborhood has a company and it was because of a club. next there talent can help them with interviews for example some interviews look at more at your talent and how you do in school. finally teens in high school and middle school get jobs for money for example 90% of middle and high schools have small jobs in the summer in conclusion students may get jobs in the future.

I'm so glad that we chose art class! said Generic_Name. i think the principal did a good idea of us doing at least one club. at first I didnt think it was a good idea but now I understand why he did it. lets get in the club again next year in conclusion all students must participate in at least one activity because they can help students improve there talent, kids can learn something new, and can get students to get future jobs.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Many students have personal issues going on at home, they might not be athletically inclined or creative, or they have a mental illness or a personality that makes it hard to communicate and participate. There are many more reasons.

Some students might have personal issues going on at home. Kids can have parents that are getting a divorce. Some kid can go through a loved one passing away. They can have experienced a parent getting arrested. Some of them face many more difficulties.

Some students might not be athletically inclined or creative. Kids may dislike sport activities due to many reasons. Students might only watching the activities instead of doing them. They might also dislike the activities because they have to do them physically. These reasons can make a student not have courage to pick an activity.

Some kids have mental illnesses or personalities that make it difficult for them to communicate and participate. Many kids struggle with autism and become shy towards their peers and guardians. Some other kids can be antisocial or they might dislike having friends and be a loner. These kids shouldn't be pressured into something that will make them be uncomfortable. Everyone has a comfort zone and that should be respected by all.

I do not agree with students being forced to participate in an activity. I don't agree because students might have personal issues at home, might not be athletically inclined or creative, or they might have a mental illness or personality that makes it hard for them to communicate and participate.

00C2C86DCC23,"In my opinion I believe the principal nor the school has the right to make someone join extracurricular activities. Sometimes after-school we have things to do just like the teachers instead of playing sports or joining a club. We could be doing something useful like homework, helping our parents, or making dinner. If the principal makes use do after-school activities im going to join a club or maybe try a new sport like volleyball or maybe i could even try flag football.

Therefore, the principal does not have the right to make us do any sort of sport because the last time i read the handbook i didnt see anything about having to do 1 extracurricular activities, but on the other hand if i wasnt busy after school i would most likely try out for the soccer team because soccer is one of my favorites to do at school because sometimes i get to play with my friends.

I hardly disagree with this whole argument because it would feel and look like regular school all over again even though we meet on different days the school will still be very packed full of a bunch of kids and the school will have to pay the lunch ladies and the bus drivers extra money.

In conclusion, i believe that the principal should just let the kids try out for sports that they want to try out for and not have to force them because they are not only hurting us by putting pressure on us but they are alao hurting the schools budget.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
2939F620E6BE,"What if one day your principal made an announcement and said that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. What would you do? Would you be filled with joy and help implement this new found rule, or would you rebel and cause a ruckus in the school system? Either way my standpoint on this topic is to help and not cause a fuss. As a student roughly in the middle of my school career, attending extracurricular activities have always been a part of my life and they have helped because they make friendships and bring others together, they teach us skills at a young age that can and will be helpful in the future, and it is an amazing, safe, and controlled environment to learn and have fun.

Extracurricular activities bring people with similar interests together and thus creates friendships. In elementary school I participated in the school play, it was so much fun performing a show and preparing for the show with the many practices. Each time we had a practice we would have to go around the gym and each meet a new friend. Each time I did this I would go out of my way to find someone who was looking sad or in a bad mood. This in turn made everyone in a better mood to have more fun. Most if not all extracurricular activities have a way that brings others together.

All extracurricular activities have a purpose for having them, most of the time it being learning a new skill. In seventh grade I was apart of the student council or SCA. In the student council we learned how to plan and control an activity, we learned how to be a leader in many scenarios. As we learned to be a leader we also got to have fun and use our skills. In a normal middle school classroom, we would have to intake a lot of information and then spit it back up on a test or quiz. In extracurricular activities we get to use our skills to actually learn, and learn information that that will be useful in the future.

In the world today it is harder and harder for kids and students to find a safe environment to grow up in and spend most of their time in. There have been a couple times where because I was a part of an extracurricular activity I could escape others asking me to do the wrong thing. Because of extracurricular activities I have grown up in a place that accepted me for who I was. If I did not have extracurricular activities I would probably be getting bad grades and skipping class, just because the people I would have affiliated myself with.

As a student of nine years extracurricular activities have helped me become who I am today by bringing others together and making friendships, teaching new skills that I can rely on in the future, and creating a safe space to learn and develop as a human. I have met so many deer friends because of extracurricular activities and I am still friends with most of them. I have learned new skills and also built upon former skills with extracurricular activities that will help in the future. Extracurricular activities have given me a environment that is safe and comfortable to learn and develop myself in. Overall extracurricular activities have taught me a lot about the world and myself, I will continue on my journey that is life and participate in extracurricular activities as I learn and grow.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
296228784AA5,"Do your kids only want to stay inside and play video games? I know that I would love to do that, but the principal thinks that us students should partake in a extracurricular activities. I don't like the idea of that, but he is right. Students should take part in extracurricular activities. If kids just stay inside and play video games or watch videos on YouTube or Disney+, we could grow up to be dependent on other people, we wouldn't be strong, and maybe become very violent.

The first reason why kids should take part in extracurricular activities is because if they just play video games and watch videos on YouTube, Disney+, Netflix, or Hulu, they could get lazy and depend on somebody else to do things for him. This also ties in to the fact that I said that they wouldn't be fit or strong. If they spend their whole life not doing anything productive, they won't be very strong and if somebody asks that kid to lift something up, they may not be able to do it.

Since I already talked about the second reason why kids should takes part in activities, lets take about the last reason. Some movies, videos, and video games are very violent like Call of Duty or GTA. Kids that play those type of games may think that all that stuff is normal and become violent. They may start to say bad things or destroy stuff. If we let them play many different activities, they they may develop teamwork skills and make friends.

That is why I think that the principal is right and that we should let kids play extracurricular activities. It may help the future generation of kids. Don't you thinkl that it is a good idea?",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
77CD03AA7E0F,"Some schools require students to participate in extracurricular activities. However, schools dont think it all the way through on how it will affect its students. Some students come home from school exhausted. On top of that, they still have homework and other after school activities. A required extracurricular activity may interfere with a students after school activities and some students may just not want to participate.

Most students play sports. Extracurricular activities can affect attendance at practices and games. Students also play instruments and do other activities outside of school. It may interfere with completion of homework. Some students even have jobs that they have to attend to. Overall, its not a good idea as it will interfere with almost everything and anything students do after school.

After school students may just not want to go. They already spend 7+ hours at school everyday. Students might be tired and just want to relax at home. They might want to hangout with their friends or spend time with family. They might not even care about the extracurricular activity so they dont participate. All in all, students that dont want to go probably wouldn't show up.

In conclusion, I disagree and believe that extracurricular activities shouldn't be required. If you want to stay after school then thats your choice not the schools. Schools that have this required should change it to optional.

ECA4D673EC46,"""From the moment a person is born, they are entitled to the right to choose."" Loathing going to an extracurricular activity is no fun feeling for young scholars. I strongly disagree with the decision of having every student participate in an extracurricular activity because it can problems for other activities they do outside of school, takes away their ability to choose, explore and find new hobbies, and can effect a students academic performance.

A large percentage of students have something extra going on outside of school and adding onto it wouldn't be okay. For example, student who has to work to help their family is already taking on a lot. They have school life and family to think about. If a student were to be forced to choose an extracurricular activity, that would put more stress on them to keep up with said activity and the life they already have. Another example would be if a student has to take care of younger siblings or sick family. Having to go to that activity would force the student into a corner where they can't take care of their family properly. The parents may not have the time or money to get a caretaker or to it themselves. Last of all, it could change how much time a student has to themselves. Having time to rest and do something fun is necessary to keep from being too stressed. Less time to rest means the scholar can feel more stressed and could effect their moods.

Young scholars need to experience having a choice in what they do so they can explore themselves. Young students thrive off the ability to choose when they are given a choice.

Making a student choose may cause them to lose the curiosity of finding new things on their own.

Scholars would lose interest in the activity they have had interest in later in life if they had discovered it themselves. Activities like playing sports, helping with the year book or being on the council will put unnecessary pressure on the student to make choice they didn't want to. Extracurricular actives give students the opportunities to find themselves but if they are forced to make that decision to quickly, the point of it all is lost and they may feel trapped .

Academic performance is the most important part of adolescences school life. For instance, students who need to do extra studying and work to keep their grades up will lose that time. That activity will take up more time in their lives and force them to put down the book more often. That will deifnelty make a students grades suffer depending on the activity. This could effect a scholars ability to get into a dream collage. When I students grades start dipping because of an activity, the collage they want to go may reject them because of that. Hearing that they didn't get in may put them in a position where they have to settle for a collage that won't help them with their future goals . Lastly, students who do sports may have to give them up because of their grades. This will cost them scholarships and big opportunities in their future. For some students, that could be detrimental to their future because not all families can afford collage fees.

I adamantly disagree with the unfair decision of scholars having to be in an extracurricular activity. It can problems for other activities they do outside of school, takes away their ability to choose, explore and find new hobbies, and can effect a students academic performance. The negative effects in will have in their future are too risky. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
CAD24215C906,"""School activities can help a student grow, learn, and be taught more about adulthood."" said Generic_Name. My principal has made a policy where a student must take at least one extracurricular activity. The school gives lots of choices like sports, student council, and you can also work on the yearbook. You can find many more of the activities through your school website. I agree that all students should participate in an extracurricular class throughout the year.

These activities the school has for you to participate in could help make you friends. You could make friends by joining the soccer team and connecting with new people. Making friends could help stop bullying or lower the chance of it for you and your friends. Making friends could increase the grades of yours since you have a friend to help you when in need. Extracurricular classes could start some really great friendships during the school year.

One other important thing a school activity could help with is finding a job. Kids don't usually know what they wanna be when they enter high school or even college, so maybe these activities could help young kids get an idea of what they like to do. Helping kids find out what they like to do could really help the kid see what he or she would like to be in the future. This could also help kids get used to what they wanna do, and then when they enter college, they will already know what they want to try. Extracurricular classes or activities will increase the percent of how many kids know what they want to do when they grow up.

Extracurricular activities could help make school and life more fun. Fun is something a child or kid needs in their life, and elementary school through middle school should be fun times. These activities like sports and other things could really help you have fun in school or out of school. Playing a sport you love can help make friends and show you what your interests are, which makes life more fun. I have also had an experience of playing a sport for the school during my middle school days. It was very fun making relationships with others and I decided soccer was what I wanted to do in college.

My principal made a policy that says all students must take an extracurricular activity and I agree with this policy. Outside school activities or in school activities or anything like that could help in so many ways to a persons life. Helping find a job, having fun, and making friends could all help with the future and the present. These activities aren't just something to skip out on, they are something to try. Trying something new could change someones life and could help with decisions through adulthood. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Students must participate in at least one sport, work on the year books,or serve on the student council.

Extracurricular programs help the students stay healthy,caleberate with others,educate them with different understandings, and have a perductive time.

Have you ever wanted a yearbook? yearbooks have many memories, and excitment . You can be apart of this exciting journey. The yearbook is a man made iteam that you help make. The yearbook also shows how you've grow up over the years. The yearbooks price will be 15$.You can capture the excitment,the memories, and the price of 15$.

Have you ever wanted to play a sport? Sports have been on this planet for many years. Their's so many options you can choose from like basketball,soccer,baseball, pingpong,cricket,or even swimming.

I agree with the principle because i think humans should be more active than stay in their rooms all day. most people wont agree so the principle might need to start making incentives,lets go over some incentives.

First,you can make deals or start a point based system,for example the more activities you do the more points you get. All your points could be used for different items you might choose. I think more people will do more activities if they get a point based reward system.

Second,you can also give them school credit by every activity you do,but the credit should be in pieces,for example,if a kid does 3 activities then he gets 10 points for grade. Dont make it that all the students can is do activities and get an A,it should be like two activities = 10 points etc.

Finally,the school should have a student of the month type of thing,were whoever has the most activities done gets to be the student of the month while also having some benefits. There should int be any repeats so it can be fair and not just one kid can be the student of the month for 3 months straight.

8FAAAECA64BD,"I do not agree with this idea. It will not benefit all the students. This plan could cause students to feel more stressed out. Some students may be busy and wouldn't be able to attend practices, meetings, and other types of gatherings for these activities. Students also may not have a way to these activities and this could lead to these students missing out on important information.

This idea may lead to stress because students could feel obligated to excel in the activity they're participating in. Extracurricular activities also add on to the amount of school work and homework students have. This could cause students to panic and they may rush through their work and this could cause them to do poorly on assignments. Stress levels could increase for students and it could cause them to perform poorly in school. Students may also stress about information they have missed about these activities if they missed a meeting, a practice, or any other types of gatherings for the activity.

This leads us to our next topic. Students may have important events to attend the same day as a meeting or practice. This could cause students to miss important information about upcoming events for that activity. Students then would have to catch up on missed information along with their school work. Depending on the activity, this could lead to major problems.

Students may not have a way of transportation to these activities. This could lead to many missed meetings, practices, and any other types of gatherings for the activity they're participating in. If a student were to participate in a sport and they didn't have a way of transportation to the practices then the student would be kicked off the team and they would have to find a new activity, this may be difficult to do. This applies for other non sport related activities as well. Missing these meetings could also lead to confusion and spending time figuring out what a student missed and informing them about the situation.

Extracurricular activities stress out and put pressure on some students. This may lead to doing poorly in school. Some students may miss out on important information.

D5474D29854A,"Having to stay after school without a choice, right after an eight hour stressing school day is the very definition of miserable, is what some might say. Students should be able to choose whether or not to participate in activities that are extracurricular. Extra curricular activities are activities that are extra, not required. Requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities should not be done because activities should not be forced, students already spend eight hours a day at school, and don't have the time or transportation.

Extracurricular activities are activities that are supposed to be extra. Having to require that all students do one, is taking away the definition of the word. Activities should be done of free will, not by force. Students may be stressed having to do something that they did not want to do or do not even care about. Extracurricular activities are out there for people who want to do them, not for those who do not want to. Students participating in something that do not enjoy or care about, is apathy. They do not care about the activity which causes a negative aura around those who do care about the activity.

Students on average spend eight hours a day at school, five days a week for about eight to nine months with holidays included. Eight hours in one thirds of a day, leaving only about sixteen hours left. Another eight of those hours goes to sleep and the rest to free time. Out of those eight hours of free time, one or more of them goes to preparing for school, then another for homework, and some for chores. After calculating it, in truth students only have about four or less hours of free time to themselves. Like all people, students want to be able to do what they want. They have dreams and goals that they want to achieve, but it does not mean that it is school related. Requiring students to take part in extracurricular activities that they do not want to do is not justified. Students deserve to enjoy themselves and have free time. They work hard on assignments at school and learn, they deserve a break. It doesn't just apply to the students, teachers too, have time that they want to spend on other things. In order for such extracurricular activities to work, a teacher will be required as a monitor.

In order for students to participate in extracurricular activities, students need transportation. Some schools do offer transportation, although it is only on certain days. Many extracurricular activities require students to show up after school, some on days that there might not be the transportation that they need. Finding someone to take you to school or where the extracurricular activity can take time.

Force, time, and transportation are some of the reasons on why extracurricular activities should not be required. Instead, they can be made as an extra credit grade, which will make more students want to do them. This way, students will not be doing it by force, but by their own decision, and the principal does not have to worry about students not participating in extracurricular activities.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

I disagree with ""

All students must participate in sports work, or the year book

"". Because a lot of people are are busy after school. They to look after a little siblings, like me i have to look after my little sister. All the time after school and go to school the very next day. I get stress and busy and end up not being able to do after school activities like i want to do. There would be no space for me to, i have a very busy schedule. looking after my sibling is a full time job.

Firstly, People dont want to do things after school. If everyone did, then it would be over flowing with people. No-one would focus on the task ahead. If i were them i would just talk to my friends and nothing would get done. The classroom would be really hard to manage if everyone was there. Would there be specific grades doing this at a time or is it really everyone. I dont think who every in charge can manage that. Theres way to many kids in the school to split everyone up accordingly. For example, what if some wanted to do group project for the yearbook, the other didnt. how would they be split up if one group is to small. Some people just dont like all the commotion

Secondly, some kids dont have transportation. For them to get home they cant just walk home either. So how are they gonna get home, if theres no transportation provided. also, how would people get home if there parents are at work. Do they just stay there forever and ever. if they do stay there for how ever long where would they wait in the school?

if they stay outside they would freeze because its really cold. For example, What if someone parent said they were coming but didnt at the end. How would they person go home if there ride canceled. The buses are gonna be gone and home by the time the activities are over.

Overall, i disagree with the whole situation not everyone can do after school or sports. Because there busy and some people just dont like it, Trasportation the biggest deal though beacuse anything can happend your ride can be canceled in a matter of secounds.         ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
04906D555188,"Do you think students should have to do extracurricular activities? Because in my opinion I think not. It is quite unnecessary and uncalled for. And here is why, it cause a huge workload increase, less freedom for the kids and rides would be super difficult so the school might have to pay for transportation.

If students had to do an extracurricular activity do you think that all their school work would just go away? Because it wouldn't just disappear. Since it wouldn't go away the workload would increase by a lot, and that is honestly just uncalled for though, these kids get enough work. Also if you think about it in perspective the higher the workload the worse the grades, because you are causing the students to focus on different subjects and stuff. I'm sorry but I just disagree.

If you were to be given an extracurricular activity you would be given less time to spend your life as a kid. It takes more time and effort to do something extracurricular. So then you would be giving the kid less time to just be a kid. They would be all caught up in school that they wouldn't have time for video games or going to the park and hanging with friends. That's not what life is about. You're trying to teach these kids about life? Well that would an awful way to help your cause.

Not every kid is going to have a ride, so if the school would like to spend money on that then go ahead. But since most schools don't have the money for that they aren't going too. Lots of schools such as mine have a low budget. My principal won't spend money on anything and it is kind of sad. Also not every parents wants to leave work early to go get their kid, or maybe they're doing something at home.

So in conclusion I don't think students should have to do an extracurricular activity. It will cause a massive workload increase which is very unnecessary. It gives less freedom to the kid to just be a kid and you need to just be a kid sometimes to enjoy life. The schools are going to have to pay for a transportation method, because not all parents would like to leave work early to come get their kids or maybe they are sick that day.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
B9B653AD964E,"The principal decided that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity which includes sports, working on the yearbook, and serve on the student council. Do I agree or disagree with this. I disagree with this because every student in the school must or forced to do an after school activity. Three main examples are students grades, students not caring, and

The first main reason is the students grades. Now extra curricular activities could effect students grades for example, sports activity requires you to keep good grades to stay in the game such as Basketball, Football, and tennis this could stress and overwhelm the students in trying to keep good grades so much they could possibly fail. Then you have yearbook making and this could just tire the editor in the yearbook making curricular because of how long editing takes and typing.

The second reason is most students will not care. If you force students into doing something they would not enjoy they may not care for it as they did not want to do it in the first place, so the extra curriculum would be pointless by most students and would be usless for the school to do these and this could also be a waste of student time as if this plan fails this could potentialy be a waste of school resources and school time, with the exception of football the other two activitys will fail.

The third reason is less time at home, and what

I mean for this topic is that extra curricular activitys could hold them in school for said amount of time therfore when they get home after said amount of time they will be tired and may have anything to do like homework and could possible lower moral at school due to them staying longer and less time with their family.

To sum up this essay i explained why forcing students to join extra curricular activtys was a bad idea with three examples and with those three exaples i supported them with my opinon on why forcing them to join afterschool activitys was such a bad idea and how we should not do this with the opinons i had.         ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
9F6A70DBE7A4,"Many teachers hear students say, ""Why can't we have free time?"" Well, when your principal allows you to have extracurricular activities, then I think it is safe to say there are no negatives in having it. Even though some students have their own opinions on saying if they want to go outside or not, extracurricular activities don't limit them on that. They just simply allow you to get a break throughout the school day, and everyone needs to have a break. Let me explain three ways why extracurricular activities are beneficial for students.

The whole purpose of having an extracurricular activity in the school day is so that students have something to do. This isn't supposed to be boring for the students, they are supposed to be having fun and taking a break from school. In addition to that, this can allow students to set goals for something they have never tried before. If students don't get a break in between the school days, they will never learn because their brain doesn't have time to rest. One more thing, I am a student myself and when I am bored, I am bored. When having other activities to do before and after school, these activities has allowed me to balance out my social life and my school life, due to the fact that I am not stressing over work.

When doing this, you can also make a future out of it. I say this because if you are trying something new, it could be something you do for the rest of your life. Otherwise, if your principal never brought up these activities, then you may have been a whole different person and never knew that you were wanting to make a career out of it. In addition to that, this is also important because Colleges like to see you doing stuff other than school, Colleges don't only focus on your education, but they focus the same amount on sports and/or other activities. This is just another great way why extracurricular activities are needed more often in school. These activities can also bring on new ideas that you can address to your colleagues at work someday, and you will remember to thank your principle for bringing up the idea.

Finally, I feel as a student that extracurricular activities can also benefit you as a student to making new friends. Many people can say that making friends is a dream come true because it can increase their communication skills, share thoughts, and make bonds. When making friends, some people feel accomplished that they have made friends because it is a goal that they have always wanted to achieve. Secondly, communication skills plays a big roll in your life, it allows you to communicate with your colleagues at work, or even somebody at a bagel shop. Sitting in a classroom all day listening to your teacher talk, isn't allowing you to communicate and that is certainly a problem. Making friends differentiates you from your social life and your school life. School isn't the most important thing, but if you are having trouble with something, call your friend up because that's what friends are for.

In conclusion, I feel that it is evident that extracurricular activities are needed in school in order to benefit the students social life and school life. I would like to restate that students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity. It allows students to have something to do, it can allow them to pursue in that activity and make a career out of it. Finally, it brings in the opportunity for students to make new friends. In the end, there is nothing wrong with giving balance in your life, productivity always wins in life.         ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
15DB2779EC7A,"I think the the principal is right. Did you know that the kids who do exercise activities learn faster and there brain can concentrate more. As a principal you are supposed to be looking out for the children and caring for their education. The reasons why I agree with the principal is because kids can get bored sometimes and have nothing to do, kids also need to stop being so lazy all the time, and maybe kids could find talents that they didnt even know about.

The first reason why I agree with the principal is because kids can get bored sometimes. If kids have nothing to do they can go play there basketball ball game that day or go practice outside. Instead of sitting on the couch all day watching TV they can go to chess club or any other clubs in there school. If they go do school activities they will get more exercise and can use there energy for more than just pressing buttons on a remote. For example I made b-team soccer and since I made it I get to spend with friends more and see my other family more.

The second reason why I agree with the principal is because kids now adays are very lazy. They dont listen and all they want to do is sit on the couch and watch TV or play video games. I love watching TV and playing video games but I still get up and go outside or go play with my brothers or sisters. Being lazy is not a good thing you will get no where in life if you are lazy all the time. I love going to my practices and spending time with family TV and video games are allways last in my life and maybe it should be for you to. And also doing school activities will allow you to spend more time with friends.

The third reason why I agree with the principal is because kids could finds talents that they didnt even know about. If you are lazy all the time you wont wont ever find out things about yourself. For example if you are one of those kids who are known as the kid in the corner and you dont ever try anything new you wont ever be able to acclompish your dreams. And also if ypu find out that you are really good at basketball or soccer you could one day maybe because a famous NBA or MLS player. If you found out that you are really good at something and you made really good money off of it you could give some to charity or to hospital or to churches. If you find a talent that your really good at you could inspire others to do the same.

Those were the reaons why I agreed with the pricipal. I hope me telling you all those things help you learn that lazyness is not the answer. I really hope that I inspired you to agree with the principal. So hopefully now you will get of the TV or video games and go spend time with family or go to some after school activities and enjoy the freedom you have because not everyone has that freedom.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
5EE8CB200D9B,"Does your principal want you to do at least one extracurricular activity? Well I'm here to tell you that it is a great idea. Many people that is in a extracurricular activity love it. Being in a extracurricular activity has many benefits to it. Some of the benefits are the new friends, the college application, and it is enjoyable.

Making new friends can be very difficult for many people. But there are other people that make new friends because of the extracurricular activities. Being in a extracurricular activity can make getting new friends much easier. You can share and bond over the experiences you might have had. Being able to have the same interests as your team can be a great conversation starter.

Some of the extracurricular activities can look great on a college application. Any sports activity can defiantly help with getting into a great college. The team building you do in the activity will look good on your permanent record. And there are colleges that now look at how you behave with other people and how good you work with them. Being in at least one extracurricular activity can prove that you can behave around other people.

Being in a extracurricular activity can be an enjoyable experience. Some people might think that being in an extracurricular activity can be a waste of time. But for other people, the new people that you meet and the activities you get to do can make their time there worth it. The fun games, the people, and the new things you learn can be a great experience. And even if you aren't good at any of the activities, there are people there that will help you through it.

I defiantly agree with the principle making students being in any extracurricular activity. Even though there are people who might disagree with the idea. I think it is a great way for the students to get out of their comfort zone and start making new friends. The activities they have can guarantee an enjoyable experience. And when they start looking a colleges in the future, they can get in thanks to great behavior they displayed. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
955DC5092AF1,"I agree that students should participate in 1 or more extracurricular activity because it can work on their teamwork skills,get them exirsize, and let them do something other than work for a little. They don't have to actally do what they dont want .If they don't want to pay soccer and they want to clean up they have that choice but there will be groups and they might not always get what group they want. If they get outside and play sports or even pick up trash from outside it can help our community. All of these students want to do is be on a computer or a phone and doing these activities can help them be use to being of of these electronics.

I think the students should also have a say in what activities they should do because people don't like doing things they don't injoy. We could play sports, pick up trash from the football fields, work on their homework if they are behind,and walk the track. They are so much more we can do to get these students doing. I think don't think it's good for students to be just doing work all day until 3:00 half way throuhgh the day they need to be doing something relaxing or something that's getting their mind of of work for maybe just 20 or 30 mins a day.

So I do agree and think that all students should participate in 1 or more exrtacurricular acttivity a day. Do you?",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
E2D6958F6FC4,"Ugh! Sigh! Thats the sound of boredom from a child. They are unhealthy, have know friends and no imagination, but that can all change. On the other hand you could be playing some exciting and amazing sports. I agree that students should participate and be involved with at least one extracurricular activity.

Exercise is a really great thing and your kids should have a lot of it. From doing a sport for an extracurricular activity this would really benefit the amount of exercise the students get. The students would get in really good shape if they kept doing it. The number of obese kids in the United States is higher than ever because, kids are not getting enough exercise. Playing a sport helps your health out. It helps your cholesterol, your heart rate goes up, and it gets your blood flowing. This can also result in weight loss. I know the boys will love to show off their muscles to the girls. Showing how much weight they have lost and showing them how ripped they are. Besides that, think how much fun you will get to have. You never know you could possibly get really good at the sports and make it to the professional league.

What if your not really into sports. Well then yearbook is definitely the place for you. You get to work with hardworking and creative people to make the best yearbook ever! Working in yearbook benefits you in some many different and exciting ways. It helps you develop your creativity and imagination skills. You get to be part of the amazing creation of the school yearbook. You get to help customize and decorate it to make it look mind-blowing! Working with people in yearbook help you communicate and socialize with other amazing people. You can create ideas and combine them with your fellow workers. If you have an idea for yearbook, don't be shy come out and share it with us.

Doing and extracurricular activity helps your social skills and helps make or meet new friends. I don't know anybody that wants to live their life all alone. That's why doing and activity helps you communicate an with new people that could eventually someday be best friends. Extracurricular activities benefit you in helpfulness, acts of kindness, and most importantly friendships.

An Extracurricular course could benefit you in so many was. It helps your exercise,sociability, and creativity. I agree that students should participate and be involved with the activities. I think that most students wil enjoy it others will not. That's what life is not all people agree or decide on the same thing.                ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
0A1890ABABEB,"""Love for exploration"", ""keen to try new activities"" and ""always on the lookout for an adventure"" are mottoes that no longer describe the human race and now belong in cheap inspirational posters sold for a few dollars on amazon. Let's face it, our whole species does not deserve to take credit for the hard work and intellectual genius a few humans exhibited when making major world-changing discoveries, but it does. We consider ourselves ready for adventure, exploration, and discovery, when most of the youth of America spends time locked away, stuck in a rut, performing the same activities every day. However, even though I deny the fact that currently most of us engage in exploration, I affirm and stand by the belief we can change. There are multiple ways through which one can learn to crave for the unknown, and one of them is by implementing it into our school system. Therefore, I stand by my principal's decision of mandatory extracurricular activities, for I know the concept of exploration in itself, the access to experiences one can't normally get at home and the encouragement of social interaction with peers who share your interests, are key steps in the process of growth.

Nowadays, kids, teenagers and even adults do not explore activities as much as they used to. The excuses one might give for this are all some variation of ""Oh, I simply don't have the time anymore!"" to ""I am just too tired and don't want a bigger workload."" These claims, however, don't justify our situation, for most people do have free time even if it is to a short extent and this is especially true when one is referring to kids and teenagers. The true cause for this type of lifestyle is no one other than ourselves and ""our ferocious love of the 'known'. It is easy to stay stuck in cycles, but it is hard to dive into new hobbies on your own since the majority of people like 'easy life'. Mandatory extracurricular activities are the 'hard exploration of new hobbies' implemented into 'easy life' because most teens are used to going to school and not used to discovery. Some might argue the change to their school schedule at first because it disrupts their 'norm' but they will get used to it, and many will come to accept this as a new part of their life. The goal is to make discovery of the new the norm, and that can easily be achieved through this change.

Secondly, the 'new' we are striving to get can hardly be found at home. Clubs are specialized on a subject or type of art and often have unique equipment which enhances the learning of it greatly. It is a privilege to have the access to this equipment, and making the most out of it should be important. This also relates to the fact that many might not be inclined to try a new activity without having the guidance of a teacher or professional. With clubs the encouragement increases, and that is a key-part of wanting to try the new experience in the first place. As an example, consider art. There are multiple online courses an aspiring artist might try, but they could potentially be discouraged by it since it is not as an engaging of an experience. In an art-club however, a teacher is there to help you by providing materials, encouragement and also knowledge, making one more inclined to try out the new activity.

Finally, it encourages social interaction in an online and person-to-person aspect in a growing world where it is needed, and lacking. Through extracurricular activities, one might not only find more friends, but they will find friends whom they share interests with. There are two reasons as to why that is crucial for a growing teenager. The first being, 'it's nice' and the majority of people like friends, and the second being that it enables for mutual growth and also encouragement in the pursue of said interest. Sociology (social science) shows that a person who particularly enjoys an 'out of the norm' activity such as coding might be discouraged from pursuing it if peers they interact with do not pursue the activity themselves. An extracurricular activity helps you find people who perform the same activity as you, form connections with them, and prevents you from being discouraged. This can also apply to online environments. Many might argue, ""Wait, isn't our lack of person-to-person interaction coming from social media itself?"", and my answer is that yes, but no. People seek online interaction because it is easy to find others who share your interests and passions, but in result, they sometimes end up eliminating a chance for real life relationships. However, extracurricular activities on themselves help improve the problem, because not only will you have more time for real-life talking, but if you really enjoy the activity, you might seek people which talk about said interest and turn your online experience into something semi-educational.

Extracurricular activities have a huge, positive effect on us and are therefore, crucial . We need exploration to grow as a society and the earlier we learn to realize this, the better. Some schools such as Generic_School have already implemented this ""mandatory"" rule because of the great benefits it bring to students. It allows us to grow and explore new interests, encourages us to pursue said interests by providing us with teacher support and also need material, and they help us make connections by meeting others who are like us and have similar goals and objectives. However, it doesn't end there. It is in your power to continue to explore your current interests and discover new ones for extracurricular school activities don't last forever. So if one truly want to follow amazon's inspirational posters, you must remember that it is mostly your choice. Don't tell yourself ""I don't have time"" and dont be afraid of a bigger workload, the pursuit of an interest is rewarding, and enables opportunity. Who knows, maybe you can become the next genius whose intellectual property wants to be stolen by the whole human race.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
5DAF24E0E18F,"How would you feel if on the first day of school your principle said that you needed to do an extracurricular activity, because I know that I wouldn't like it. You might be thinking to yourself,"" wouldn't that help keep our kids active,"" or,"" wouldn't it keep them out of the house doing something productive?"" There is a chance that they would be productive, but there would also be a chance that they would goof off and not do what you thought they were doing. One reason I disagree with this is because we would have less free time to do what we want. I disagree with having to do an extracurricular activity because there would be more work, less free time/more school, and extracurricular activities are not for everyone.

To start, all of the students would need to do more work if everyone had to do an extracurricular activity. There would also be less time for homework everyday, because you would be staying after school. If you were playing a sport, it would feel like your having PE again. There would also be more learning if your in the yearbook crew, or school newspaper. In all, you would have more work if you had to do an extracurricular activity.

To begin, having an extracurricular activity would give you less free time to do what you want to do. An extracurricular activity would also give you less free time, because you could have a game at another school the day before a big test that you need to study for. Having to do an extracurricular activity would also mean more school and less time to yourself. Less free time would also mean less homework, which would mean worse grades. In total, having to do a extracurricular activity would give you less free time because you would have to stay after school.

Finally, not every extracurricular activity is for everyone, like track isnt for people who hate running, or soccer isnt for people with broken legs. Some people might like it, but I also think that some people wouldn't make the soccer team, or track team if they're not athletic. Some people might like technological things, but there isnt an extracurricular thing for that. My final reason is that not everyone could make the team, or yearbook crew, because they are not for everyone. In all, no one should have to do an extracurricular activity.

To start, extracurricular activities are not for everyone, they are for the people who want to do them. No one should be forced to have to do an extracurricular activity. In conclusion, more work, less free time, and extracurricular activities are not for everyone, are reasons that I think we shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
0F2E9FA7DAF4,"""All students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity this school year. Whether it's a sport, like football or cheer leading, Or a club such as theater, you must choose at least one activity to be in."" Said Principal Generic_Name as he spoke loudly into the school's mic. A handful of students in Mrs. Generic_Name's 7th grade homeroom groaned and complained from hearing the announcement made over the intercom.

One reason I believe that students should be able to decide if they want to do extracurricular activities is because, students might already be doing another sport or club outside of school. For example, he or she could be on a travel basketball team or cooking club and have practice everyday after school, so they do not have enough time to participate in any extracurricular activities that the school is forcing them to do. ""I already play on a travel basketball team and have practice everyday for 2 hours, i'm way too busy for this!"" Generic_Name shouted grumpily.

Another very important reason students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is because, he or she might be involved with a religion that requires them to go to church frequently. For instance, one student might have bible study on Wednesday nights. Another student might have to go to church every Sunday and won't have time to join a club. ""I have to go to church a lot because of my religion,"" said Generic_Name adding on to Generic_Name's comment.

The next reason is, some students might not have have enough money to buy or rent the sports gear they need. He or she might not be able to afford the proper items you need for a club or sport. They might be embarrassed because they cannot afford what the rest of the students can. The other students might make fun of them for not having what they have. Generic_Name walked up quietly to the teacher's desk to tell Mrs. Generic_Name something. ""I don't think I can afford to buy what the other students can buy."" Whispered Generic_Name. ""Do you need to go to the counselors office?"" Mrs. Generic_Name asked. ""Sure"" Said Generic_Name. Mrs. Generic_Name quickly wrote him a pass and sent Generic_Name on his way.

Finally, another reason I disagree with this decision is because some students might be trying to focus on their grades or keep them up. Whether it's so they can get good final results on he or she's report card, or wanting to impress and make their parents happy, getting good grades is a great thing to focus on. ""Mrs. Generic_Name, I want to be able to focus on my grades so they can be high."" Generic_Name said in his unusual, nerdy voice. ""To be honest, i'm just not interested in doing any activities."" Generic_Name complained. ""I might as well send all of you down to the counselors office at this point!"" Mrs. Generic_Name said as she was laughing. She quickly scribbled all 4 kids a pass just as she did for Generic_Name.

""Good Morning students, welcome back to another day of school."" Principal Generic_Name exclaimed into the mic. ""Yesterday as you know, I told all of you that you had to do at least on extracurricular activity, but since we got so many complaints about it, I have decided to give you a choice. You can choose whether or no you want to do an extracurricular activity."" Principal Generic_Name said. All of the students who complained jumped out of their seats and shouted with joy. ""Phew!"" They all sighed. ""So much stress is lifted off of our shoulders!"" The kids said excitedly.                  ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A47DE80009C8,"Sports, yearbook, and clubs are all after school activities. They all help you get involved in your community and school. Being a part of an after school activities is awesome because you can meet new friend and have fun. Some people dont like getting involved in after school activities, but what if you had to be involved in at least one because the principal makes you; So would you agree of disagree with this rule. I would agree with this rule because getting students involved in an after school activity is a good thing it can teach them leader ship and they can also make new friends. they are also be active by being a part of an after school activity keeps them off the couch.

When part of an after school activity students can develop leadership and new skills. by being part of a school sports team students can learn leadership and they can stay active. if you are the best player on you chess club team then you can help the other people in the club and help them get better.

When you are a leader on the football field like a quarter back you need to be paying attention at all times. The can also help in the classroom because you could also learn how to pay attention in class more. no mater the activity you are apart of you can allows learn something new and learn how to be a leader.

Being part of an after school activity can help you become more active and even loose a couple of pounds. if you are on a school sports team you can stay active. Even if you are only going to a ports team conditioning most of the time every school sports team does something to stay active and stay in shape, and even after the season is over you can still stay active and exercise on you own so you can be ready for next season. being on a school team you can do and learn so much from your coaches and you can even learn a few things on your own.

When you are part of an after school activity you can meet new people. If you cant make any friends at school then you could join in an after school activity and make a hole lot of friends. If you never try and make friends you will just be only all the time and have no one to hang out with and goof around with, But if you do get involved in an after school activity you can make friend s and maybe even if lasting friendships with people that went to the same school as you you would just never talk to anyone. So being a part of a school activity could change your life.

So that is the reason why I agree with making everyone be a part of at least on e after school activity they can accomplish so much. I just think that not being part of an after school activity what would you do. Joining an after school activity wont heart anything it will only help you it will help you learn leadership and new skills. It can also help you find new friends that you might end up hanging out with all the time.               ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
F7FACDD619D9,"One of the hardest things for a student to do is feel comfortable in their school environment. Whether a student is extremely insecure, has low grades, or does not have that many friends, they often struggle to thrive in school. Requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity is a way to solve this problem because students will feel safer and like they belong at school. Students participating in a club will have the opportunity to meet new people. Additionally, students will benefit physically because of the positive health factors that they will get out of participating in a club. My personal experience has taught me all the benefits of joining an extracurricular activity as well.

If students participate in an extracurricular activity, they are very likely to meet new people. Members may become friends with people who they would not have met if they were not in a club. Often, students in the same club have similar interests, and will become close friends. These friends will prove to be very helpful throughout students' lives. Students will also have the opportunity to meet students that differ from them. These students may be older, younger, a different race, or a different religion. Students that have a relationship with someone that is different from them are benefited because they see different perspectives and are exposed to different cultures. Lastly, members of a club will become closer with adults, like coaches or teachers. The students will have someone they can trust, talk to, and look up to. This shows that requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity is a good decision because they can meet new, diverse people.

Another advantage of being a member of a club is the health benefits the activity provides. Sports, marching band, and many other clubs require physical activity. This will help students stay fit and healthy. Secondly, talking to someone, for example a new friend or trusted adult whom you met through the club, helps reduce stress. Exercising is also proven to help decrease the anxiety that builds up in students' lives. If a student is rid of stress and anxiety, they will be more positive and friendly. Additionally, if some members of the extracurricular activity have healthy eating habits, it is likely that they will encourage the rest of the members to eat healthy. This, like exercise, will keep a student happy and energetic. The positive health factors are another reason that enforcing the participation of students in clubs is beneficial.

I have participated in an extracurricular activity for several years, and I can say that these benefits, among others, have helped me through elementary school and middle school. In the spring of my third grade year, I walked into school and was greeted by my best friend. She shoved a flier into my hands and explained that we were trying out for the soccer team, and she wouldn't take ""no"" for an answer. We tried out for the school's soccer team and eventually got notified that we had made it as starters, players who begin playing on the field for each game. If not for that push by my friend, I would not be playing soccer for one of the best clubs in Generic_City. Playing soccer has helped me make new friends, stay healthy, and reduce a lot of my stress. My experience has shown me all the benefits of participating in an extracurricular activity, and I hope other students can experience this too.

Students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because of the several positive advantages that come from it. The members of the clubs will meet new and different people. Students' health will benefit as well because they will be physically active and their stress will be reduced. Additionally, I have been participating in an extracurricular activity for five years and it has helped me socially, mentally, and physically. Next time you have the opportunity, encourage a student to join a club because it will positively change their lives for good.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
AF3A719533E9,"Hey you! Do you want do something good for your school, or even your community? Well it sounds like a plan. Our principal here at Generic_Name, has decided, that all students must participate, in at least one extracurricular activity. With this decision I agree for three reasons. I agree because it will keep kids busy, out of trouble, and help some of us with our social life.

Being active everyday is a huge importance in life, especially fro us and while we are young. And sitting at home on social media is not going to help, so join a sport, to keep you active for at least an 1 hour or more. If you are going through some personal issues, doing an extracurricular activity can take your mind off of that. So for these reasons keeping our bodies busy is good alternative, rather than being bored.

To have a well organized goals set throughout life, is very organized. If you are someone who gets in trouble a lot, think about setting goals for yourself. For instance, you could set a goal for ways you can keep yourself out of trouble and even getting negativity out of your life. Therefore doing the right thing is never wrong, so do something for the school, that could help you set a better pathway for your future goals. Sometimes there are people in your life that could be a bad influence on you, and to let them go out of your life is better for you than them being there and ruining your bright future.

In high school having your career plan is a good start in life. With the start of your career path, the first skill with that is communication. As a result of a good career, having a social life in high school is important. Joining Student Council Association (SCA), playing a sport, and presenting a project in class, is all where great communication can come from. For example, if you are in the SCA you have to deliver important upcoming events, new changes, and plenty more information for your peers. Now think to yourself. . . "" Do I want a great career or not?'

So with the principal's decision I agree to his decision he has made. Just think about it, doing more is always better including being occupied, staying out of trouble, and boosting your social life. The reasoning for my agreement is because it shows some people do actually care about us, and to me I find that very important.

It helped me from just going home and being a couch potato to being a great athlete now. In my opinion, students should have to do an extracurricular activity because it can help with obesity, you can learn from it, and it can encourage other students to do the same.

One way an extracurricular activity can be helpful is helping with obesity. Some people just go home and sit and eat the rest of the day. It even could be that they go home and just play video games. If you do an extracurricular activity then it can help with not gaining so much weight.

Another way extracurricular activities can be helpful is that you can learn something new. Say that you're in a math club and you don't know a whole lot. Well maybe someone who is in that same club knows way more than you do. So you ask them for help and they start to study with you. You get smarter and later you will be teaching other kids who were just like you.

The third way that an extracurricular activity can help is encouraging other people. If you have a friend group and you all just play video games, maybe try something else like a sport. You will go to that activity and your friends will question you. That activity then makes you an even better person than before. Soon your friends will want to try it and they become better people as well.

This is why in my opinion, I think that doing an extracurricular can help with obesity, you can learn something new, and can encourage other students to do the same.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
3DF2569374B6,"Do you think an extracurricular activity is good for the students. Well their are many activities to do like playing sports, run for class president, or join the debate team. Cause I agree that participating in a extracurricular activity is good for all students.

Also all of your activities reflect on your classwork, grades, and attendance in school. So for instance if you go to school sit in class playing no work is getting done, then you get suspended the sports coach is putting you on the bench no matter how good you are at playing. You can score fourteen to thirty touchdowns or goals, and still going to be on the bench the whole entire game. Then of course we have discipline in this too. Discipline is the number one thing in life you need to succeed. Because if you don't have respect or discipline for your teachers and talking back, then what you think you're going too do with the people who's trying to teach the activity or sport to you. Also some jobs ask what activity where you in through middle to high school.

Then we come to the principal or my reason why extracurricular activities are good for you, Because the trouble that kids can get into when they get out of school. Like all activities activities are not just sports, and in school all day. Their are some activities where you can talk to people about your problems, and what you are experiencing at home. Cause some of them been where you've been, or at where you feel like nobody care or listen's to you. So they can help you,and give advice on how to handle it the right way, no doing something that can hurt, harm, or get you locked up. Also they go on trips, and get to know you.

So all of these activities are to help the students, and give the teachers a better understanding of what the students like to do so that everyone can have fun, and have a bond with each other. Then when you get older you can go back to the same people and say, "" Hey I'm applying for a job, and I need your signature"". And just for you being the best kid all of those years ago they will sign and you have a job that easy.

In conclusion, yes I agree of what the principal is trying to do cause it's to help the students for a better life, and help the teachers to understand the students better.            ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
A44E9E70A83F,"I disagree with the principal for making the students to do extra activities in school.

65% of students are not able to do things at school cause of stuff that happen at home.

If kids were forced to do these extra school activities they would always be in a rush,they might not be able to do it,and their grades might decline.

First, the kids will always be in a hurry. For example kids are not the best at time management most kids are really bad at time management and they are kids not grown adults. Also children might panic with to much stress cause there will always be stuff to get done in a short period of time. But at the end of it all their kids and have other things to do.

Secondly, not everyone is able to do school activities. And not all children have a ride if needed to get where needed to. Also some kids get jobs at a early age so they can help out with their living situation and parents. Some kids do sports and can't do the after school activities.

Third of all, students grades might decline. The reason I say that is even with all the extra activities in school they might loose focus. With all that work the kid might be tired. Kids will get nervous and confused trying to figure out how he can do all his work quickly.

At the end it's all about the kids. The kids should not be required to do extra activities and that is what this is about. Also don't force your kid to do something if they dont wanna do it like sports and other things related. But at the end this goes to all the teachers,parents, and staff so lets encourage kids to do what they want and whats best for them.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
06C88B7A0E1D,"All students should be required to join a after school club or activity. Being a part of an extracurricular activite will promote the well being of the students. Student should be required to join after school activites because it will help them become more succesful, it is an oppertunity for students for students to make new friends, and joining extracurricular activites will help students learn to manage there time.

Participating in after school activites will help students become more succesful. Studys have found that students who participate in after school activites are 58 percent more likley to make A-B honor roll. If all students joined activites and clubs then the majority of students would preform better. A local University found that students who joined clubs were less stressed. Joining clubs and acivites would help reduce the students stress levels. There are some clubs that students can join where teachers can help students with any work they do not understand. Most teachers stay after school at least once a week. I think that if all students joined clubs then students would be more likely to get better grades, have reduced stress, and get extra help.

Joining clubs and other activites is a great way for students make new friends and do activites with there friends. Being a member of a club would allow students to meet new people in our school. Joining a club would give students a chance for them to talk to kids that are not in there classes. Students can sign up for clubs and acivites with there friends. Many students don't have classes with there friends, extracurricular activites would allow them to spend time with eachother. In some after school activites students students can work together to complete work that they dont undestand. In after school clubs students could help eachother. Joining clubs would give students a chance to make new friends, spend time with there friends, and give students a chance to work together.

Some students may be busy doing other things out of school. Some students may visit familly or take care of a younger sibling after school. However I belive that students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity. If all students joined extracurricular activites then it would help them learn to manage there time better and at a young age. Joining an extracuricular would help students manage there time bettwen school, extracurriculars, and there personal lives.

If all students participate in extracurricular activites then students would be more sucessful, give them the oppertunity to be with there friends and make new friends, and help students manage there time. There are also many clubs and activites students can participate in. I strongly belive that it is in all of the students best intrests, to require students to participate in extracurricular activites. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
AFC3A1FDF322,"The principal said ""You must participate in at least one extracurricular activity"". This will be a bad idea and will likely not help the success of students and it could drop a lot of students grades. We should have a choice if we would like to be in an extracurricular activity or not. I speculate that if/when this change happens Students would have a lot more stress on thier minds with how much time they have to do homework and other things. Students are already too stressed and with this rule it would make there stress even worse. Another thing that would happen is that the health of students could be bad with the sleep they would have. Think about it ,Students have school and then they have extracurricular activities and also need to do their homework thats about 10-12 hours just for school work and just imagine how much stress the students who have jobs will have. One last thing that would happen if this new rule goes in place is Students would have less time for themselves. With the students who have jobs and other stuff it could be real hard to keep going to after school activities let alone going to their jobs.

First is that students will feel more stressed out and their grades could be effected because students already feel stressed without the rule in place, with the rule in place they would have a lot more stress and that could effect their grades. Another reason is that if students had a job they would half too quit it because they would not have time to do the jobs. They could even get less sleep and that could also lead to more stress and it could be unhealthy for the student who have homework and jobs. A lot of students grades grades will differently be effected with the extracurricular activities that students would need to do. They should keep it the way it is now because students can still do it but they wont be forced to do it. That way it will let students do extracurricular activities and let the other students do what they need to do. For example they will have more time to themselves and are able to do more things.

Second is that students will be unhealthy and that could also lead to stress and bad habits. One way they could be unhealthy is by not sleeping for that long which can turn into a habit which also causes stress instead of going to bed at 8-10 PM they will go to sleep at 12-1 AM doing their homework and working. The best thing to do is leave it as it is so students would be healthier and use their time more wisely. Another thing we could do is make school shorter so we can have more sleep and have more time to our selves which will make students more healthy and get better grades in school. we should be able to choose or have the choice if we would like to join a extracurricular activities because it would lead to success and healthy habits.

My last reason is that students will have less time for themselves, students need some time for themselves especially teenagers. They are changing and they dont know the world so they need a lot of time for themselves. with them basically forcing us to do after school activities students will feel like they have zero time and some students wont even do their school work which will affect their grade. Again by making school shorter students will have time for themselves for example they can work on jobs or do their homework or other stuff like learning how to drive and a lot more stuff. Also by shortening the time teachers wont half to work as much and students skipping school would probably decrease. Also with less school time more students will go to after school activities so the principal and the students both win!

In conclusion if the school goes with the rule ""You must participate in at least one extracurricular activity"". This will be a bad idea and will likely not help the success of students. it would damage the success of students , make students do unhealthy habits, and give students less time to do things. A fix to this would be to make school hours shorter so students will have enough time to do extracurricular activities and more students would succeed more. This way the student and principal get what they want along with teachers having to do less work. hopefully they will not go through with the decision and instead make school shorter. If they do change it than school will change badly forever.    ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
9AA9AF2C02A2,"Do you think students should play sports? Yes! I agree students should play spots. Students should play sports because sports will help students with they health,keep students out of trouble,and help students stay off technology.

First,sports will help students with they health. When students play sports they have to move around a lot and drink a lot of water. However when students drink a lot of water and move around a lot they can lose weight. Also students will want to eat health food and not junk food. Sport will help out students with health problems.

Next,sports keep students out of trouble. Students will want to do good in school and get good grades to play in the games and to stay on the team. However if students don't keep the good work up they not going to be able to play in any of the games and they will no longer be on the team. Also if students play sports they will stop skiping class and fighting. Sports will keep a lot of students on track.

Last,sports will help students stay off technology. Now days all students do is play video games and sit on they cell phones. Everything that students do today is on technology. However if you look up how many students that play sports it's only 90% of students in the world that play sports. Students need to stay off technology and play sports more.

In conclusion,sports is something that every student should play. Sports will help students in a lot of ways. I agree that students should play sports because sports will help students with they health,keep students out of trouble,and help students stay off technology.        ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
447790D1438B,"Why do you think work experience is always important? Why the athletes are having passion at a sport that they play? Everyone doesn't know how to do things until they learn or practice it a lot. When I was seven, my mom usally ask me to do an extracuuricular activity, so I chose doing tennis. I have lots of fun and learn a lot throughout the lession. I even got to go visit some famos tennis players. We learn a lot and have fun or even gain experience. Every students should participate in at least one extracuuricular activity, because this can help them gain experience as they got older.

This is a great experience to all student that participate an activity, such as a sport team, work on the yearbook, or even serve on the student council. Student should try things that they love or having passion in it no matter what. Getting more experience will also help you with getting in a good college or getting a job that you like. When you are interest in one thing, you should go for it and not wait for it. Everyone should have something that they love or interest in it. You should always go for your goal and gain experience from doing extracurricular activity. Another reason is doing a sport can help you get healthier and even forgetting all the stress from school. Students suffer from school and can not do what they want, so this is also a program that helps student find their interest and forgetting all the stress.

When serve as a student council, this could be fun as the student vote for you and you learn how to become a better council and how to managane your school. This can help you gain experience when you want to become a manager or even make your own company. Sometimes, extracurricular activity can even help you with learning. Some activity can give you the best way to learn throughout the lession. When you are doing a sport team, you learn teamwork and make friends. Having a friendship is always important to a team, you can learn from others. When I already having lots of fun in tennis, I started to try something else, then I got in to a school basketball team. I have lots of friends there, although it is sometimes a stress of lossing to another team, but we still learn the lession from it. When wining a game, we are so happy even go to a resturent to celebrate our victory. This is so important, becuase we can make lots of friends and even wining the game.

Overall, I think this program is a really good experience to all the students that participate in it. It benefits all students when getting older and learn a lot throughout the entire lession and learn from others. Students should always try new things, listen to one anothers opinion, learning how to respect others, and having a open-minded and intelligent. Finally, Every students should participate in at least extracurricular activity. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
1300CBEB1F39,"I stand with the principle on his decision. I believe that participating in extracurricular activities has many benefits on a child's social life. Making friends while on a team or a club will be much easier, the students will have connections with others, and everyone will have something to talk about. Some students may find it hard to make friends, but by being in an extracurricular activity, there are many chances to find a long lasting pal.

You may think, ""It's nice that the students can find a friend, but what if there is nothing they would like or want to participate in?"" Well, i'm sure there is something they would enjoy, because there are many options. If a student is athletic, and likes to play sports, they can join one of the many sports teams. If a student likes to write, they can join the creative writing club. If they like to debate on topics, they can join the debate team. The possibilities are endless!

Although there are many non academic options, there are many academic ones as well. Kids who may need help with a subject can come to tutoring sessions held by other wonderful students, who want to lend a helping hand. If a child has trouble focusing on their homework, there is homework club, a quiet place to work on schoolwork, where a teacher is always there to help, if need be. As you can see, there are many helpful options for students who want to work on homework or other school assignments.

Extracurricular activities can also help shape students into better citizens. There are many clubs that help students learn about acceptance, kindness, and taking care of our Earth and environment. Partnership club is where students work with special needs children. These students learn how to accept and help care for others who are a little bit different. Diversity club is where students who are all shapes, sizes, colors, and sexualities can learn about each others backgrounds, and the everyday struggles they may deal with because of how they act or look. Environmental club is where students can learn about how the environment is deteriorating and how we can help stop it from being destroyed. Also, they participate in many community service projects, from picking up trash, to measuring the PH balance in our water systems. Students learn everyday what being a better citizen means.

In conclusion, asking students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is a good idea. I believe that students school and social life will change for the better. It may take some time to see the positive effects that this new rule will have on the school, but there will definitely be a huge, great difference within the school's community.                            ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
D175BA8792E7,"Have you ever played a sport in school and did not have time to do anything when you got home?

I used to play baseball and every evening when I got home from practice, I would have to go straight to bed.

I disagree that all students should participate in extracurricular activities because you might not have time to do homework, spend time with family members, and have time to spend by yourself to read a book or play video games.

Every night during school the teachers would give each class the same amount of homework, and on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I had baseball practice, and sometimes I had a baseball game on Saturdays which means every two days I would have twice as much homework as everyone else because I wasn't able to get the homework done the night it was assigned. Now that I am no longer playing baseball I am able to keep up with my classes this semester.

Homework is a big responsibility to some people because they try their hardest to keep straight A's on their report card.

Homework can be challenging to some people because they might not know how to do something, so they ask their parents/ guardian to help them but if they some kind of practice after school then they might not get home until 8:30 and have to go straight to bed like I did.

Spending time with your family members can be fun because you might be able to play board games and/or card games.

Spending time with family you have not seen in a long time will help you get caught up on what has happened since you last saw them.

Family is one of the most important people in the world, if God never made you any family you would have no one to go to when your heart is broken, you need help with personal problems, and if you are very old and can not move the way you used to be able to, then they will always be there for you whenever you need them.

Have you ever wanted to just sit down and read your favorite book by yourself, but then your mom walks into your room and says, ""Time to get ready for your game"" just as you was about to start reading?

Well imagine being in the middle of a very competitive game with your friends, and your mom tells you to get p and turn our X-box off, but you ask if you can finish the game and she says,""No, because you need to get ready to go to your baseball game, and they will be there when you get back.""

One time I was half way through the pages of my book and it got to a really amazing part of the story and the I had t get ready to leave, I hated that day because I basically left on a cliffhanger.

Have you ever played a sport in school and did not have time to do anything when you got home. Homework can be challenging for some people because they might not know what to do. Family is one of the most important people in the world. Have you ever wanted to just sit down and read your favorite book by yourself?

09621E6AE55D,"Would you want to sit at home all day,growing lazier by the minute? The principal at my school wants every student to be engaged in at least one extracurricular activity. Not everyone will like this idea because they might not have transportation, or it could interfere with another activity, but we could work around it and I think this could turn into something great! I agree that all students should participate in something because everybody should be active in the school, its a good way for students to make new friends with the same interests as them, and kids can create their own clubs.

To start off you are only in middle school for a short amount of time, so you might as well make the most of it. In my opinion kids should always stay active in their school, like going to sporting events, and joining clubs so you don't waste your time watching TV all day. Also it's good for you to be active, and sometimes you just need a change of scenery. I'm aware that students might appose this for the reasons that they have homework, or better things to do. However homework can be done in class or at the beginning of each activity there can be a designated time to do a little work.

Also this program will help a lot of people make new friends. When a new kid comes everyone gets excited and are always very welcoming to him/her which is nice, but they might feel a little more welcomed if they joined a club, or team full of people who love the same things as them. You also could discover things you never knew you had in common with someone. I think this could really help kids who are shy as well, and they might start to open up more and participate in class, if they find friends that are on their classes.

all in all the school would be a happier place.

Finally one reason kids will love this is that they can create their own clubs. Everyone is unique in their own way, and different people have different interests. You may really love a sport and just aren't great at playing it, or can't play for some reason, and that's OK because you can still share you love for it by creating a club. This is an awesome way to become truly involved with your school because you can make clubs about anything you like to do. For example one person may make a cooking club, or a video game club, or even a homework club for students who feel they need extra help with a subject. I think people will finally begin to feel like they have a place if the principal decides to go through with this idea. Therefore students will be excited to go to school.

In conclusion this will really help the school, and students because there would be something for everyone. students should be active in school, it will help kids make new friends, and kids can create their own clubs are all way this idea should come to life, and why I agree with the principal. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
93E6151BC67E,"A long time ago when I was a new student at Generic_School in 7th grade I joined a engineering club and at the beginning I was scared to meet new people, but then I met Generic_Name and he introduced me to all of his friends and we all had a lot in common. Studies has proven that kids that do an extracurricular activity are less likely to be depressed in the future than kids that do not do an extracurricular activity. Studies has also proven that kids that take an extracurricular activity thrive more in school then kids that do not take an extracurricular activity.

Do you agree or disagree that all students must take an extracurricular activity? I agree that all kids that attend the school must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will get healthier, they also might find a talent or a passion, and they will most likely meet new friends.

First, students will get healthier by doing fun activities and by joining clubs. Another reason why kids get healthier is by doing outdoor activities that gives them Vitamin D. An example of a student getting healthier through extracurricular activities is Generic_Name burning 15 LBS by joining the workout club. Another example of a person getting healthier through fun activities is Generic_Name burning 12,000 calories in just 1 week from joining the tennis team. Therefore, making kids do a fun activity or join a club will make them healthier.

Then, students can find a talent or a passion through extracurricular activities by trying out new sports and joining clubs. An example of a student finding a talent or a passion through extracurricular activities is Generic_Name finding out his new passion was art when he joined the art club. Studies have shown in 2019 that 35% of students that joined a club found a new passion. Another example of a student finding a talent or passion was Generic_Name finding out he was really good at typing when he joined the typing club. Just from extracurricular activities a student could get a new skill or a new passion.

Lastly, students will meet new friends through extracurricular activities by trying out new sports or by joining clubs. An example of a student that found a new friend or a staff member through extracurricular activities was Generic_Name finding his new friend Generic_Name through the gaming club. Another example of a student that found a new friend through extracurricular activities was Generic_Name finding her new best friend Generic_Name. Students that meet new friends through fun activities or clubs will have a less chance of having depression in the future. Therefore, just from making a new friend through a club it can change your future completely.

In Conclusion, you will get healthier, find a talent and passion/ favorite activity, and meet new friends if you join a club or take an extracurricular activity. If we can change the children's lives now from extracurricular activities then in the future they will succeed. Just from joining an engineering club it can change your life into a million different ways.

1B069ADEF513,"The student council is holding a meeting at the cafeteria while the school basketball team is practicing for their upcoming game. These things are called extracurricular activities. The principle has decided these things are mandatory. I think students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities because students schedules and students being forced to do something they dont want to do.

Lots of students have busy lives. Students and their parents could have something planned or reserved for a certain time.( going to parties, a get together, vacations/trips, shopping etc.) The activity and plan might collide, which probably would cause rescheduling and chaos. Students could also already have an activity outside of school. How I see it in my mind is that if someone already takes a sport (outside of school) and now has to take another activity in school. They would have less time, less motivation, and more work. Our four core classes and two electives already give us plenty of homework to do. Doing an activity will require more effort and less time to do the homework from our classes. Whether it be a writing assignment for the student council, doing work for the yearbook club or practicing for a sport.

Students may feel forced to do an activity they dont like. For some kids their might not be an activity they enjoy and then proceed to pick one they dont like. Doing this could make them resent school or feel some type of sadness. Their also could be a large demand for one activity a student has applied for. After applying the student learns hes been excluded because of maximum limit of people in one club. The student is now in a club he doesn't enjoy. If I was in the student shoes i would feel like the school has been unfair or betrayed me. Being forced to do something is almost never a good thing. especially if you don't enjoy it. Forcing anyone to do something they don't want to do could cause a state of depression, anxiety or a fear of it.

However, participating in extracurricular activities would mean less screen time. Students can socialize and plus most teenagers are addicted to their phones and its not healthy for them at all. Doing activities will decrease the time by a good percentage. Being addicted to anything is definitely not healthy but, being forced to do something isnt either. In my opinion more screen time is better than doing something you resent because you are enjoying it and you are also technically socializing by messaging or calls. All in all lots of screen time may not be healthy, but its better than participating in activity you dont like.

In conclusion it shouldn't be mandatory to be in an extracurricular activity because of the schedules of students and being forced to do something you dont want to do. Activities will interfere with these things causing chaos and even resenting school. This is my honest opinion on this decision. If you take the time to think about this decision, you'll realize whos going to be effected and how they are going to be effected. This is why I disagree about having to participate in extracurricular activities.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
89A1E2B6F0A1,"As a student, I strongly, wholeheartedly disagree with this decision. The idea of forcing kids into an extracurricular activity is absurd and unreasonable. The principal, who is supposed to be the 'leader' of the school, forcing everyone to do something they don't want to do is a dictator-like move. Here's an example for you: Let's say Dictator Kim Jon Un decides everyone in North Korea has to stay after work for an hour to paint portraits of him. Sure, a portion of people may enjoy painting, but overall everyone is going to loathe the extra hour because they don't want to do it. That's exactly what you're doing. Now here's why you should never choose to do this to students.

First of all, students have tons of responsibilities. Besides working hard at school five days a week, students have to do homework and study for tests, for seven classes! They also have chores at home that their parents need them to do, in order to keep the house clean and functioning. Many students even have to work to support their families, even after doing all of the other responsibilities I mentioned previously. It's just not fair that you would force them into something else. Older students may be tasked with taking care of a pet or younger sibling, having to come right home after school and being busy all afternoon and evening.

Keep in mind, these are just a mere glance at the responsibilities they have to do every single day after school. Do we really need to burden these children with something else?

Parents of students may not want their child to stay after school. Students may not be able to get a ride home due to their parents working or lack of buses. This would inconvenience everyone. Students have extracurricular activities outside of school as well, and others have a tight schedule that would crush them if they had to cram one more thing in. Requiring them to do an extracurricular activity would be the straw that broke the camels back.

I personally don't think the principal has a right to do such a thing. You cannot keep students after school against their will. Once the bell rings at the end of the day, and they leave campus, you don't get to control them anymore. Forcing ever single student to participate in an extracurricular activity is despicable; you are forcing everyone to do something against their own will. You may think that you're ""helping"" them by giving them a light push, and you're not completely wrong. Not every student is going to loathe going to an activity, but let me tell you, should you do this, there are going to be kids who will suffer.

I also believe, and many would agree, students should want to participate in extracurricular actives. I know how it feels to be forced to do an extracurricular I didn't want to do, and I was miserable. Throughout the entire school day there was a pit of dread in my stomach that wouldn't go away, until I was finally free from the prison they called an ""extracurricular."" I had zero interest in it, and after it ended it discouraged me to try out other activities. To this day I still struggle with trying new things, all because of that one bad experience brought upon me by people like you, people with the power to make decisions for me.

I know that this essay is not going to completely change your perspective. This is one paper, it's not that significant. You may read dozens of other papers with completely different ideas. Though, I at least want you to think about how the decisions you make affect those around you. Think about the prompt i've been given. Imagine you were the principal. What decision would you have made before reading this essay? What about after? Was I, a child, able to change your mind?

If I was, or you agreed with me from the start, I'm glad that my words hold meaning and have power, because it's something I lack. If I wasn't, and had you been the principal, you would've chosen to force every single student to do an extracurricular, I just hope you know that not only have you wasted my time, but your time. My objective was to convince you otherwise, and get you on my side. Though, whatever your stance on this is, on my side or not, just know that you have the power. No matter how many papers I write, no matter how many points I make, in the end, you will get to choose for me. So think twice before you make decisions like that-- where you get to choose for others. Think about what else is going on in their lives; all the other things they have to do. If you got nothing else out of this essay, I at least hope you got that, because at the end of the day, you will get the final say, because you are the adult. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
75C4CC1ABECF,"Student Extracurricular Activities

One thing that connects students and schools all over the nation are the wide range of fun and interesting after school programs, known as extracurriculars. Schools offer lots of extracurricular programs that interest students hobbies and talents from sports, such as football or basketball, to clubs that help out and benefit the school, such as school council or leadership and unique clubs that students share a common interest in such as Harry Potter club or running club. Although extracurricular activities are just as beneficial to a students educational experience as in-school classes, students should be able to have the option to choose whether they would wish to participate in the activities. Forcing a student to participate and serve in these extracurricular programs will deter the quality of the programs, decrease student welfare, and make students even busier than they already are, leaving them no time for other activities outside of school.

If the option to opt out of joining an extra program is stripped from students, the qualities of the clubs can and will decrease. If a student chooses to participate in an extracurricular on their own time, the student will be excited and enthusiastic to engage in the program. Whereas if a student is forced to participate in a club or program, they will be the opposite, and likely will be put in a negative mindset where they believe that they are forced to be there. It's important for students to have the choice to participate to where students feel enthusiastic about the club and happy to be there.

Requiring students to join an extra activity at the end of the day will also create unhappiness among students. Students are already required to be at school and work for 7 hours a day and 35 hours a week. The extra activities at the end of the day can add on up to 4 hours of extra time to the already long school day, making it up to 50 hours per week. Some sports practices even go until 7:30 PM and also require students to meet on the weekends. Students are already exhausted and unhappy with the current school day, and forcing an extra 15 hours a week will have a devastating effect on the previously unhappy students.

Many students are involved in extracurricular activities that are not school sponsored and are run by an organization outside of school. If school forces the students to join an activity, it will take up more time. It will leave students with no time for their other not-school related activities, yet another forced school related thing taking time out of the day that isn't school. Forcing students to join a club will create the same effect homework has on students. They will form a hatred for clubs, just like many students have for homework, because it leaves them with less and less out of school time.

In conclusion, schools should not allow students to choose whether they would like to participate in extracurricular activities because it can decrease the quality of the clubs, create unhappiness among students, and cause students to be even more busy and leaving students unavailable for other non-school related activities. Giving students the freedom to be able to choose whether they would like to participate lets students have more power. Taking away that power and putting just another thing thats forced on to their plate will cause students even more stress and discomfort. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
F215019BE1C6,"Did you know that Generic_Name has decided that all students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity? Isn't that great? Well unfortunately most students don't think so. Believe it or not most kids would rather sit at home and watch TV or play Minecraft rather than take such a great opportunity to participate in something new. I agree with this new decision, that all students must participate in at least one extra curricular though, because students will have a chance to involve themselves in a community, they will get to expand they're horizons and learn new things, and transportation won't be inconvenient for parents.

To start with, students will get to involve themselves in something other than social media and school. Most students don't spend their time doing much more than eating, sleeping, coming to school, doing homework, posting something, eating, and scrolling through they're feed again. Obviously this is an unhealthy routine to keep, especially for young growing minds who need to be more engaged. Therefore participating in something else in addition to your daily life will be highly beneficial. Students will then not only participate in something more healthy but they will also become part of a community. Being a part of a community can be healthy and fun. You gain support and encouragement in a safe environment and meet new people. Granted meeting new people and making new friends one should find no trouble doing. When you join something new you meet new people with similar interests, and having similar interests you have a common ground to start a new friendship easily! Joining a club or participating in an extra curricular activity is wonderful because you can detach from your phone and other work for a while and enjoy being part of a community and making new friends.

Another great part of participating in something new is learning something new. Doing something different is a great way to learn new things. As you expand you area's of interest you also expand your skill set. One of the most important things you can learn while in a community is communication. Communication is extremely important in your daily life whether it's with your friends, family, teachers, employees, your boss, or the nice man who lives two houses down from you. Communication is needed and used everywhere. One can also learn many other important life skills. Let's say you decide to join a sport, you begin learning team building skills, or maybe you serve on the student council, you learn leadership and how to be a good role model. These are great life skills. It's good to learn new life skills such as these and expand your horizons at a young age to later assist you in life.

However as great as this all is parents are still unsure about the new rule, as they have concerns about transportation. Most adults work late, with inflexible hours and have no way to arrange a ride for their child. Well rest assured parents, there is no reason to worry because the school provides your child safe transportation for when he or she is done. Schools have late buses to account for those who stay after school to participate in an extra curricular activity. Parents have no reason to fret as the school has them completely covered as they provide late buses so we can all get home safely and our hard working parents can relax. So although it may seem a problem, parents should absolutely not have to worry about transportation, for the school has made transportation easy thanks to late buses.

Generic_Name's new decision is one i strongly agree with, because students will involve themselves in a community, while learning new things, and transportation is made easy for parents as well. Everyone should try something new and grab this opportunity to achieve all the great things I mentioned. After hearing my position I would hope more students will follow this new rule with an open mind and enjoy expanding they're horizons as much as I will! ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
A603DBD5D182,"Have you ever wondered how professional athletes got their start? Extracurricular activities have a part in that. From football teams to science clubs, students are participating in life changing events. Students create special bonds over these activities, which makes them so important. It is a good idea for principals to require all students to participate in extracurricular activities. These activities are a good way for students to be introduced to one another, they open up opportunities for these kids, and it gives these kids something to look forward to.

Extracurricular activities are a great way for students to meet and bond with new people. Some students are far more shy and reserved then others may be. There are kids who are sitting by themselves every day, and are constantly alone, but having these kids in a school club or activity could really help them with making friends. Schools are constantly getting new students, but these kids might not adapt as well as one might think. Being the new kid is always hard on students, and is sometimes very scary, but having these kids participating in extracurricular's could help students meet new people and begin friendships. Students might be having a hard time fitting in at their school. Being a part of a club where they are surrounded by others like them could help them realize they are not the only people who struggle, and they have people to rely on. Extracurricular activities could have a great impact on a student's social life.

These activities have opened up countless amounts of opportunities for these teenagers. Some families might not have enough money for their child to play on a professional sports team, but these kids are given the opportunity to represent for their school teams. School sports teams can help kids accomplish things they could only dream of, and it can become a treasured experience for them. Students can get the kickoff to their career with extracurricular activities. Athletes in high school are often scouted out by recruiters for college teams, which can end up with these students playing in national leagues for a living. Teenagers can put on their job resumes what they accomplished throughout their high school sports career, or even on teams like the debate team. Accomplishments as big as winning state and national championships, or as little as winning a game can help managers get a sense of who you are. Extracurricular school activities have a higher value in different ways throughout your life.

Students often have nothing to look forward to as they go to school, but having extracurricular activities gives them something to be looking forward to. Some sports teams or school clubs like to hold after school practices or meetings that are mandatory for the students to attend. Kids might be waiting to go to their football practice, or their team meeting, throughout the day, so they can work hard after school and see their teammates and friends. On occasional weekends, or in some cases every weekend, their team might be playing in a game or going to a competition, which causes students to become excited. Some of these students are very dedicated to what they do and when they go out to compete or to play they give it everything they have, and they feel very accomplished if they become the champion. Some of these kids are not getting out of the house very often, but these activities, like sports, give them a reason to. They might not be leaving their house because they have nowhere to be and nothing to do, but playing sports gives them a reason to become active. These activities are the reason some kids enjoy going to school.

It should be required for students to take at least one extracurricular activity. These activities have created many benefits to a students daily life. Shy kids learn to open up to others and to talk to people, while others get opportunities opened up for them. Most kids enjoy these activities, and look forward to them. In the future, more schools should be opening up to extracurricular activities, and make sure all students have the opportunity to be a part of one. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
F035784A0407,"In school, days can feel long, and can drag on, so you probably don't want more time added to it. I think this too, and, because of this, I feel strongly about added time to school days; However, if my principle said everyone was required to have an after school activity, I might have some trouble choosing a side. In the end, I decided, if I'm going to choose a side, it would have to be the side with no required extracurricular activities.

First off, there are two reasons I have trouble choosing a side, despite being against longer school days, first being because everyone is different. Some people have more time, and wouldn't hate having an extracurricular in the way. Others have adaptable schedules, and even more just stay inside too much. So, to reiterate, even though I disagree with longer school days, there's always a different opinion with valid points or second point of view on a matter. This is no different. Of course, though, I chose the other side to really support, so let's get to that.

In support of my idea that school is long enough as it is, is: Why extend it any more? Some people already can't fit school perfectly into their schedules, so why add an extra hour or two? Others may have problems, such as a requirement for therapy, or a sickness, which I'm sure exceptions could be made for, but I don't think they could do it for everyone who has an illness. On top of this, and a much more minor point, what if people don't want to do it? If it's just one school doing it, thus not being a law to attend school at that time, why can't students just leave. At that point, it would technically be illegal to forbid students from leaving. On a final note for this paragraph, what if something happens at home, like the loss of a loved one? Will the school still keep the student from going home?

Another supporting point of my idea, which is closer to a question than a point, is: Why have it be required? There is so much you can do without having be required. You could put up more advertisements, or maybe, make them more interesting, so people will want to go. If you are going to make it mandatory, what is stopping you from just adding more classes? In that case, you may receive extra funding to make it more interesting from the government. Some may thing ""But what if the government doesn't want to support the schools in the adding of more classes?"" I only have one thing to say to that, which is: Maybe, if they don't want to support you in your point, why are you doing it. Theres most definitely something wrong with your idea if the government won't help you.

To conclude, I don't think we should make after school activities mandatory. If someone wants to join one, that is their choice, and it shouldn't be forced upon others if they don't wish too. After school activities are fun because we choose them, and we don't have to do them if we don't want to. We are happy with them because we are free in our choice. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
8C4ED47912C3,"Heres something you might be interested in doing activities outside that you may have never wanted to do before. yes you should do extracurriculars because you could get out of the house more, do something that your really passoinate about and could maybe do that for a living when your older, and you could try new things and expiernce things you havent expierenced before.

Getting out of the house more it could be something as simple as taking your kids to the YMCA. You dont always have to be excersizing to be outside or doing something other than being in your house all day. When you get out of the house you think about things like walking the dof through the neighborhood, or dropping your kids off with thier friends somewhere but you never really think about other things you could be doing when your not busy. You could hands down take a long walk around the neighborhood matter fact you could even jog/run,You could pick up some trash around the neighborhood and watch the ecosystem and get out more.

When you doing something your passionate about you dont wanna stop doing it. So what im saying is if you find the right thing for you your out of the ball park. You have a chance to get away from the world and do what you love doing when your not doing school work or other things like that. You have a chance t be yourself without people judging everything little thing that goes on in your life. Plus if your really goos at it you could do your passion for a living whe your older like you could get a job that has something to do with something your really interested in and getting paid a little better than you would doing something thats not fun at all.

You could try things that you usually wouldnt try when you are staying at home playignvideo games and watching netflix in your room. And maybe if you try the right thing you will really get into it and keep getting better at whatever your interested in. Sometimes your sitting at home bored because you dont spend enough time doing other things like for exam[ple you could go out side and do a couple laps around your house to get a little bit more energy out. All I can tell you is when you find something your interested in you will know it because your gonna want to do it 24/7.

I hope that you really take into consideration doing some extracurriculars. You would really like doing something your interested in instead of just sitting around at home ding absolutely nothing. Some people just take awhile to find what their interested in but when they find it they stick with it until the day they can't anymore.

23393129100A,"I would agree that we school have students participate in sports,work on the yearbook,and serve on the students council..Like if people want to play sports they can,if people want to play football,soccer,etc they can. Let just say if someone wants to play a sport they need to sign a paper to make sure if your child gets hurt you don't sue the school. People sometimes want to work on the yearbook like make the front othe book and then puting the pictures of the students. If you want to workon the yearbook you have to make sure you have the best drawing skills and writting because if you don't have the skills then the yearbook wont look good for the school. But sometimes they have a compition on who has the best drawing of the school yearbook. Also you can be a student council for a day that means you can help out in the office like make sure everything is okay you also help by helpng the teachers that are in the office like with reports other students. This can help you by feeling helpfull and if you want to become a teacher they can help you with that to. So i agreed to this because in some way foortball,working on the yearbook,and help in the council can help you and in your futrue.

A9103BF8F902,"The principle of our school has decided that all students need to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Their decision was announced on the morning news not too long ago. This news got some varying reactions. Some students support the principle's decision, while others don't. I think students should not be forced into doing at least one extra curricular activity for three main reasons.

My first reason for disagreeing with the principle is that I believe students should not be forced into doing things they are not passionate about. For example, a student could have no interest in any of the clubs, so they randomly choose Robotics. Due to them having no passion for this club, they are more likely to do poorly in this club, compared to the people who actually have interest in making robots. They are also more likely to develop a dislike for robotics, due to them being practically forced into doing something they have no passion for. They could also start developing a dread for going to this club because they are absolutely bored-out-of-their-mind while attending this club. And that wraps up my first reason for opposing the principle's decision.

My next reason for disagreeing with the principle's decision is that some students may be too busy to participate in extracurricular activities. For example, a student could be taking all A.P. classes and could have enough homework to last them a lifetime. Other students could also be attending a part-time job, ultimately pushing out time for an extracurricular activity. Or some students could simply think the stress of being in school and having a bunch of homework is enough for them, and would like to only focus on their academic studies at school. There could also be tons of other reasons for students being too busy to participate in extracurricular activities, but those are only a small fraction of them.

My final reason for disagreeing with the principle's decision is that the extracurricular activity could cause them stress. It could also cause them to do poorly in regular school activities. To demonstrate how an extracurricular activity can cause stress, I will circle back to my example involving Robotics. In Robotics, there is a competition element. The competition element requires students to ""battle""/compete against other robots. Therefore the robot has to be built to be in its best shape possible. Students also receive minimal guidance on building robots from the experienced adults around them, due to the fact the that the robot's design must be came up with only the student's mind. This could cause inexperienced robot builders to stress over how to build a robot outside of the Robotics Club (like during school). And due to them focusing on primarily Robotics and not school, they could end up losing focus on school and start lacking academically. This is caused by the student driving all of their effort into Robotics instead of their classes. This example may seem far-fetched, but it must be true in some cases.

Those three reasons are why I disagree with the principle's decision. Forcing all students into doing at least one extracurricular activity isn't a plausible idea because some students could have no passion for any of the activities, others may simply not have time for it, and could cause stress to some students and ultimately lead them to do poorly in school. Now, what do you think about the principle's decision about forcing all students to take part in at least one extracurricular activity? Will you stand against it with me? Or will you stand with his implausible decision, and ultimately against the needs of some of the students?",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
5EF7607660F0,"Are you ever bored when you get home from school? Do you have absolutely nothing to do? I think everyone feels like that every once in a while. Maybe some people feel like that everyday. Our principal only wants the absolute best for us and that's why our principal has made it required that everyone does an extracurricular activity. This is an enlightening idea because everyone can make new friends, extracurriculars' look amazing on college resumes, and you will be super productive.

First off, extracurricular activities should be required because everyone can make new friends. Sometimes it's hard to make friends at school; kids can be horrible. So, when you choose your extracurricular activity you will most likely choose one you enjoy. This will mean that you can make friends with many people who have the same interests as you. When you are put in social situations such as a team, you must talk to your teammates. This will improve your communication skills if you are shy or maybe have trouble making friends. Also, you can connect with your teachers or coaches that run your extracurricular activity. This will create a very optimistic and positive learning environment.

Secondly, extracurricular activities should be required because they look amazing on college resumes. Our principal wants us to exceed all expectations; then in the future be very successful with what we do. An extracurricular activity could help someone like you or one of your many friends get a scholarship into a thrilling and creative school like Yale or Harvard. By the way, colleges love to know that you are a critical and logical thinker. For example, if you did debate team it would tell the people looking at your college resume that you are a very strong minded person and you are fond of speaking in front of others. Those are both skills that may be important to different colleges. Although, you must make sure that you do an extracurricular you enjoy greatly and not one that you do just to put on college resumes.

Lastly, doing an extracurricular will cause you be to be more productive. Instead of laying down playing video games, you can be on a basketball team or help put together the school's yearbook. You can also get some exercise in with your friends. Exercise for anyone physically and mentally is so important so you don't lose skills. Whether it's practicing that perfect lay up or learning how to solve a gut wrenching math problem, everything takes practice.

Statistically speaking, doing social and physical activities can also improve your mental health. Rather than staying up late watching television you can embark on a wonderful book that will make you bursting with joy. Then, the next day at your book club you can share that amazing book; you can talk about how the princess saved herself because she doesn't need a man to save her.

Extracurricular activities are so important and should definitely be required. This is because you can make astonishing new friends, they look drop dead gorgeous on college resumes, and you will feel and be so productive while still having loads of fun. Extracurricular activities are easy and optimistic ways to brighten up your day. Although, it may be boring or hard at times, I can promise that they are the way to go. If you enjoy them a lot, you can sign up for more. Now the next time you are bored just remember you have extracurricular activities that can ensure fantastic experiences.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
72ECF408E30D,"The principal has decided that every student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For example, a student could participate in sports, work in the yearbook committee, or serve on the student council. This decision should be slightly changed so that it only applies to the students who do not participate in an extracurricular activity of any kind. After all, extracurricular activities are beneficial to students because they perform better in the classroom as a result, colleges look favorably upon students who participate in extracurricular activities, and these activities improve the health of teenagers.

It is a well-established fact that students who participate in more activities than just classes which are already in the school curriculum do better in the classroom. They are capable of thinking more creatively about certain questions, are more comfortable and as a result better when giving presentations in front of the class, and cna even perform better in Physical Education. Extracurricular activities, while not solely responsible for this, are a large factor that affects how a student performs in the classroom. For example, Model United Nations is one activity which teaches students about various useful skills, like public speaking. Students stand up in front of the entire class giving a speech, sometimes off the top of their head, on a certain problem affecting the intense world today. Model UN is not only a useful educational tool, however, as it is also capable of helping students think about the world with a new perspective. Many topics given are about finding better solutions to certain issues prevalent in today's world. Students come out of this club brimming with new ideas, self-confidence, and a will to learn. Sports are another activity beneficial to students. They learn skills such as teamwork, cooperation, and even get better sleep at night. One example of this is soccer, which teaches students about endurance and teamwork, all while helping them exercise. These student athletes are able to perform better in the classroom as well as in P.E. because of their athletic capabilities.

College is a big part of life not just in the United States, but all over the world. By going to college, one can get a better education and in turn, a better job. However, just getting good grades in school is not enough for many of the top colleges around the world. Students also need a hook that make them stand out from the others in the eyes of the university. In fact, some colleges have given out scholarships to students for extracurricular activities. For example, playing a musical instrument, like the piano. Not only does this help with how a student does in the classroom, but colleges also look for students with musical talents and even partner with music schools for this purpose. In this way, not only can students attend a college, but they can also attend the music school that comes with it and pursue their musical education as well.

Physical and mental health are a major concern revolving around students. Obesity and depression can both be linked to overworking students and not giving them enough time to go do something else. This is why schools need extracurricular activities. Sports and music are both helpful in this way. At a young age, many children are encouraged to go outside and participate in their local sports team by their parents. The parents do this so the children can get exercise and grow up leading a healthier lifestyle which combines academics and physical activity. Team sports, like soccer, football, or basketball, also teach students about teamwork and build up their self-confidence, which benefits their mental health as well. Team members meet each other just about every week, and over time, this relationship builds into a friendship. Individuals can feel that they belong in the team and treat almost like a second family. This sense of belonging benefits their mental health, which in turn benefits their performance in the classroom, which benefits their life overall.

Extracurricular activities benefit students in their performance in the classroom, attainability of higher education, and physical and mental health. However, the specific decision of the principal should be changed as students may already participate in extracurricular activities not provided by the school. For example, one may take piano lessons with a private teacher, or play on a travel soccer team with no association to the school. By forcing these students to have to pick up another extracurricular activity that is provided by the school, they may become overwhelmed with trying to manage their busy schedules. Then, all of the positive attributes of physical activities fall apart. This reason is why the decision of the principal should be changed so that only students who do not participate in any extracurricular activity of any kind will be required to take one. Otherwise, there will be drawbacks to the principal's otherwise good intentions.

In conclusion, the decision of the principal, while beneficial to the students, shouild be slightly changed so that students who already partcipate in an extracurricular activity outside of school will not be required to take one provided by the school. Extracurricular activities are beneficial to students because they improve performance in the classroom, help them pursue higher education, and improve their physical and mental health overall. Students should be given every opportunity to succeed, but requiring every student to participate in a school-based extracurricular activity would not be fair to the students who do so outside of school. They may experience certain drawbacks as a result of the tremendous workload forced upon them, and this may also lead to weakened mental health. For this reason, the principal's decision should be changed such that it only applies to students who do not partcipate in extracurricular activites of any kind.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
7F438CA11201,"The principal suggests that all students must do at least one extracurricular activity during the school year. He wants all students to do something instead of wasting their time doing pointless things or even nothing at all. I agree with him that students should at least do one activity so they arent wasting their time on something that doesn't matter.

If this rule were to take action,students could possibly find something that they like or even love to do,whether it be sewing,running,singing,etc. It could even be their new passion for them to do at school,home,or somewhere else. This could cause the student to get out more because of this passion or passions,they could share their ideas with people who don't know much about the activity, but want to take part in it with the student or other people. Some students see some activities and find them to seem fun,but when actually participating in the activity, their thoughts and feelings towards it have changed. This is why students would most likely be able to switch their activity to something else that they think they'd enjoy more, letting them experience something better and more fun instead of keeping them somewhere doing something that they don't like.

While the students would be part-taking in these activities,they could possibly meet new friends for them to spend their time with later on and even during the activity. The new friends the students meet along the way could enjoy the activity with them and sometimes they may even help the student along the way with things they are scared or confused about. This could boost the student's happiness as well, because they now know that they are no longer alone. The parents of the students would most likely be happy about their child is participating in something and is also making friends. The parents would also be very proud and happy that their child isn't just sitting around doing nothing. Since the parents were always busy with their child home,they would now have some alone time and relax knowing their student is participating in other things out of the house.

Some students hold onto things that they like or love a lot,so most of the students who really enjoy their activity could possibly bring it with them as they got older. This could mean the students could make a career out of these activities if they were good enough at doing them,they could even go as far as showing these activities to their kin and teaching them how to do it. They could even get their kin to continue what the students had started when they are gone. Some students wouldn't be able to do some of these activities due to financial problems or just time itself, so they would be able to do it at school and maybe continue it outside of school if they ever had the opportunity. The school could even give the student a few things to continue it outside of school,raising the students' happiness.

In all reality,majority of the students would be be happy,considering that they now have something fun for them to do. These activities may seem small to them or anyone at first,but they could really change the students life for the better.

So in conclusion,I agree with the principal that students should start doing extracurricular activities,because it can change the students' lives or possibly just make it better if they are going through stressful or hard times.

I think that extracurricular activities should be put in schools because students can learn new things, it can help with their communicating skills, and can improve their self esteem. Joining extracurricular activities can be a fun way to help out the school, and have something to do after school such as sports, and programs that can be a great way to spend your time. People can look for activities that suit their personality and will the most enjoyable for them to participate in through out the school year. Participating in after school programs and sports can be great way to develop new skills , it can help you out with school work or, it can keep you healthy and fit.

Firstly, extracurricular activities can help improve your self esteem. Studies have shown that extracurricular activities can make you feel good about your self by knowing how to do something you are dedicated to or, you can be learning or improving in something you would like to know how to do. Furthermore, it can make you happy when you have reached your goals. Other students in your extracurricular activity can uplift you and help you focus and succeed in your goals, better yet, a great way to meet new people and make friends. It can help your self esteem by realizing you can do anything you put your mind to if you try hard enough, and to never give up on what you love. Also, Extracurricular activities will not only boost your self esteem about yourself, but, boost your self esteem with communicating with other people and to be more open to others around you.

Secondly, extracurricular activities can help students with learning new things. You can learn new things by participating in activities you have never did before and have no experience on, by trying new things you can find out what you enjoy doing. Extracurricular activities can also help others learn about each other and their interests on the activity they chose, it can form friendships and bring their group or team together. It can help students to develop more techniques to achieve skills in their activities to become better. Specifically in sports, you need good coronation, so to improve, they practice by using techniques to increase more skills to become a better athlete.

Thirdly, extracurricular activities can improve communicating skills and develop great friendship with others. Communicating is a huge part in learning and when you learn new things you might be unfamiliar with words and terms others are using, so its important to communicate to understand whats going on. When communicating, not only does it help you, but it helps the people around you know how you feel and what you think. Communicating in partner work can help you understand things better because you might not understand someone else perspective more than the other. In extracurricular activities you use communicating skills to make a better teamwork and understand where each person is coming from.

Finally, I think that extracurricular activities should be a major part of school and has many benefit. Extracurricular activities gives students the opportunity to try and learn new things and, can help you learn and improve new skills to be more confident in what your interested in. Its a good way to make friends and form good partnership with the people around you. It can help you communicate and understand things better and can improve your grades. Overall, extracurricular activities can be fun and can help you not only in school, but, your daily life. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
B522B51842BB,"The principal should not require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity at school. Students have their own life outside of school and may enjoy doing other things that is not an extracurricular activity, so they would not want to partake in any of the clubs. They also have other commitments outside of school that they must make time for. Parents may also have a problem with driving their students to these activities or picking them up as they have work and other errands they must do as well.

One thing that people receive as they grow older is more responsibility, and more decisions are completely their own. This situation should also give the students the choice of whether they would enjoy participating in any extracurricular activity. As an eighth grader, I have been given many opportunities to decide my own path and do what I wanted to do. I would expect to receive the same option in this scenario as this would only affect me and the club I am joining. It would not affect the principal in any way. Other students will also expect the same. This is also when we start doing what we enjoy and would like to continue to do as a career. Instead of doing an extracurricular activity that they don't enjoy, students can give time to these activities and be better prepared for the future. As my dad likes to say, ""The opportunity to make your own decision is why we can operate on our own free will.""

Students have also made many commitments outside of school that they need to give time to. Some of these may not even be an option as an extracurricular activity. Others may have students who would rather work alone than with a group of people. They may also not be as comfortable doing something at school that they wouldn't have even hesitated to do in the comfort of their home. Some students will not bring some materials to school for fear of losing or breaking them. Those materials may be what makes the activity enjoyable. For example, many students love doing art and have many different pens and pencils just for that purpose. However, they would never bring them to school as the pens and pencils are very special to them. Other activities can not be done at school unless there is a room created specifically for that purpose. Cooking needs appliances that must be built into the room, it can not easily be moved. Many schools do not have a room that the students can access with these such appliances in them. These such obstacles are not easily overcome as they can be costly. Others are an unrealistic goal.

Another problem is that parents or guardians may not be able to pick the students up. They have their own busy schedules that may not align with the activity's schedule. The student may chose another option, but they may not enjoy it as much. Someone who does not enjoy their activity will not put in as much effort as they would of if they did. These activities also will not all end at the same time as they need different amounts of time to accomplish their tasks. Thus, the school may not be able to provide transportation for all of the students. This is important as the students need to be able to go safely home. Ninety percent students here at Generic_School rely on their parents and the buses to get them home. Their houses are too far away for them to walk safely. However, Generic_School does not require its students to participate in an extracurricular activity, so schedules can be worked out and aligned. This lets all of the students get home safely.

Because of the reasons stated above, students should not be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. They should be able to carve their own path, meet their own commitments, and travel safely home. The principal does not have their viewpoint and, as such, should not force the students to do so.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
1A3F808C7AD9,"Extracurricular activities are very good for kids. I believe making students participate in different activities can be a benefit for them. Not only would it be good for the students but I believe it can make schools healthier and have a better environment. There are many activities students can choose from so every kid can do something to fit his or her interests. I agree with making kids participate in different activities because by making students participate in extracurricular activities then kids can build friendships and bonds with one another, students can learn how to work with a team, and students can stay active with certain activities.

First of all, if students have to do different school activities then it can help them build new friendships or bonds. If a student wants to go out of his or her comfort zone and try something new then they might meet new people. If a student wants to keep it the same and do something he or she is interested in then students can be around people that share the same interests. Making new friends is always good for kids, especially in school. If student were to make new friends I believe it can make school healthier for kids.

Second, I believe that if students participate in certain activities, then kids can learn to work with a team. Students that play sports, work with the yearbook club, and serve for student council all work with with team members and can learn how to work as a team. Learning how to work with a team is good for students because it will benefit towards them when they get a job. Working with a team can also teach kids to work with other people that they might not know. Good teamwork is very good for students and can benefit the school by making it a better place.

Lastly, I believe by participating in extracurricular activities then it can help kids be more active and healthy. Participating in sports is a great way for students to stay active and healthy. Track is a good sport that all kids can do because it is non contact, kids can be outside, and there are no tryouts. Being active can also keep kids nowadays from being to overweight, which is a problem that kids face because they don't get the daily exercise that is needed. Keeping kids active is very good for there bodies and it can keep kids healthy.

Participating in extracurricular school activities is great for students. By making kids participate in different activities can benefit towards the students and the school. If students were to participate in different activities they could create new clubs to fit the interests of him or herself and expand the activities in schools. I believe students should always participate in school activities whether it is forced or not because school activities can be very fun. In conclusion, I highly agree with the idea of making students participate in extracurricular activities because it can help kids build new friendships, teach kids how to work with a team, and help students stay active.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
02A3E737A10F,"Students shouldn't have to participate in one extracurricular activity or any

Students have other things to do at home. Many students have a lot of things to do at home and they're already busy with other things. Students have a lot of homework to do from different teachers. For an example students are given a lot of homework and have chores to do at home like cleaning clothes, taking care of their pets, cleaning the house or taking care of their siblings. Some students are already tired from school and might not want to participate in any other activity because they have to wake up early for school and have to do school work really early even though science say that the human brain starts working correctly when it's ten in the morning so that means the human brain of a middle school might not work so well at six or seven in the gosh darn morning. I disagree with the principal that every student must participate in an activity because not everyone is sporty, want to stay inside and do the yearbook or serve on the student council. Some kids just want to go home and relax a bit after doing work at school or some just want to play games to realest their stress of school. I think that students don't need to participate an any sort of activity that has to do with school because people want their minds off of school and not have to worry so much about it. Kids just wanna have fun out of school and don't want to do anything school related. Well most kids don't want anything to do with school once they get home. As I was saying before I got intruded by my brain bring up memes while writing this. I think that the principal should not decided that every single gosh darn student should do an extracurricular activity. Maybe everyone should take a nap for a few minutes...sorry! I'm very tired for some reason so anyways that's what I think about the principal's choice. Many students don't want to participate in activities. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
D17BD9575C96,"Friday March 10th, 2020 was another boring old, gross day for Generic_Name at school. All Generic_Name could think about that day was going home and playing Madden 20, and seeing the new golden ticket promo. When the bell rang in his 7th period class he new it was the end of the day and time for him to go home for the weekend , Generic_Name yelled ""Yes,

I can finally go home."" He yelled it so loud that the hole class turned around and looked at him like he was crazy. But when he was exiting the class his principle came on the over head speakers with a message "" Good after noon, all staff and students I have a special message for all students, this school year all of you will have to participate in an after school activity, for example you could play a sport or work on the year book. I hope you all have a good weekend and I will look forward to seeing you next week."" When Generic_Name got the news this he was mad, because he was not interested in any of the clubs or sports the school had to offer. So, he went to Principle Generic_Name's office to talk about the news, that he had got about the extracurricular activity. Generic_Name said to Generic_Name "" Hey, is there anyway that I could not do this activity"" Generic_Name said ""No"" Generic_Name said ""What if i give you some reasons that we should not have to do this activity?"" Generic_Name Said ""OK go on, I want to here them."" I disagree that students should have to participate in a extracurricular activities because they may not be interested in the activities, they may not have the money to pay for sporting equipment, and less time to spend with there family .

The first reason I disagree with students having to participate in extracurricular activities is because, they might not be interested in any of the activities. Some students at school like sports, that why school's have sports teams such as Basketball, Baseball, Football, and Soccer. These teams are optional and you have to tryout for them. School's also have robotics teams, Dance teams, and cheer teams. But some students at school have no friends at school ,and that is why they dont want to do these activities, because they dont know anyone there and they fell like they are going to get bullied for having no friends. But then some students are just not interested in the activities. That is why we should not make children do things that they dont want to do.

The second reason that I disagree with students having to participate in extracurricular activities is because, they might not have the money to pay for sports equipment. Playing a professional sport is every kids dream, some children are able to make it to the pro's when they are older but most of them stop playing the sport at a young age. The reason that these kids stop playing is because they can not support them self anymore for the equipment need or there parents cant afford to pay for the equipment anymore. That is one of the big reasons that children stop playing sports. The sport that this happens in the most is baseball because the equipment gets more expensive as you get older you need longer bats, bigger cleats, bigger gloves, bigger pants, Just bigger every. And you have to pay more money to play. That is why I think kids should not be forced to play a sport at school because of money issues.

The final reason that I disagree with students having to participate in extracurricular activities is because, the student would have less time to spend with there family. A lot of people like to spend time with there family, so If you were on one of the sports team you would have to go home two hours later every day because of practice. You would have less family time. And then you would have to go home and do home work, and all of the other stuff you have to take care of when you get home. The only chance you have to speed family is probably a family dinner. Most families like spending time together that is why people would not like if we had to do a extracurricular active because of less time to spend with your family.

""See Generic_Name don't think we should just be kids and not have to stay after school to do something we dont want to do"" Generic_Name said ''Yeah but we have all of these clubs and no one wants to do them that is why I made that announcement"" '' But you are right you guys are just kids we should not force you to do something that you dont want go do"" Generic_Name said. ""So on Monday when you guys come back to school I will make another announcement saying the clubs are optional you are not required to do one anymore"" Generic_Name said."" Thank you so much Generic_Name"" Generic_Name said.

CE17C1752FCF,"Did you know that only about 50% of students participate in extracurricular activities at their school? This includes sports, clubs, and tutoring. Many of the students still engage in activities, just not through a school program. I don't think it should be mandatory to participate in a school activity because it steals time away from homework, it could conflict with other activities, and going home after school to unwind is good for student's mental health.

Most of our activities last another hour and a half after school lets out. That leaves a lot less time for homework to be completed on time. I often find myself struggling to finish my assignments on days when I must stay after school or have prior obligations. Homework may not be a large amount of our grade now, but it will build up over time. If the principal issues mandatory after-school programs, a decrease in grades may be noticeable.

Another reason to not force students into clubs is that is may conflict with other things on student's agendas. Plenty of students do sports that are not offered at our school. If they were forced to do a school activity, those students would most likely have no choice but to to quit their true interest. Teachers are always pushing students to express themselves in all sorts of way. Making students engage a school program limits individuality by placing a restraint on what they can participate in after school.

School can be a stressful enviroment for students, much like work is for an adult. Returning home to relax, after completing homework, is a positive way to recharge mental batteries before the next day. Studies show that stress has a large impact on student behavior. Having to stay at school an extra hour and a half can really start to take affect on student performance. One of my favorite parts of the day is being able to breath in the calming air of home or just having my muscles release their tension after all the tests at school. Students already suffer through seven tense hours in the school building a day, why make them stay there any longer?

Someone may argue that school clubs can make students more social and help them stay active. While some students are social butterflies, other choose to have a more reserved life style or are active in their own ways. Rather than force something upon students, let them choose what they want to do. Tons of homework, long personal schedules, and common stress are all valid reasons not to have extracurricular activities be mandatory.         ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
B43F583ECE54,"Soccer, student council, and debate are all examples of extra curricular activities that will benefit students greatly in their future. You learn many life lessons while playing a sport, communicating with others, and debating. Being exposed to this type of activity from a young age will ensure your success in later years.

Playing a sport teaches you resilience, and how to work with a team. Loosing a sports game does not feel good but its something every one has experienced. Although not everyone knows how to handle losing. When you are taught from a young age how to be resilient and bounce back from a lose, it will be much easier to handle those losses as an adult. Playing a sport also requires team work, you have to work with your team to score a goal. Learning how to communicate with your team mates is very similar to communication in the work place.

Being on the student council is all about communicating with your peers. If this communicating is not done properly or clearly it will be very hard to get work done. When you get a job as an adult clear communication will be mandatory. If you do not communicate properly, someone could end up doing something differently then you intended. In student council, students will learn how to communicate with their peers. By doing this, communication as adults will be much easier. Even in disagreements your communication will be essential.

Debate teaches students how to argue respectfully while still getting your point across. You will encounter many arguments in your life so knowing a way to argue with out hurting anyone is a curtail life lesson. Arguments between friends, and families are very common, but these are people you love and always want by your side. Knowing how to argue kindly and not escalating to a fight is very important.

School offering a variety of mandatory extracurricular actives is a great idea. This way students can learn important life lessons while doing something they enjoy. These actives teach children important lessons from knowing how to handle losing, communication with others, and even how to respectfully settle an argument. Being exposed to this type of activity from a young age will ensure great success in later years of life.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

will you yes or what will think about that will you disagree or agree.

in opinion i will say no because the school might not have the right space to many people because some people like to play a lot of sports they want to be after school everyday so will we have the amount of space to hold to many student i think not because the students have to wait in the cafe we it's really small for then they can go to there activity will the the school fit the student in there activity what will happen if there no space to do this activity the always number one thing to remember is that we have to be careful with the student is sure so we want to have deceitful we the seem the space is big but is not if we tell the student the people that are staying after come to the cafe and there is a lot of people it's to get crowed in there there is going to be a lot of people and there is not gong to enough seat so every can seat there so if the principal come solution it will be great but i will still think it is not a good idea to have extracurricular activity this is my second reason why we should not have extracurricular for the student my second reason is that will student and teacher have the time to stay after school for there activity?

i think no because there 75% percent of the students in the school don't stay after school because they think they better stuff to do some they don't want to be in school no more so why make student participate in a least one exrecular activity and what if the the activity get full some the student will be like man i wish i was in the activity but is to full sometimes student don't get what they want that why they don;t stay after school because they think if soccer is full so i don't after they say if there is no in soccer available they don't stay after they want what they want. they don't want to force to take activity they want to be free and do what they like and about teacher some teacher will not have the time to help with the activity some are married and have kid they to care about there family or they have to somewhere else the teacher that are not marry they have other reponsibity out of school they have buy stuff of many have go do something that will benefit there student like get them some book to read or other stuff,but some of the teacher will say that i don't have the time but if pay me a little more i will stay so if they school does't want to go broke because of pay the teacher more to stay after school i think we should not recomed student to stay after school to do a extracurricular activity this is my second reason why we should not have to force student to taker extracurricular activity.

will the people that don't like to play sport will agree or disagree with the principal idea?

remember we need to think about other that don't like to play sport they like to play games,read book,or draw they like to do other stuff. they will not like to stay they will i want to lay games is want to be in a quiet place they want to be free from loud noises they dont want anything to disturb them they want to do something but quiet the disagree withe principal they will say i wanted to something quietly but these was so loud they like to do their stuff in a quiet place bu some,some hate spots but the are good a doing other stuff they like to do what they feel what is right for them self some student they arent do like them playing sport they tel they kid focus in education instead of playing sport they say that are spt are not going to feed they say if a good education that is going to do you we you are older some parents say if you become a soccer what are going to do we you retired what you going to do are going to be a dishwasher or what but if you get a good education when you're old you are going to have a job a good one that what parent tell kid do stay after school spots are not going to help this my third reason why i should think we should not extracurricular activity, now that i explain my reason why we should not have extracurricular activity, do you still argree or degree ?",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
0EA67D518E94,"Students should have a choice about their time after school. They shouldn't be forced to join a club that they possibly won't even enjoy. I disagree with the principal, because students might have siblings or other family that they need to take care of, lower income families might need their children to take jobs or watch their siblings, and students might not even enjoy the choices of activities.

First, students who have siblings or other family need time to watch their siblings and make sure their needs are taken care of. They might have sick or elderly family that need constant attention. Parents who work longer hours need the older and more mature to watch their younger. Parents who don't bring in enough money for a babysitter will depend on an older child to watch over the younger siblings, and a busy schedule won't help at all. If younger children get hurt because of these extracurricular activities, who will be to blame?

Another reason that extracurricular activities are a bad idea is that lower income families need their students to take part time jobs or watch their siblings, as stated in the last paragraph. Students who take jobs need time to actually do those jobs instead of getting sidetracked by meaningless activities. They will be needed by the family to provide for them, and these activities will do nothing for the family. Their parents will depend on them to stay afloat and keep everyone together, and if they're late for their jobs they could get fired, which would most likely be catastrophic for the family. Students from lower income families also most likely don't care as much about extracurricular activities as others do.

The last reason that extracurricular activities are a bad idea is that students might not enjoy the choices given to them, or the clubs that they want are completely full. Not all choice activities are fun or exciting, and sometimes students can get very bored and cause trouble. The choices for them might not be what they hoped for, or they could be disappointed by the reality of the club once they actually get in. The club they wanted the most might also be completely full, which would not only disappoint them, but leave them with a club that they most likely won't enjoy to its full potential. Forcing a student into a club that they don't enjoy is just cruel.

The principal forcing students to join clubs is not good, because the students might have siblings or weak/ elderly family they need to take care of and give constant attention to, lower income families might need their students during that time in order for them to do jobs or take care of siblings, and students might not enjoy any of the given choices of clubs. This principal needs to stop forcing students to do clubs when they most likely do not care about extracurricular activities.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

My principal has decided for all students would have to participate in one extrarricular activity. Say for example the student would have to go outside in have to play sport's. But they would go over the rules for every sport that they have out to play with. In for the year books you would be able to learn how to spell word's that you never new how to spell. The student's would also get a feel of how other student's our in they might even make a new freind's.

I agree because I think student's do not get enough exercise. If student's got enough exercise it would be more athleyt's. It would be more student's outside playing all types of sport's. They would be able to breath better than other poeple that do not like to exercise. In if student's do not get enough exercise they would not be able to leave a nice long life.

I think it is good for student's to exercise if all student's exercise they would leave a long healthy life. In if you leave a long life you be able to see the world in travel. But if you do not want to take care of your body you would not leave a long nice life. Like for example you would have to go threw alot to try to leave a healthy life. But if you do you would be able to complete your life long dream.

For the year books you would have to type poeple names. In the rason I think that is good is because the student's can get to laern new student's. The student's that our working on the year books can learn how too spell word's that they never even seen before. But you never know the student's can think the person that they saw in the year book is cool in want to be there freind.

So if i was you i would start exercising early so I can be haelty when im older. My princeipal has decided for all student's would have to participate in one extrourrieular activity. In if you do not participate in one of the extourrielur activity you would get in big trouble with the princeipal.

620DE3FDAA4F,"By the year 2020 , technology has become a standard in any home, therefor kids have been spending more time indoors playing games then outside, socializing with other people in person than by a screen. Yet there are some benefits to technology, communication ain't one of them. Most kids grow up unaware of how to act in front of older, even younger people in public because of the lack of communication wen they were young. but by supporting them in their younger years to join a after school club, they can learn new skills that can help them once they get older like how to communicate with others, embrace them self in clubs they are passionate about and make new friends along the way.

After school clubs are meant to be social, to interact with the people around you, and to help you relive stress from the prior school day. By going the an afterchool club, you gain confidence to talk to new people around you, loss that anxiety to talk to new people you never meet before and just become more socially active than before. clubs were made for this and by forcing kids to join them, they become more exited to come to school just because they know that after school ends they can go hang out with their friends at the afterschool club they decided to meet at. so by encouraging student to join clubs they become more social, but thats not all an aferschool club can provide to a student in school

Clubs offer valuable skills that can help students in the future in many ways. like fir an example, by joining a athletic club like soccer, kids can discover new talents they never knew they had until now, opens paths in their future to become something better like a professional soccer player, or a good hobbies to maintain because of the good exercise they can archive while playing the sport. Yet other clubs have different tasks in teaching students, like boy scout cub. boy scout provide many skills that become useful in the future, like going on a camping trip. learning to tie a knot become a necessity when camping, Yet dont know how to do it, but you it become second nature because of you taking boy scout in middle school. All clubs have benefits to children, by teaching them something new or by in bracing a natural talent they have. yet there is one thing that is more important than this.

Yes, clubs are meant to be educational and boost your confidence a little, but the real reason to join a club is to have fun!

having fun s great for your physical and emotional self esteem because when you have fun, you forget about all he stress you have accumulated and relax, enjoying the time time you have with friends, remembering all the friends you have me and reliving all that depression you once had because you were alone gone. by having fun in a athletic sport, you exercise having benefits i your emotional self and physical by reducing the chances of childhood obesity. After school clubs are meant to be fun extensions of your life, point in life where all the stress, disappointment and anxiety you have to go away, by spending time with other people in fun ways. Thats the meaning of a afterschool club, to have fun in it.

So,by indulging students to join an after school club, they can receive multiple benefits in there emotional and social life. giving them ways to relive stress than by vaping or taking prohibited drugs like cocaine or anything else. cubs give them opening inwich to relive themselves from stress in school or home. they provide ways to meet new new people that share those interests and a new way for them to learn new thing in life. Thats why i thinks schools should enforce students to join an afterschool club, so they can learn new thing in different ways.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
52315F217E9A,"If my principal had decided that

ALL

students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity for example students could participate in sports, work on the year book, or serve on the student council. I would strongly disagree because there is people like me that dont want to do sports and would just rather go straight home after along day of school or some could not physically do sports or stuff like that and lastly i think i will just make students mad so you will have a lot of students yelling and talking back and not doing what they are supposed to do.

I don't think you should be forced to play a sport or something like that because if you want to do it you will do it so there is no need to be force by principal. After school people just want to go home school is long enough so having an after school activity will just make some people upset and because I will be mad if i get forced to participate in an activity that will take time out of my day, and besides people have stuff to do also after school, some people dont have time for that.

Some students have disabilities so some of them won't be able to do that stuff and they have to go straight home after school. i'm just saying if the principal does that there will be a lot of complaints for example why do they have to do it and we have stuff to do this is not fare. If all the students will be forced to do something like that they will all be tired the next day because some people are just not used to it like me for example.

I dont think it is wrong sports are very good for you for example sports are good exercise and you could try something new, and you could even learn that you like a sport, but if some one wants to do an activity or play sports they can do it on there own they dont have to be forced for that stuff if you want to do it you will do it if you dont you shouldn't be forced that just going to make the students mad and aggressive. That should be something you supposed to do on your own.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
94EFDD45CDD8,"I disagree with the principal's decision to force the students to participate in extracurricular activities. The school can't please everyone with their clubs and some people will be mad about it such as: students, parents, and the teachers. Secondly, a lot of students are not comfortable with being in a groups of people. Finally, the students may not believe that clubs will help them with anything that they want to do in the future. They're many different ways to help get the students out of their comfort zones than trying to force them to do something they dont want to do.

First, no matter how hard you try there will always be somebody that will not be be please with the principal's decision. There is always gonna be that kid that will not want to apply to any of the clubs or teams because they doesn't find them interesting or they just dont want to do it. This decision can also make the parents and teachers very mad because this is messing with their schedule. Parents can be late for their night shift if their child is at a meeting for a club and the teacher will have to be looking after the kids while they are doing the meetings and that can cause them to loose time with their families. But, lets say the staff thought of all this and they are going to provide the students with all the clubs they want. There will still be problems because that means there will have to be more money spent on the clubs and teams that the school probably wont have.

Secondly, many people dont want to do something new because they are scared of the things that they will be exposed to socially. Many students are very awkward when it comes to social encounters. This can cause them to feel like they are being judged and that they are unwanted in that club. Even worse a bully may come about and pick on that student causing them to feel afraid and potentially making their anxiety worse. But, they can't do anything about it because they have to be in that club.

Finally, a lot of clubs won't help students accomplish what they want to accomplish in life. Unless the students want to be an athlete clubs or teams wont help you get the job that you want. Even though these clubs can help you get into a good college, which is important, it won't help the students with their people skills or how to be a better person. They will be in that team or club for one purpose and that purpose is what the club was made for.

In conclusion, even though you can benefit from this decision the smarter move is to let the students do what the want to do when it comes to extracurricular activities. No matter how flexible you try to make for everybody there will always be someone who will be mad with that decision. The school should just avoid the hassle and let the kids do what they want to do so everybody can stay happy.

BB86D8B194BD,"Principals make a lot of decisions on how to make sure their students give or get a good impression in life, so they could further their career in what they want to study or major in. Therefore, it was a decision made by our principal that all the of students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For example, a cooking club or a athletic sport or anything that your interested in that you do on the daily. Finding a after school activity isnt hard as you think it could be when you think about it. After school activities are just clubs or sports that are things you in enjoy doing in your free time. Students involving them self in a after school activity could be great a decision because it gives a good look on your college application, help students find out what their interested in, and challenge's students to learn how to manage grades and an extracurricular activity.

When your applying for college applications, you want to have at least one or two extracurricular activities. Especially, if your applying to a very high standard school, like Harvard or Yale. However, if you put those academic activities on your application you could most likely get in to the school that your applying for. Most of the colleges now a days look for people who have good grades and a great minimum of extracurricular activities because they want to see if the person isnt all about grades and can do other activities at the same time. Also, they look to see if you have anything that relates to their major or study. As a result, if you do those after school activities it can be helpful in your college application part.

Having to pick out a after school activity can be stressful when dont have a any hobbies or even know what your interested in. However, picking out a activity can exactly be easy because its something that you enjoy doing on a daily bases. When you pick out a academic club or sport and enjoy that activity it helps whether or not thats what you could be or major in life. For example, you take a cooking class and you enjoy everything about the club, so you might feel like you want to have career in cooking and be a chief. Lastly, taking an after school activity can help you find out what you might want to be in the future.

Being organize in school can be a challenge when your trying to balance grades and after school activities. Likewise, its an advantage because it shows you how to practice your organization skills. Also, keeps up the pressure of balancing both at the same time. Especially, when you have to keep up your grades to participate in the club or sport your in for school. However, it can help you because it makes sure that you can pass all your classes and go on to the next grade or even graduate. This is what colleges like to see because they see that you can take on anything that they throw at you and that your a multitask er.

Students involving themselves in a extracurricular activity is a great decisions because it gives a good look on a college application, helps students find out what their interest are, and challenges students with its grades and after school activity. Helps students get into their dream college for their future life to become successful. When students can find out what their interest is, so they can turn the into a hobbies and have a career off of it. Shows students on how to manage grades and after school activities, keep up the organization skills. Those advantages can be why you should agree the principal on that every students need to participate in one extracurricular activity.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
387A6ABAC720,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

For example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

I don't think it's fair for students.

I disagree with this because students shouldn't be forced to do anything they don't want to do, they might not have transportation, and they might lack interest in whatever they're doing.

One reason I disagree with this is because students shouldn't be forced to participate in any extracurricular activity.

When you are forced to do something you don't want to do, it can take up your free time.

For example, if I wanted to go home and sleep or play video games I wouldn't be able to because i would have to participate in my after school activity.

This could also take away time you could've spent with family.

For example, if you and your family were supposed to go out to eat when you got out of school, they would have to wait for you to finish whatever activity you are doing in school.

Another reason I disagree with this is because students might not have transportation.

If you are participating in an activity after school, you're going to need some type of tansportation to get back home.

For example, basketball practice is over and you have no ride, you would have to walk home or try to catch a ride with a teammate.

This could be dangerous because you're not always going to catch a ride, and one day you'll have to walk.

Walking anywhere could be dangerous because you will have to be alert at all times because you never know who could be following you.

Lastly, I disagree with this because students might lack interest in what they are doing.

When a student lacks interest in something it is usually taken lightly by them.

There is no reason to force a student to do something they don't have interest in.

If you force a student to do something they have zero interest in, they might try to rebel by not participating.

Therefore, they are just taking up space in a classroom, gym, ect.

In conclusion i disagree with this because students might lack interest, shouldn't be forced to do anything they don't want to do, and they might not have transportation. If you dont have transportation you won't be able to get to and from your activity.

If you are forced to do something you don't want to, it takes up time.

When you lack interest you are taking up space wherever you are,",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
A8D9AE4B4259,"Imagine this routine. Wake up, go to school, come home, do homework, go to bed, repeat. Sounds boring right? But somewhere between those steps, imagine doing an activity that you love. Makes it a lot more fun doesn't it? I believe that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because it helps them try new things, I am also in an extracurricular activity, and it allows people to focus on something besides schoolwork.

My first reason is that being involved in an extracurricular activity allows students to try new things. It's hard to try a new thing because it's scary to get out of your comfort zone. But very soon, it can become enjoyable and fun. Meeting new people is always a great thing to do in an activity. The students will get new friends and it will let them have someone to do the activity with. In activities, a lot of people come in not knowing that they may be good at it. Participating in activities can help someone find their ""thing"". Extracurricular activities let students try new things that help them find out whether or not they like it.

Another reason is that I am involved in dance and it has really helped me become a more diverse person. I have been dancing since I was three years old and I only did ballet back then but as I got older I started more styles such as tap, jazz, lyrical, musical theatre, contemporary, and I still do ballet. Doing all of those styles has made me a versatile dancer. On average I dance about 14 hours a week and it's incredibly tiring but it's also my passion and I love it. I wouldn't want to be doing anything else. Dancing has made me branch out, make new friends, and do what I love. Doing this activity has helped me figure out what I want to be doing forever. Being involved in dance has let me find out my passion and allowed me to become a stronger person.

My third and final reason is that extracurricular activities allow students to focus on something besides schoolwork. A lot of people just go to school, come home, do homework, and then just sit around doing nothing. It's get boring but activities let students do something fun. Schoolwork can become stressful if that's all that someone does. Sometimes focusing on something else can help take their mind off of it. Extracurricular activities can be relaxing. For example, some people do yoga or paint to forget about their stress. Those things can help people not stress as much. Activities allow kids to work on something non-school related.

After all of these reasons it's clear that out of school activities are great for students because it helps them try new things, I am in an activity and I love it, and it allows kids to do something besides schoolwork. I think that all students should do an extracurricular activity that they love.           ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
EBAA812BF6F7,"If my principal were to instate mandatory extracurricular activities then I would probably agree with their decision. There are a verity of extracurricular activities to participate in, so there is definitely something for everybody. Extracurricular activities are also a great way to meet people and make life-long friends. Furthermore, having extracurricular activities at a school can benefit the school in many ways. all in all, extracurricular activities are an important thing to have in schools.

There are many kinds of extracurricular activities. If one were interested in athletics, then they have the opportunity to try out for their school's sports teams. If they were interested in academics or needed help with their studies then homework club, science club, and other clubs of similar nature are all good options. If the student so chose they could participate in the musical, an art club, a coding club, a computer making club, a jewelry making club or any number of different activities all geared toward a different kind of student. This variety makes it so an extracurricular so suit anybody is easy to find.

Another benefit to extracurricular activities is their ability to help friendships. Going to a new activity allows you to meet new people with interests similar to your own. There is also the option of going to a club with somebody you are already friends with, drawing your friendship closer. I know that from a personal perspective I have made many friends, and even a few best friends, with the help of extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are a good way to make friends.

On top of all that there is the simple, abject benefits that extracurricular activities have upon your school. Yearbook is a program that helps the school, and is also an extracurricular activity. The school newspaper, student council, Eco club and many similar activities also have benefits for the school. Clubs and activities also boost moral and help students associate school with excitement and fun. The benefits of these activities affect everyone and so rules that help participation in these activities should be encouraged.

If my principal were to instate a rule regaurding a mandatory participation in extracurricular activities I would support it. Due to the fact that extracurriculars benefit everyone, their school, and their friendships, this rule would be a good plan. Extracurricular activities are an important thing to have in schools.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
E5B6F3AAA311,"If you found out that your school had a club in your interest, would you join it? My school has lots of clubs, sports teams, and many more extracurricular activities. Most likely your school has a club or sport team that would fit your hobby. There are many benefits of joining a club. Students will learn how to cooperate in groups, build responsibility and leadership, and will have bigger shots at getting a scholarship and prepare students for their life ahead of them.

Learning to work in groups is an important key in life. Going to college and getting into the work force is not an independent road. No matter what path you choose, you will always have to work in a group at some point. Many clubs at school help build team work. School sports help develop sportsmanship. Every game you play, you have to work as a team to win. Beta Club, helps develop team work too. You must work as a team to compete in competitions at conventions. Other random clubs like Spanish Club, can teach you to learn as a team. Like most people say,""Team work makes the dream work.""

Being in a school extracurricular activity, comes with responsibility and leadership. It could be turning in paper work or having to be somewhere at a certain time. Responsibility and leadership play a big role in life. Most clubs have some sort of leadership roles to take. Like the Student Council Association;You can become president or secretary. Leadership is not alone. Leadership comes with responsibility. School clubs help develop that in many ways: Being put in charge of a meeting, keeping up with paper work or club news, and more. If you can't take responsibility you have a high chance of struggling in life.

Yes, extracurricular activities are hard to do or may seem like a waste of time, but there are more benefits to it. School clubs can benefit you a lot in college and life to come. Some clubs offer college scholarships which can hep you a lot in college. If a college you are applying for sees that you are in any academic clubs, such as Beta Club they might offer a scholarship. If you are on a sport team, and you play very well colleges or universities will want you to play for and give you a scholarship. If you are interested in going to college, scholarships are big boosters. The amount of stuff you will learn with being in a school activity will help you in the future;they will prepare you for what to come in adulthood.

Clubs can really make a difference in your life. Theres too much to miss without being in a club. I highly recommend joining a club. They can help you learn how to cooperate as a team, build leadership and responsibility, and prepare you for life ahead. So go join a sports team or any other club. Get more involved; trust me you will have fun and it will really help you later in life.                ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
BFECDA379805,"My principal has just made an incredibly bold move, something that has never been done before in my school's history. Starting now, all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Many students are mad, many don't care, and few are supportive. It does seem unfair for the school to decide your life outside of school, doesn't it? Well, although it does seem controlling for the school to do this, I think the positives outweigh the negatives. I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help a student's resume in the future, help students make friends, and help students find their passions.

Starting off, I believe that participating in a extracurricular activity can help a student's resume. When you apply for your first couple of jobs, the employers do want to see you are doing well in school, but also want to know what you are doing outside of school. The activities someone does in their free time can really show a business the person's character. If employers see that the person was on a sports team or in a music group, they know they are good with working with others. If an employer sees the person was on the student council, they know they are a good leader. If they do volunteer work, employers know that the person is kind, and will always be willing to help someone out. All of these traits are great to have when working, and will make it more likely that you are hired.

The second reason I think students should do an extracurricular activity is because it can help them make friends. A lot of students in middle school deal with the issue of being left out. Either their friends from elementary school have moved away, or they have drifted apart over the years. Whatever the case is, having no friends makes it hard for you to get to know people. Normally, these students are viewed as outsiders, and a lot of people try to avoid talking or interacting with them. However, there is a solution, just not an easy one for someone that doesn't normally talk with other people. Joining an extracurricular activity can help students meet new friends. People in their group or team might be more willing to be friends, since they know the student better now from playing with them or working with them. Plus, everyone has something in common. To sum it up, extracurricular activities can help lonelier students meet new people and make friends.

The last reason I think students should do an extracurricular activity is because it can help people find their passions. I believe everyone has a passion, but it is difficult for people to find their's. However, being forced to try a new activity such as a musical instrument or sports can help someone find what they truly enjoy, and I have a real life example to prove it. When I was younger I used to try all sorts of sports, baseball, soccer, basketball, etc. They were all alright, but none were ever really exciting for me. Then, my parents signed me up for swimming, something I thought was ridiculous. If I didn't find sprinting down a field and dodging other kids exciting, how would I get through a summer of gliding in the water? Though interestingly, swimming turned out to be my passion. I do believe that the reason I liked swimming so much was because of how positive the environment was. In the other sports my teammates were very pressuring, and if I made a small mistake, I would be yelled at. However, swimming wasn't like that at all. I could swim great, alright, or horrible and my teammates would still congratulate me for trying my best and working hard. Though remember, I found my passion for swimming by being forced to try it. I believe that if I wasn't pushed out of that stage of defeat I was in, I still wouldn't have found out what I truly enjoyed doing. That is why I think being forced to do an extracurricular activity can help students find their passions.

To sum it all up, I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can show their positive traits to employers, help lonelier students find friends with similar interests, and push students to try something new and maybe find their passion. Leadership, kindness, and being social are all great traits that employers can see someone has, depending on what extracurricular activities they do. If a student who normally doesn't have any friends joins a team or group, they can find people with they same interests, and finally feel accepted. Lastly, if a student has given up on extracurricular activities because of a few bad experiences, they can be pushed outside of their comfort zone, and maybe finally find something they really enjoy. In conclusion, you are only a kid once and when it is all over, it's hard for you to join a sports team or music group as an adult. Doing these activities at a young age can help you find a hobby or a passion, maybe you will make some friends, and when you enter the real world, you'll have a resume that shows business's that you will work hard and make a great employee.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
714A13797698,"No means no. It is the universal term that everyone and anyone can understand by a shake of the head. Why would a principle, who is suppose to support and help their students grow, force them into something they might not want to do. This should be a voluntary act.

Some students might be uncomfortable with what the principle is asking them to do. They may not be athletic or the leader type to be in a school council or run in a student election such as a student president. Their families may not be open to the idea because of something going on at home like money, family problems, religion, etc. Or this student just may not like the idea because they may like to keep to themselves. To others it can be hard to put yourself out there in a environment you know nothing about. Parents might even have a problem with sending their child into a sport, when they fear of them getting hurt or trying to force them into something the student who just simply is not into. I remember going to my first soccer camp, it was only one day, but I was a very shy girl who was abnormally tall for a five year old and I didnt want to talk or play soccer in front of everyone because I was scared to feel embarrassed, I was still brand new to the sport so in the end I just stood there like a statue. I remembered that feeling and it was not a good one at all. Why should a multiple kids go through the same feeling if they really don't feel comfortable?

This really should be something the students get to decide. They need to be confident and comfortable in anything the students do in school, at home, outside of school, or wherever! If they are forced into it, they may become seriously upset. They may start to get bad grades until they fail. They may loose close friends and connections with their teachers. The school should really consider these options when thinking of the students. Think of their families. They may have other plans in their minds about where their child might want to go in the future and if they are doing something else that the school has brought upon the student, then the kids family just isnt happy with the school either. I truly do not think this is a good for the students growth and development either. And I'm sure that the kids attending the school and parents may agree with me on this one.

In the end, it truly is never okay to force anyone into anything. Including if it was for school, unless truly needed academically, but this time its not. This should be chosen by the student and the parents if they are willing to investing time, money, and effort into this. And if their kid said no, he or she means no and thats the end of it.       ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
BC58A9389AF4,"""I'm signing you up for science olympiad this year"", my mom said. I replied with,""No I don't want to"". I thought signing me up for science olmpiad was unreasonable because I already had such a busy scheldule. Nonetheless, my mom ended up signing me up anyways. I started with a stubborn mindset, but soon I began to really enjoy it. With this I saw for myself the positive effect of being well-rounded. In this prompt, we are asked about whether or not students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with this decsion for reasons including personal enjoyment, future success, and the opportunity to meet new people.

Firstly, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it might expose them to new things they would have never considered before. For example, my mom made my brothers sign up for chess. They were very hesitant at first, but by the end of the session they were devasted that it was already over. If they had never tried it, then they would have never known that it was actually something they loved doing.

Secondly, participating in at least one activity can lead to success in the future. Working on skills earlier is always better than later. This is why school clubs and other extracurriculars are so great. It gives students the opportunity to work on their skills at a young age. Some clubs in particular can help you build your resume for college or other schools. One example is the National Honor Society. This club shows colleges that you work hard towards your grades and can maintain them well.

Lastly, joining an extracurricular activity can lead students to meet new people with the same passion. For example, joining any sports team is a wonderful way to meet and work with new people that you can become close to. This is evident in my own life when I joined a volleyball team. I met many new people and had a great time working with all of them.

I do understand though that having all students participate in at least one activity can be time consuming for some, especially ones with a heavy workload afterschool. Despite this opposing reason, I agree with the decision because of entertainment, success, and new people. In the near future, I hope that many more schools can implement similar decisions so that students everywhere can experience the same benefits. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
6DBF918B3AEA,"Should the principal force students to participate in one or more extracurricular activities?

Some students may have other activities to do after-school, and cannot find time for other activities.

Other students may think it is a great idea and have an astronomically amount of extra time to do extra-school activities.

There is no compensation for that because every student must participate in something, so for that reason, students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity, and there are several other reasons why.

Students have many other hobbies and don't have time to go to any of the extracurricular activities.

Other students have work, and cannot get time off, before or after school for the activities, which puts them at a huge disadvantage.

Many teenagers have all around season sports outside of school which provides no stable insurance of time with other activities.

Students may feel forced and not want to partake in any of the activities.

Students may feel an unwanted attitude and feeling from some extracurricular groups.

Students may have a grim the teacher of council of the group, because he is not good enough, or does not have enough experience.

The teachers may be negligent and not notice that one particular student is treating kids with more authority while the others kids are being submissive because they are not competent in sports, politics, etc..

Not every single student has a liking or interest to any of the extracurricular activities, and could quite possibly be interested in other activities.

Students may feel obliged and wanting to participate in activities, but are not going to because his/her friends don't want to dont want to indulge in that specific activity.

That may possibly discourage some students and could result in no participation at all.

Also, the student's parents may not allow participation in some particular activities because there might be a risk of getting injured in some sports, or their past experience with doing an activity that could prohibit participation in that activity.

Students could be stressed out from taking very difficult classes, and might just want to rest after facing conundrum questions on a science lab report, or calculus questions.

In conclusion, I do not agree or sanction with the principal's idea of having student's participate in one or more extracurricular activities.

With students having to do other things outside of school, they cannot make room for another extracurricular activity.

Also, students may feel unwanted because of the lack of experience they might have from the activity that they're doing just to tag along with his/her friends.

Overall, the idea of forcing students into an activity that they might not want to do, is very bad and may force the students into a bad attitude or bad habit.

To just let students choose what they want to is the best for them, instead of making students do what they don't want to.     ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
7BE6E9F93FE2,"So, the principle said that we have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity and if you think about it, it's actually not a bad idea. You see, a lot of us are already doing extracurricular activities such as football or SCA. Now if your not doing an extracurricular activity or never have, it may seem difficult but just think of all the opportunities that can come with doing one. You can find new interests of yours that you might have never even thought about doing, you can make new friends and find people that are also interested in what you are interested in, and you can overall just be more active whether its playing a sport or just not sitting at home all day wasting time. I agree with the principles decision to have all students to participate in at least one extra curricular activity.

If you have no idea in what you would like to do, then your going to have to do some searching. Think of things you enjoy like if you enjoy playing a certain sport or if you like riding a bike. If your not into that sorta thing, than maybe look into stuff like Student Council Association or National Honers Society. In those,activities you can help the school and help your community. Maybe you'll find out new things and interests that you had never thought of ever pursuing in. They'll help you in and out of school and keep you focused on good things.

When you start these activities, you'll meet new people. You'll meet people that are also interested in the activities that your interested in. Lets say you play basketball, you'll meet new teammates or if you join a club, you'll meet others in that club. I love playing basketball so I am on a team. I also love helping my school and others so I also joined the NJHS ""National Juniors Honers Society"". Since I joined these activities, I met so many people that I never would have if I didn't take the step to start something new. So if you want to meet new people, starting a new activity is a great way in doing so.

Doing all these things make you more active like when you start a sport, you'll be more physically active or when you join a club, you'll be more socially active.

Doing any of these things is making you more active which is good for you and your personality. Being more active will make you feel good physically and about yourself as a person. Being more active is good so you don't just stay at home all day wasting your time playing video games or doing nothing. The energy you give off to people will be different and different in a good way. If you give off good energy, people will also start giving out better energy and everyone will feel better.

So all these things can happen just from joining an extracurricular activity. Just by you making a small change can trigger an effect that makes you and everyone around you feel better. You'll make new friends and you'll find new interests. You'll be more active in and out of school and wont have to worry about being bored when you get home. You can always start something new and exciting and that is whats great about this idea. I think that the principles decision for everyone to start an extracurricular activity is a great idea and I think we should all support it.                                                                                                                                        ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
AAE2C403989D,"Would you want to be forced to spend extra time at school? In my opinion you should not have to be forced into an extra activity because people have things to do after school. Also they already spend 7 or 8 hours at school and should not have extra time. Adding to that people need a break from school to be refreshed the next day because school is stressful.

Students should not be forced to attend after school activities adding to their day because some students have activities after school like music lessons. Students come home from a long day of school and have homework to do and should not have an after school activity because that will give them less time for homework. Also some students have a job and an after school activity can effect them financially. Also some students for me as an example have music lessons after school and that cannot happen if there is an added activity to my schedule.

Students already spend 7 or 8 hours at school and should not have to spend extra time. Students need a break because school can be stressful and with an extra activity you could be with someone you dont like or just want to be home and the activity will delay that. Being at home you can also feel independent because at school you have to ask to get water or use the bathroom and at home you can anything whenever you want and spending 8 hours of having to ask to get water or use the bathroom can really be a pain and being at an extra activity can lengthen that.

Students need a break from school because school is hard. School is a stressful place and the longer the break from it the better the next day will be. Also tests can be stressful and to do good on that test you need to be free minded and be refreshed and you can do that by not going to an extra activity. Also people at school can be stressful, for example if there is someone at school bullying you being home away from them can make you feel safe.

Having to be forced to and extra school activity should not be permitted because students have things after school, Also they are already at school for 7 or 8 hours and need a break, and adding to that students just need a break. The brain works better on a clear mind and having an after school activity can lessen that.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
B0E17505BCB3,"Do you know any of your friends that are active in sports or any other after-school events? Chances are, most students likely participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it's a sport, club, instrument, or an extra-credit elective for school. However, there are still quite a few pupils who remain idle in such opportunities when given the chance by their guardians or teachers; this may be because they believe that it will only take away their time. I believe that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because it can help them expand their social circle, improve overall work quality, and look appealing when submitting resumes to applicators in a specific school or occupation.

To start, it gives the opportunity to expand the student's social circle by having them work and communicate with others. For example, if a pupil is struggling to socialize with other classmates, they can find an after-school activity that will allow them to interact with people with the same interests as them. That way, it is easier to find something to relate with, and can even create lifelong relationships from thereon. In my personal experience, joining orchestra has done countless of positive factors in my social life; I have created very good friendships that I would've never made if I hadn't joined the orchestra, even with people that I would've never imagined becoming friends if it weren't for our shared interest.

Secondly, it improves overall work quality in school because outside knowledge gained from these activities can be applied and comprehended into schoolwork.

Although it may seem like extracurricular activities will not help in school, there will always be at least one characteristic that positively correlates with the work you perform in class. In fact, studies have shown that students who participate in at least one after-school event typically perform significantly higher than those who do not, particularly in subjects that they previously struggled in. In addition, when I first started Tae Kwon Do, I was a very unfocused pupil in my class and had trouble with discipline and time management skills. But as a result from consistently taking the classes every week, my work ethics and discipline improved significantly due to the constant drilling I went through.

Finally, the events you participate in can give off an exceptional impression when applying for a certain school or job. In order for you to stand out among others, especially when applying for more rigorous universities, the activities you take outside of class are the main characteristics of your resume that people look at. They look for factors that set you aside from other applicants, knowing that you put in the extra effort to excel in your classes and hobbies; otherwise, you are merely another out of a thousand candidates that happened to take a few honors courses. This is why such activities are extremely vital not only for personal preferences but for academical purposes.

In short, extracurricular activities should indeed be required for all these reasons. Many students may oppose against this belief due to the lingering thought that it may take away their free time or they are simply afraid of meeting new people in a new environment. However, it is important to keep in mind that although they may think that is the case, it will most definitely benefit them in the future, especially when college comes near. If students took the time to find an extracurricular activity that they are interested in, then they will see more positive than negative outcomes in their daily and social lives. In the end, it's up to them to decide for themselves, but they must know that their future counts more than their personal wants. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
E1AE7FDD072F,"Should students participate in extracurricular activities? There are many diffrenet activities for students, not only sports, but clubs and many more. There is other to life then school and activities. Students should have the ability to choose what they want to do in the extra time they have. Schools already take half of the students time with going to school and homework .I disagree that students must have an extracurricular activity because they could learn a new language, do better in school, and spend time with family and friends.

First, students can learn another language besides their own. First, the language that they pick helps them with their applecation to colloge and in the real word. For example, it is more likely for a student that have two or three languages to be accepted in a colloge, unlike the student that only knows one. Second, students could communicate with others around the world. For example, if they learned Spanish, they can talk to others in Spain or around other that speak the same language. Third, they could be the only one that learned that language in your class or school. In conclusion, these were the advantges of learning a new language.

Second, teenagers that are struggling in school could take their time and have an advantage to be better in school. First, they could study for their coming exams and be able to focus on them. For example, students could make study groups or study buddies for studying better. Second, after school students can get extra help from their teachers. For example, they would only focus on the students weak part on the subject. Third, they could make up for the extra work they missed from their classes. For example, a student is sick or had a docters appointment they could make up that work at home after school. In conclusion, students would do better in school with the extra time they have.

Third, we need to spend time with family and friends. First, help your family with work around the house. For example, help your mom cook for dinner,or help your dad fix his computer,or help your siblings with homework. Second, you could hang out with your old friends. For example, go to mall,watch a movie ,or go to their house. Third, get to know eachother better. For example, play Never Have I Ever, Truth or Dare,and many more fun games you could play. In conclusion, spending more time with family and friends could grow you a stronger relashionship.

In conclusion, I disagree that students have to have an activity because students can learn a language, have better outcomes on their report cards, and have quality time with friends and family. These were some reasons to not have an extracurricular activity. The principal should not force any student that do not want to do an activity make them. Students must have their own right to do what the want. Go stop extracurriculars!",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
899D394E518E,"This year my principal has decided that all students at my school have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The activities could be to work on the student council, help on the yearbook, participate in sports, and many other activities. Some students strongly disagree with his decision because they would rather go home and sleep or be alone. While other students are very excited about his decision. Would you be happy if you had to participate in at least one after school activity? I am very excited with his decision because I feel like this will help kids get into better shape, be able to hangout and meet new friends, do better in school, and help not put as much stress on their parents.

Even though you may not realize it, but participating in these activities help you be able to get into better shape. It helps the kids that don't do anything on their own start moving more, if they decide to do a sport. Participating in these activities also help you get into better shape because you will probably push yourself to be better than the rest of the students there. A couple years ago a students was overweight, but she started to participate in these activities and she is now in very impressive shape and a lot of people are jealous of her. Even if you don't do a sport you can get in better shape because you are doing more than what your body is used to.

Having to participate in at least one extracurricular activity would give you the opportunity to meet new people and to see some people you rarely get to see. While you are participating in the activity, it would be very easy to make new friends. You would be able to bond very quickly because you most likely have the same interests, considering you both are participating in the same activity. Maybe your best friend moved to a new school, and you only get to see her when you go to your activity. I personally think that activities are more enjoyable when you are able to work with or compete against someone that you know or met.

Studies have proven that kids that participate in extracurricular activities do better in school. While the kids that just go home and play video games or sleep do not do as well in school. Last year, a student that would go home everyday and just lay on bed texting people until midnight got very bad grades and the almost had to repeat seventh grade. Until, he joined a basketball club and all of his grades gracefully shot up. All the sudden, he was one of the smarter kids in his grade. The extracurricular activities help you with school because they not only take some stress off of school; but they also help you find people that you can help each other in school and they make you be able to sleep which refreshes your brain so you can think better in school.

Not only will the principal and students benefiting from this, but the parents will also. They won't have to deal with all the kids problems as much at home because the kids won't have it on their minds will be taken off of it by the distraction of other things by the time they get home. Parents and kids probably won't have as many arguments like they normally do. They also will have somewhere for the kids to go so the parents can get more things done. The parents will also enjoy their kids having better grades. They would also not have to help as much on school work because their kid would probably understand what the are doing in class better. So this decision will work to everyone's benefits.

Although not everyone is happy with the principals decision, he did the right thing. By participating in extra curricular activities it helps benefit everyone. It helps the students get into better shape, be able to meet and hangout with friends, do better in school, and not put as much stress on their parents. When people realize the benefits they will be very happy that he made this decision as well. The students will be amazed about how the activities turn out, and they will probably be much happier students. Overall, the principal made the right decision even though people are fighting against it.        ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
235437780D47,"I agree that all the students should have to do extracurricular activity. Everyone should do extracurricular activity because so the community/school can be people help and prepared for anything like playing sports . It also can keep people out of trouble or doing bad things.

Next,If you do it's helpful everyone would be prepared for anything like be fit . By you doing extracurricular activity it helps you with being active and fit. You can help out people if they need help.

Lastly, It can help a lot people with getting in trouble a lot .It keep you busy so you want get in trouble If you do extracurricular activity it's fun and keep you occupied .Everyone should do extracurricular activity so everything is good the community/schools are in good shape .

7B8984E700BD,"Have you ever considered the fact that not many schools have enough players on the soccer team or not enough people serving on different clubs? If schools tell students that they need to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, it could result in many benefits. I believe that students should be forced to participate at least one extracurricular activitie because it gives students hobbies, it allows students to improve their skills, and it keeps students healthy.

To begin with, extracurricular activities can give students hobbies they did not have before. Many students get bored from time to time. Whenever I get bored, for instance, I always turn to my phone. Whether it's playing games, watching videos, or texting someone, I use my phone to cure my boredom. If students were forced to be a part of any extracurricular activity, they would spend less time looking at a screen and spend more time learning new hobbies. Students would also be able to relieve stress from school. I know from experience that school work and tests can be extremely stressful and sometimes you need a break. Students who are given a hobby can also teach other students or family members what they know. If a student plays on the basketball team, then they can show their friends or siblings tricks and techniques that they learned.

Another reason I believe that students should take part in extracurricular activities is because it allows students to improve their skills. For example, working with others can improve students' communication skills. It also allows students to be able to talk to their peers and collaborate with others. Serving on the student council or playing a sport can make students responsible for something. Responsibility can be very important in the future. For instance, future jobs may want their workers to be responsible and set a good example to other people. If students improve their skills, not only would it benefit them, but it could also benefit others. To illustrate, if a student improves their soccer techniques and continues pursuing soccer, they can end up playing on a professional soccer team in the future.

Lastly, contributing in an extracurricular activity can keep students healthy. If students are playing a sport, they are keeping themselves active and in shape. Even if students are not playing a sport, they are keeping their minds off of schoolwork and other problems going on in their life by being focused on their activity. This helps students keep themselves mentally healthy. If students are kept healthy, their performance in school would significantly improve. They would pay more attention in class which could result in them doing better on tests and getting better grades.

Many schools need extra help. Either they don't have enough students on the soccer team or not enough people serving on different clubs. I believe that more schools should enforce students to either play a sport or join a club to solve the problem caused by lack of volunteers. Forcing students to take part in one extracurricular activity could lead to giving students a hobby, letting students work on their skills, and it keeps students mentally and physically healthy. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
E9A10ABAF3B6,"Children deserve their own free time. Making extracurricular activities mandatory for all students would not be a good choice. The students would become uninterested in school because they would not enjoy participating in activities that they are forced to do.

Students already have 7 hours of school and they would not enjoy more of it. They should have their own free time because the activities would not be enjoyable for them because they are forced to participate in the activites.

The students would not want to attend school because of the mandatory extracurricular activities and if they do not attend school they would become uneducated, causing them to be unsuccessful in their futures because they would not have education to get a degree in college, causing it to be difficult to get a good, well paying job.

The children would have less time to work on their school work if they were forced to do activities that they did not want to participate in. None of the activities involve working on school work or school assignments.

Making extracurricular activities mandatory is not a good choice. Children currently have 7 hours of school and they would not enjoy school being extended so it takes away their free time. Students would become uneducated as a result of mandatory activites. They would not continue attending school because of they would not find the activites enjoyable or entertaining, and the activities do not help students achieve academically.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
D291519003C4,"Students should not have to participate in an extra-curricular activity. It can cause a lot of problems with the student's schedules outside of school, it can counteract their parents schedules, and some students already have extra-curricular activities that aren't connected to the school. It's another unnecessary cause.

One reason I feel this way is because there are many people with busy schedules. They have programs they do after school and if not, they get time to spend with family and friends. Teachers do hand out homework as practice material for the things they learned that day. The majority of students who get homework, gets it done and turned in on time. But not only does it affect student's lives, it could affect the parents as well.

Parents are just as much affected as students would be with an additional extra-curricular added to their schedule. There are parents who are working in the morning, so the students get up, go to the bus, go to school, and then ride the bus home to wait on their parents. A lot of students whose parents don't get home until around 7 or 8 pm know how to make a lot of meals for themselves. If the school adds another mandatory extra-curricular activity to the mix, the students wouldn't get home until late because they can't drive. And the students who already have extra-curricular programs after school are going to have trouble getting there on time if they have to stay after school and do a mandatory activity. However, some seem to think they have the solution.

Some people say the simple solutions like, ""Just carpool"" or ""school should come first."" But if their teen knows a friend but they don't know that friend's parents, they aren't going to trust the friend's parents with their child. Moreover, trust them with dropping their kid off at the their home, when they are still at work. School should come first, but not for the parents. The parents already have jobs and are fully beyond school, unless they are taking online courses to get a degree. It's the students responsibilities to get homework done, to study for their tests and exams. So maybe, having a mandatory extra-curricular activity after school would be a bad idea.

Mandatory extra-curricular activities right after school can be stressful and can damage a schedule already set in place. It can place a lot of worry on the working parents, it can unbalance a student's life with so much to do, and it can really affect how students do in school. Sometimes it's just better to let good be good, and nothing else.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
6EB63DED80F4,"Time. Something that is infinite, but somehow everyone needs more of. In middle school especially, time takes a strange stance in a person's life. It seems as if you have all the time in the world before adult life, yet none at all. I believe that after-school activities can play a big role in peoples' middle school experience, however I disagree with making them mandatory. I disagree with required extracurricular activities because they take away free time from everyone involved, give people another obligation to fulfill, and cost the school extra money.

First, all activities take up time. When you require them, it is no longer a matter of ""if you have time,"" but now a matter of ""you need to have time."" Everyone has things to do in life other than being at school all the time. Whether it be parents, students, or teachers, this takes time away from everyone involved, and makes it so that they don't have time to participate in the things they are really passionate about outside of school. Not only this, but required after-school participation is basically just an extension of the school day. Students and school faculty are already at school for seven hours a day, and have work to complete at home. These two things combined can take up to ten hours out of a person's day, barely leaving time for meals and an adequate amount of sleep. By taking up even more time in a person's life with required after-school participation, you end up cutting into their daily needs, which can affect their day-to-day performance.

Second, getting everyone on board with mandtory after-school activities is going to be tough. The first problem that this raises is defiant students. Most students would rather be with their friends, playing video games, or having fun outside, than staying at school and being forced to participate in something they don't have any interest in. I find that lots of students will probably go ahead and do what they want, instead of following the rules and staying after school. The next problem with getting everyone involved would be parents. Though it may not seem like it, parents have a very busy life. Whether it's work or other engagements of their own, parents may not be able to make their personal schedules work along with mandatory extracurricular activities. The third and final problem that getting everyone involved has is teachers and faculty. Teachers, just like everybody else, have lives outside of school. Lots of teachers have very busy lives already, being parents or simply having other duties as well. Because of this, getting students, parents, and teachers alike to agree on required after-school activities will be nearly impossible, simply because there are too many people to take into account.

Last, extracurricular activities cost the school money. The first extra cost will be general building expenses, like heating, cooling, water, and electric. By more people being in the building for a longer period of time, there will be more rooms with lights on, more people using the bathrooms, and the heating/cooling system will have to run longer, making the school's bills go through the roof. Second, the school will have to provide transportation. Even after you get parents on board with required participation, they may not be able to pick up their child. With around seven hundred students, going to twenty different neighborhoods, you will need at least twenty-five buses, which could end up costing the school thousands over the course of a year. The final cost that comes along with extracurricular activities will be paying teachers. Since faculty will have to stay after hours, some could argue that what are required extracurricular activities for students are forced overtime hours for teachers. In this case, teachers would want compensation for their work, yet again costing the school more money.

All in all, requiring extracurricular activities is a bad idea. If the school wants a way for students to branch out and try new things, they could try instituting a school day solely for that purpose. We have a system called

Highlander Day at my school, where people can take anything from CPR training, to theater classes, to personal finance classes. I believe that this is a great alternative to mandatory after-school activities because it doesn't take away free time from anyone, it's easy to get everyone to participate, and it doesn't cost the school any extra money.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
2B94F21871FC,"participating in an extracurricular activity might be fun and interesting for some students but not for all of them.

because students have other interests and other activities that they enjoy doing. Not all students have enough time to participate in one of this activities. some students might not even be able to participate. this might be a good decision for students who enjoy doing this activity but to make it fair for all it shouldnt be a requirement. instead it should be optional. in that case students who actually wants to do one the activities can join and students who dont can find an activity to do which they enjoy doing.

according to studies students tend to be more successful when they do a activity that they enjoy especially when they pick the activity them self because students always pick activities that they know they will enjoy and will be successful in.

in conclusion, i disagree with the idea of requiring students to participate in one extracurricular activity because most of the student might not be successful doing an activity that they are required to do, students might want to do other activities instead of extracurricular activities and it might be better to make this a optional activity.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
8D1F74040579,"Do you think all students need to participate in extracurricular activities? Do you think that is fair to students who have other things they must complete? If you said

Yes to these questions, then you would agree with the principle who thinks that all students needs to participate in some kind of extracurricular activity. But, I think students do not need to participate in extracurricular activities if they do not want to.

First of all, Some students might have important things that they must complete. For example, Homework, Is something that all students deal with. Here is a scenario, say Generic_Name has a big science project on Newton's third law, he is almost done with it, it is due the next day, but he cannot finish it because he has to go to the student council meeting at 5:00 because his principle requires him to. What should he do? Another example is, Generic_Name is trying to finish his Geometry and Civics/Economics homework, which they are due tomorrow, but he has to go to the school basketball team practice this evening, and he cannot miss it. If students have to do these things, then they might not get things done on time. Do you still say yes to the two questions in the introduction?

Another reason could be, a student, of all the choices available, might not want to do anything because nothing sounds good to them. Like if a student was looking for something to do, and they don't find anything, then they may have to do something they don't want to. Say Generic_Name is trying to find something that he would enjoy, he does not find anything that he wants to do. So the school assigns him something, Soccer, but he does not like soccer and does not have fun doing it. How about now? Do you still think all students need to do extracurricular activities?

Have you ever considered the fact that some students might just want to stay home with their families? Or go somewhere on the weekends? Or just relax on the weekends? Well, if you still say yes to the two questions in the first paragraph/introduction, then consider the fact that some students come home after a long day at school, and they just want to relax, talk to their family about their day, or watch a movie, TV show, etc. Or on the weekends where they just want to stay home, visit their relatives/friends, or go somewhere, like museums, the store, or somewhere they will enjoy it. Here is another scenario, Generic_Name plays on the Baseball team, and there is a championship game coming up, he is very excited for it, and he cannot miss it unless he is sick. But Generic_Name and his family are going to the beach, something Generic_Name has been looking forward to, but the coach schedules the championship game the same day that his family is going to the beach. What should he do now? It's things like this that can interfere with family events that a student might look forward to. Now what do you think? After all the things I have just explained to you, do you still think extracurricular activities should still be required?

OK, if you still say YES to the first question, you might think this.

If you play a sport, wouldn't that be good exercise for you?

Yes, but a student could get great exercise at their house, If they go outside, then they could ride a bike, scooter, skateboard, etc. They could also get great exercise at school to, P.E. they run, play games, sports, etc. going outside and doing PE is a great way to get some exercise.

I think doing an extracurricular activity is something that students do not need to participate in if they do not want to. Do you STILL disagree with me after all that nonsense? I hope you do agree with me now. Anyway, extracurricular activities is something that the student should decide upon, not the principle. The student should be the one that decides that kind of thing.

For example, if someone was forced to come in to work on a day off, he or she may have to give up spending time with family. Being forced to do something is never a fun experience. Students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may not be interested, some may not have transportation, and students may begin to stress.

Students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may not be interested. Participating in clubs or groups are not for everybody. If a student does not desire to participate in an extracurricular activity, he or she should not have to. If the student is forced to, he or she may not do any work. For example, a student was forced to participate in an after school club. During the club, the student would talk out and misbehave. The student was disrespectful to the club leader and acted in a disorderly manner. When asked, the student replied, ""I was forced to be here."" If students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, a student may not do any work out of a lack of interest.

It should not be required for students to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may not have a means of transportation. This may happen because the student's parent could be busy. A lot of parents have to work late. They don't have suitable hours that will allow them to pick up or drop off their child at school. There have been countless times when students would stand outside waiting to be picked up from an after school activity. The students would stand outside for a long period of time. Standing outside without adult supervision can be dangerous for a student. A parent should not have to worry about getting his or her child home safely because the child was required to stay after school.

If a student is required to participate in an extracurricular activity, it may cause him or her to stress. Some extracurricular clubs and groups require students to conduct a lot of work outside the club or group. In situations like this, students tend to worry about completing all work for their part of the group. For instance, students have different levels of productivity. Some can balance out school work and extracurricular work while others are not able to. If a student does not have high productivity, this may cause him or her to stress about all the work. While trying to balance out all this work, the students grades may begin to drop. This can lead to even more stress than the student can handle. Schools should not require students to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may begin to stress.

Students should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may not be interested and may not have a means of transportation. A student may also have trouble balancing out extracurricular work and school work. Though at the end of the day, everyone has his or her own purpose in life. It may be to do big things or some may want to do small things. It is not fair to be forced to do something that an individual may not want to do.

As you look up from your lunch tray eyeing the cafeteria for an empty seat, wishing you had someone to sit with, everyone looks up at you like a pack of animals wondering where you'll lay your tray down. In that moment you wish you just had a couple friends to sit with, but you don't know how to start finding any? Joining a cub or extracurricular activity is the perfect way to do that! When you first decide you want to join a club it might be scary because you don't know anyone or which one to choose so you can fit in, but soon enough you could be meeting your closest friends. Whether it's sports, debate, or yearbook you have so many options to find the perfect club that is right for you or try something completely new.

When I was new to middle school, I didn't know many people because I had moved her from Florida the summer before seventh grade. I tried new ways to meet new people by sitting with a certain group of girls at lunch or being in their book club group for class, but none of those ideas worked. My last hope was to join a club! That was the best decision I could have made. There was so many options to choose from but I enjoyed photography and art which made me think to try the yearbook club. The first day there wasn't many people there which I most likely could have expected but I kept going every week. About three weeks in, more people showed up including the group of girls I wanted to be friends with! My heart skipped a beat! I was so happy to see them walk in the door and hopefully be able to get there attention so they would invite me to sit and work with them. After a few minutes of pretend coughing, one of the girls; Generic_Name came over to me and asked if I wanted to join them. It was in that moment I knew we were going to be friends. If I didn't persevere and keep going to the yearbook club meetings and put my venerable seventh grade self out there, I wouldn't have met the amazing group of girls that are now my best friends.

Trust me, I can understand how scary it can be to be the new kid trying to make friends, especially in middle school, but I am here to tell you that you just have to be brave and put yourself out there for people to get to know. That is why I think it's a great idea for everyone to have to join a club. Everyone is in the same boat as you, trying to fit in. Joining extracurricular activities can help with that and expand your understanding and liking of certain hobbies. For example, you could try the soccer club, then realize it's your favorite sport and you want to pursue that hobby.

In Middle School, students are getting ready for High School. They want to figure out what classes to take for 9th grade, but some students does not know what classes to take next year. The student can either pick a random class that might not be beneficial to them, or they can participate in extracurricular activities to find their interests before they even choose what classes to take in 9th grade.

When you were little, did your parents enroll you in random extracurricular clubs such as; Boy or girl scouts, just say no, or recycling? Our parents just wanted us to find clubs that interest us at a young age, so you could find what club or activity you might want to pursue in Middle School, or High School, and maybe even Collage.

In Middle School, if you are talented on a sport, you can tryout in High School, and if your good enough, you can make it on the team. You can get a scholarship that can save you thousands of dollars when your going to collage. Even if you don't make it on the team, you can practice more and tryout for the team next year, but if you don't want to take sports too seriously, you should still play because, you will gradually loose some weight.

Another extracurricular activity is staying after school. It can improve your grades, even if its just one letter grade up, it will make a difference. There are dozens of After School programs like; After school homework club, after school sports club, after school computer club, etc. In after school homework club, you can do your homework there, and if you have any questions, you can raise your hand and ask the teacher for any help that you may have.

Overall, the principal thought of a great idea where the students has to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It helps the students find what their talents, hobbies, and interests are. If the students participates in these activities, they will most likely have a higher grade than others who don't participate in extracurricular activities",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
36677FE57D6B,"I disagree with the principal because. Students have homework and doing activities can get them stressed about school. Also some students have to take care of there siblings. Sometimes something important happens and your not home because your doing after school activities.

Student have homework and doing after school activities. They dont have time to do home work and they an be failing a class. And failing a class can get you kicked out of the activity your in. And when your failing a classes you can get held back a grade and that will go in your record.

Some students have to take of there siblings. Because there parents are working and there is no one home to take care of them. Maybe your baby brother is choking on a toy and your not home to save the baby . Maybe your parents went on a business trip and they will not come back for a week there is no time for after school activities you have to cook for them take them to the park.

Maybe something important happened at you house and your not home. If your mom is a single mom and she has a medical condion and something happens to her. You are not home because you have after school activities. You had to go somewhere after school but you forgot and you go to you after school activities and you remember when you on the way home but you know its to late.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
017FB36B3B0C,"You just finished a long, hard day at school. You're exhausted, and you can barely keep your eyes open. However, your principle has required you to take an extracurricular activity, and you have to spend another hour at school. After school has ended, I just want to get home and lay in my comfy bed. It would be very irritating if I had to spend another stressful hour at school. I disagree to requiring all students to participate in at least one activity because students need to learn to act on their own interests, they may have a very busy life at home, and it adds unnecessary stress on the kids.

First, these young adults must learn to act on their own interests. It's a necessary life skill for people to go for what they find a liking to. People don't just wait for their hobbies to be required to do. When you become an adult, you have to make decisions for yourself. Next, when kids act on their own interests they become more engaged. Students are not gonna want to do an activity if it's something they didn't even want to do in the first place. When a kid signs up for an extracurricular themselves, it becomes way more enjoyable for them. Lastly, it makes them feel more responsible. When a teenager does what they want, they know that they asserted themselves in a way they wanted to. It's amazing for a kid to feel responsible because it will make them want to do more responsible actions in the future. So that is why students should educate themselves on acting on their own interests.

Second, these people may have too busy of a home life to do an extracurricular activity. These kids have a family at home, and it's unfair if we give them little time to spend time with them. The kids barely get to see them with the amount of time they spend at school without the extracurricular activity. It is important at this age for the teenagers to build strong bonds with their families. I value the bond I have with my family, but when I'm busy with school I never see them. Next, these kids won't have enough time to spend with their friends. You never know if their extracurricular activities has their friends in it, and if you forced them to join one, it's unlikely that they would. At these ages, the kids want to make memories and enjoy their youth. If we make them stay at school, it may be hard to do that. Lastly, these young adults may also have work outside of school. At this age, they want to get the experience of working. We'd be putting too much on their plates if we made them take an extracurricular activity. Overall, it'd be too hectic for the kids who have a lot to do at home to take an extracurricular activity.

Lastly, requiring them to take an extracurricular activity adds unnecessary stress on the students. For example, they have a ton of homework that they must complete. When you make them take an extracurricular activity, it takes away time for them to complete their schoolwork. In the end, we'd just be giving them a more jam-packed schedule. Next, we could be adding social stress on the students who don't want to take the extracurricular. Kids don't want to be put in an environment that makes them uncomfortable. I know what that feels like because I've been in many situations where I was in a social setting where the people made me very uncomfortable. Another example is, the teenagers will be getting less sleep. These students already don't get enough sleep as it is. Studies have shown that many teenagers don't get the preferred amount of sleep. When we force them to take an activity, we give them less time to do the things they need to do out of school. This will result in less time for sleep. That puts stress on them because when you lack sleep, it is hard to focus and makes it hard for them to pay attention in class. Therefore, we would be adding too much mental strain on the kids.

In conclusion, it is not an intelligent idea to force students to take an extracurricular because students have to assert themselves in things they want to be in, their home life may be too jam-packed, and it adds mental strain on the kids. If you're reading these, make sure to schedule your events so your day isn't too busy. You never know if your school board will make extracurricular activities required. Therefore, I stand by my opinions because after school I'm exhausted and tired. The only thing I want to do when I get home is rest in my bed.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
5B2B04C5E20C,"Have you ever wondered why some kid dont do some sports or running for class president? Well there are a lot of reasons and i will be explaining some of them in this essay.

One reason why i disagree with extracurricular activities is because some activities can interfere with your plan. For example if you and your family have to go and the activity is also that day if you have to go the plans your family made will be ruined.

My second reason why i disagree with extracurricular activities is because most activity put a lot of stress on the students. The students will not have anytime to wind down from school and start stress about school work. to much stress on someone can cause them to have a heart attack. Which weakens the heart which also weakens them.

My third reason is that there are some shy people that don't even like being around people. they like to stay independent and then if people talk to them they start to get mad.

So my conclusion, to should students have to do extracurricular activities i disagree because it can stress the student to much, they could have plans for something.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
8D507482923B,"Having extracurricular activities at school can be enjoyable for students but they shouldnt be forced to have to participate in them. Extracurricular activities should be a choice not a rule. Most kids have things they want or need to do after school and dont have time to participate in extra activities. Also keep in mind that students need to be able to spend time with their families and themselves. Students shouldnt have to participate in extracurricular activities because students may not have time, also students have other responsibilities than school, students should not have to participate in something that they dont want to do.

Students have things they want to do after they get out of school. If that student has to stay after school they will miss out on the things that they were interested in doing. School takes up the majority of a students day, so students should be able to have that freedom of having time to do the things that they want to do. A students life shouldnt just reflect on school, they should be able to go out and have fun and live their lives without having to worry about school all the time. Students also need to be able to have time to spend with their friends and family.

Students have other big responsibilities beside going to school. Some students may have to go home and take care of a younger sibling or some may have chores that they need to complete. A student may need to be at home at a certain time, extra activities could interfere with that. Students may have pets or other things they need to take care of when they get home. Also, students need time to be able to take care of themselves and practice personal hygiene.

Making it a rule for kids to have to participate in extra activities should not be allowed. Students should be able to participate in things if they want to, not if they have to. Especially, being forced to choose from things that may not fit your interests. Having to be involved with a certain activity can interfere with what students need to complete at home or anywhere else. Activities are supposed to be enjoyable, but they arent when you are required to do them.

In conclusion, activities are better when chosen and not required. Students need to have that kind of freedom where they can choose if they want to participate in something that takes up their time. Students should be able to leave school and have time to enjoy themselves without worrying about school. Students will try harder in activities that they enjoy, rather than what is forced. Students should be able to have a choice of what they want to put their time and energy into.                    ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
840BD934198B,"Do you really want to spend your day crammed in your house being bored and doing nothing? Well I don't. And because of that I believe that all students should participate in sports. You might be thinking ""Why should I,"" well you should because you become healthy, it brings new opportunitys, and a better mental health.

Sports can help you become healthy. One way you can become healthy is that you're constanly excersicing. You are running, lifting weights, stretching, and more. Another way is that you're outside. If you're outside it's better for you because you need sunlight and fresh air. The last way is that you're given a new group. It's healthy to be around different people then just school friends. If you can't find a way to be active well then try a sport because there are many sports to choose from.

You are given new opportunities through sports. What I mean by that is you can be given scholarships. If you end up being really good at a sport then you could try to get a scholarship for college. A second way you're given a new opportunity is new friends. Since you're surrounded by kids your age 2-3 times a week might as well become friends with them. Lastly, you're in a new enviorment which is good. It can be a nice change from your usual schedule. We all need new opportunities sometimes and it can't hurt to try them.

Your mental health can improve from doing sports. The first way mental health can improve is by running. When you're running your stress and anxiety goes away because you have a break from it. You can be put in a better mood. Studies show that being active improves your mood. The last way your mental health can improve is you get a better sleep. If you've been active all day then you're most likely going to be tired when you get home which can help you get a better sleep for school the next day. If you still think that sports sound boring then think about you and how you can improve as a person and fix your mental health through this.

In conclusion I believe that all students should participate in sports. You can become healthy and fit so you're ready for bikini season. Change is good so put yourself out there and do a sport it can't hurt to try. Become a better version of yourself and improve your mental health. For all these reasons I've given I believe kids should participate in sports.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A4BE98BB1E78,"I would disagree with making students do mandatory after school activities because it would get rid of the students little after school time, it is completely not normal, and is making most students do a activite that they dont like/ is bad.

Those are my reasons on why I think that having mandatory after school activities is bad. By making mandatory after school activities the principle would be very unpopular and no one would like him/her. In the following paragraphs I will break down each reason on why I think it would be an abomination if we had to do mandatory after school activities. So let me start explaining my first reason.

If we had mandatory after school activities it would take away our after school free time. What about the students that have outside of school activities like baseball, soccer, etc? Should we just expect them to drop their sports teams so that they can take some pictures for a year book no one cares about? Or what about family time outside of school? When my dad comes home I only see him for a hour or two before he takes three to four hour naps and after that he eats and go to sleep again. If I did after school activities I wouldnt be able to actually interact with him some days of the week because when he's awake I would be doing an after school activity. Also, the most important part is that it takes away from the students free time. We are at school for eight hours doing work we despise and they expect us to give away our free time for some unless mandatory after school activity that will never do good for us? I only have around three hours of free time and around one of the hours is spent doing homework. And that only leaves me with two hours to do the stuff that makes me happy, like play video games, talk to my friends,a quick nap, do some personal work. If I had to do mandatory after school activities I could do none of those stuff, thus making me a sad, over worked loser. That is completely not normal, with ties into my next point.

My next reason is that mandatory after school activities is completely not normal and all they are is forced work. They are making us stay after school to do work and activities that most students don't want to do. If we wanted to do an after school activities they would take one. We already need to do 900 hours of school every year, and if we had to stay for two days a week, one and a half hours a day, then it would add more than a hundred hours of time we dont want to spend at school. What we are doing more unless school work that is not even teaching us students anything useful. We could be learning or doing stuff that makes us happy but instead we will be doing activities that will never benefit us in the future. Basically no other schools do this and our schools would be that weird crazy outsider. We never done in the past and we dont need to start now.

My final reasoning on to why I think that we should have mandatory after school activities is because the activities at school suck. If all of eighth grade, around five hundred students had to take activities, then all the good ones would get filled. Only around 1/4 of after school activities are good and fun and the rest are garbage. Like right now, art, one of the better after school activities, gets filled sometimes. Now everyone will want to take it so all the other kids will be left with bad activities. Same with sports, the school isn't big enough to have even 1/4 of all boys try to play a sport like basket ball of football conditioning. And then what? Everyone else has to go to a bad club like K-POP club? The school just doesnt have the means to have all students go to a good after school activities. Thus leading to even more people hating the new rule of mandatory after school activities.

Those were my reasoning onto why I don't think we should have mandatory after school activities. Summed up it would get rid of our free time, it would be wrongful and basically forced labor, and it would suck for most students. These reasons are the exact reason why mandatory after school activities will and wont every happen. And if mandatory after school activities does happen, it wont stay for long.

So in conclusion I disagree with mandatory after school activities and I think that it will do more harm then good, if any.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
99981DBB75F0,"the principle went on the live cast and decided that all students should do a extracurricular activity. ""which one should we do?"" Generic_Name said ""i dont even know because most of them are really healthy but at the same time its very time consuming"" said Generic_Name ""lets hope that we can do one because most of the activitys are full.""

Doing an extracurricular activity is very good for anyone because its a great exercise, get to meet new people,do different things in your life,

An extracurricular activity is good excercise because no matter what your doing it could be a sport, a building club,art club you can still get some exercise its important to do something in school because excercise is important for you and anyone who doesnt really do much for example, getting a good exercise means you can do a lot for the future, learning how to do new things is important because it might help you to get a good job and, doing these activitys gives you better health and motivation to do more later on.

An extracurricular acivity is good for you because you get to meet new people. Its always important to meet new people that are challenging themselves in a activity as much as you are because they can really help you out for example, If you meet someone who is willing to help you out it could really help you in the future for jobs and other things you want to do, another reason is you can always learn from someone else its never to late to try new methods that will help you be more succesful thats why having someone to help you is very important,another reason why having someone to help you out whenever they can is a good way to meet someone new and a good partner for your career.

Any extracurricular activity can help you try different things in your life because doing different activitys can help you learn new stuff and give you the motivation to do way more in your life for example,doing different things in your life can help you a lot because you can do more with your life in the future, Another example is that doing different things can really help you get more motivated into doing more things, another example is doing different things can really help you for new skills and more things you can do in your future.

In a general idea doing more activitys could even help you in school and for your personal life this is the best way too meet people and learn new and important things for your life and for your own knowledge. doing these activitys can give you more time for other activities at the same time doing these activitys can help you a lot and get to meet people without being socially weird and also it can help your school record and give you a lot of options for your future.

in conclusion, doing these activities can help you get a great exercise because exercise is important, helps you meet new people and give you more ideas and can help you in the fututre everything could be way better if you have someone to talk to or help you, and doing different things can help you because if you master multiple things you have more options for the future and it can really help you

6EE7AC39A32E,"I agree students should participate in extracurricular activities during school ,

students need a break sometimes to enjoy what they think is fun no matter if it's sports or helping students with work or helping the school and teachers even if its bringing supply, students should have a choice to pick what they want to do in school, of course it must be school appropriate but students should be able to pick what they want not have principals and teachers pick what they think or want them to do students should be able to pick something there passionate about what makes them want come to school.

I said what makes them want to come to school because some students are miserable when they come to school, they feel like they hate school and they dont want to be there students get in trouble more because they don't want to be there they need something to look forward to, by having extra curricular activities during school they will look forward to something they enjoy they'll have a more positive attitude because there doing something they are passionate about something they like to do to keep them occupied by doing this students will want to come to school more.

Some activities should be with multiple people working with multiple people, not only does this build character and leadership skills but it helps with social skills which helps students communicate more so when students get upset with teachers they can walk away from the problem and not talk back instead of them taking there anger out on teachers this is why students get into trouble, they dont know how to walk away from a situation or they dont know how to accept defeat that they cant win a argument with an adult students shouldn't even be arguing with adults but sometimes they feel like there right and the teacher is wrong, students don't know how to communicate with there peers by having competitive activities they'll learn to walk away from a problem they'll eventually get tired of arguing or they'll accept defeat, although there's no guarantee teachers can always teach the students with competitive games like checkers or a thinking game they get beat to many times so they quit.

Some students need to communicate or need human interaction some students are worried they dont fit in so they don't talk to people and some people cant make friends as well as others so they dont talk to people much this is where students may get diagnosed with illnesses like depression from being bullied or other hardships they have to face in there life as people we dont know what everybody goes threw, some people aren't comfortable with telling people ether they keep it bottled in and they dont get out much, this is why we need team building activities so those people could fit in and get around with people make friends too the more they work together they build trust and a bond as team.

So yes I agree with the statement that was made because it betters us as people so we should have extracurricular activities to better the education and improve the attitude of students and maybe more students would show up again maybe not everybody will agree or like my idea but that's my opinion to better our education so take it into consideration.     ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

My third reason is, students should not be forest to do a after school activity. Students hate being forest to do something. Students wont like the activity. They should be aloud to do what they want, and not be forest to do it. Students will do it if they want to.

DF255BB19E6D,"Would you be satisfied with your school forcing you to stay after school every day? What if you didn't have the time in your schedule to stay after school? It is a very unacceptable practice to trap people in school and force them to participate in activities after school ends. I believe that extracurricular activities should not be mandatory because they can increase stress in students and teachers, costs more money for labor, and wastes the students' precious time. It would be devastating if the school started to require students to take at least one extracurricular activity.

First and foremost, the addition of mandatory extracurricular activities would, in fact, induce plenty of stress in students and teachers. This is true because it creates more things that they have to worry about. In addition, increasing the required work time at school can also cause people to feel stressed out by increasing the amount of bullying that can occur. Not giving the students and teachers enough time at home to work can result in added worrying because they are now forced to suddenly improve in managing their time more than ever. School needs to be a safe and stress free environment if they want students to thrive later on in life.

Next, prolonging the period that a school is open for will most certainly increase the expenditure of money from the school. This is true because the school would need to pay the teachers more money to work for longer periods of time. The school would also need to pay more money for their bills due to the increase in used electricity and water. Another negative effect of this would be the fact that more utensils and other supplies would be used, resulting in the need to buy and replenish this supply more frequently. In addition, the school would also need to pay for better sanitation if the building is going to be in use for longer periods of time.

Lastly, making extracurricular activities mandatory would become a huge waste of time. This is because students and teachers have lives outside of school too. In addition, It is not morally correct to keep people in the school to force them to do activities against their will. I would also like to add that it is unlikely that the school would be able to provide every activity that would fulfill the needs of students. I believe this is true because each and every person has their own needs and it wouldn't be fair to keep them trapped in school if the school likely won't be able to provide with solutions to those needs.

All in all, I believe that after school activities should not be required because they induce stress, costs more money to pull off, and wastes the precious time that students have. Not convinced yet? Imagine not having time after school to participate in activities. Now imagine being forced to stay in school for an extra two hours. In addition, people would need to participate in these activities every single day. Schools cannot and must not make this rule a reality.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
BD9A52AF6D49,"Did you know that only 41.6% of students participate in an extracurricular activity every year? I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurriculars are a great way to develop life skills. Students get the chance to meet new people with similar interests in a brand new environment. Extracurriculars also give students the opportunity to explore their own individual interests.

A study has shown that 87% of students do not know life skills like time management or formal social interaction. Putting students into extracurricular can help kick start the process of learning those useful skills. Often times students are extremely busy and adding an extracurricular might seem impossible to them. However, taking the time to sit down with a parent or guardian and talk about their schedule can help students prepare for their future work life. Learning the basics of time management at a young age is essential for students' future success. Another problem many young people struggle with is formal social interaction. I say formal because it is different then talking with your friends or family. It is interacting with people who are above you like teachers and administrators. Extracurriculars can help strengthen these abilities by forcing students to coordinate with their activity leaders. Time management and formal social interaction may sound unappealing to many students at this age. That is why the next reason may be a larger nudge for students to involve themselves in extracurriculars.

Pushing students to enter an extracurricular activity gives them a chance to meet other students with similar interests in a new environment. Students with similar interests tend to get along faster. Overtime, this can build many strong positive relationships. Think of your three closest friends. What do you all have in common? It's most likely something that has to do with your common interests. After all, I would have never met my best friend if it wasn't for our common love for fashion. Giving students a new environment helps build social confidence. Social confidence is something many students struggle with. Anxiety and depression are diagnosed at a younger and younger age every year. Giving students that chance to step out and meet new people can help with their internal and external struggles.

Extracurricular activities allow students the opportunity to explore their own individual interests. Given the chance to explore a wide variety of interests can lead students to their true interests. Students might discover a hidden passion they never knew they had before. Discovering your interests at an early age gives you more time cultivate them. These individual interests can greatly impact the students' future career path. If a student finds that they really enjoy a certain activity, then he or she might create goals for their future that help build that passion. Goals are important because they help you track where you are. Specialized elective classes and a dream college are examples of goals that a student may create. It never hurts to try something out because who knows? It might just be your passion.

Every student should be required to participate in after school extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities create a plethora of benefits for the student like time management, positive relationships, and life passions. This prepares students for their futures. In the end, these activities help strengthen the student's overall character and leaves them with enjoyable middle school experiences.  ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
A0C911D1A1AF,"It started when it was not that long ago when it was a rainy day in Generic_City and I was in the hallway heading towards my locker. When I heard my principal say something on the announcements what he said was ""that all the students at Generic_School must participate in at least one extracurricular activity"" which was not fun. Then a week later I decided to write an essay to my principal explaining the effects his decision had on the students at my school. In the essay I said that I disagreed with his decision because you can't force someone to do something they don't want to do,most people at my don't like participating in extracurricular activities at school,and most people at my school are always busy working or focusing on something that is important to them.

The first reason on why I disagree on my principal's decision is because you can't force someone to do something they don't want to do. An example would be that I was in the school lunch line and i didn't like what they had for lunch so I didn't get anything to eat and I wasn't forced to get a plate when the lunch lady said you should get a plate but I didn't get one so you can't be forced to do something. You can't be forced to join a schools sport or a school club because it is your decision whether you want to join the team or the club. People can't force you to decide on something although they can persuade to decide on something like if you agree or disagree.

The second reason on why I disagree with my principals decision is because most people at Generic_School don't like to participate in clubs and activities. I've realized most people at my school don't like joining clubs is because of they don't feel like they have what it takes to join the club. I've realized we need to change that and boost there self- esteem something that the principal was lowering when he said that all students who attend Glendale high must participate in extracurricular activities. I've also realized that each person is different and unique in there own way, and each person has different interests in things in life.

The third reason in why I disagree in my principals decision is because most people who go to my school are always busy working or focusing on something that is important to them. An example would be that If you had a family member in the hospital you would focus on them being healthy, and them having no problems you would focus on them more than anything because family is important to everyone. Almost everyone who goes to my school focuses on there final exams which is important to everyone if you want to pass that semester or that class. Almost everyone no matter what school you go to focuses on there grades because they don't want to to fail that class or the grade they are in.

I really hope the principal changes his mind about the decision he made because it has negative effects on everyone that goes to my school. It would also take some stress of some off the students who go to my school. Almost everyone who goes to my school would be able to focus on other things, and students would be able to study for there final exams. My principal made a bad decision and then I disagreed on it because almost everyone who goes to my school doesn't like participating in school activities, everyone at my school is busy working or focusing on something or a few things that is important to them, and you also can't be forced to do something you don't want to do.        ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
D83B337EB709,"Kids doing extracurricular activity is becoming less each and every year. How about we fix that. Lets make it to where kids in schools have to do at least one extra activity throughout the year. Making them do an extra activity will teach the many life lessons, and what it is like to do something you don't want to do. Having to do an after school activity would be good for students who don't have a parental role in their life, that after school activity could help them get away from bad thing in their life as well. It would also help the school make more money to support different things because the more people you have on bad, chorus, and sport the more people that will show up to performances or games. The students can also learn how to work with other people. Making students do an extracurricular activity is good because it makes them be more active if they do a sport, it teaches them many life lessons, and will make them better in the classroom.

First lets talk about how it will make them more active if they do a sport. In today's time more kids are obese then ever recorded, it would be a tremendous thing for students to get out there and do a sport. Kid that are over weight just them doing a sport and losing a little weight could save their life, instead of them setting on the couch plying video games they could be outside running around doing something with people that they like to hangout with. It would make them feel more accepted if they did something and found a group of friends that like doing the same thing, or if they have friends hey would get to hangout with them more. Even if you dont do sports and you want to do something else, you can always find a friend group in whatever your doing. Many kids just play video games all the time and never get to experience a true childhood. Doing any extra activity with a group of people will boost your self esteem and confidence, and it will make you feel like you have a group of friends or people to rely on. Having fun isn't just a kid thing it is a life thing that everyone no matter how old you are needs to have fun.

Second doing an after school activity can teach you many life lesson that will help you though the rest of your life. It can teach responsibility and the will to do better every time you do whatever you do, and that you can't stop no matter how much you want to. It can teach you how to work as a team with other people. If your're on a football team you all have to wok together to make the play go right. It can also teach you dedication to never quit anything because once yo quit once everything else becomes easier to quit, and you never want to be a quitter you will not become successful if you have that mindset. Being able to overcome and achieve whatever you want is how you will be successful. Another life lesson it will teach is doing something you don't want to, there will be a time in everyone's life where they don't want to something whether it is school, work, or even as simple as taking the trash out. You have to be able to concur that and keep going. The last lesson it will teach you is time management. When you have two hour practice or performance you still have to go home eat, do your homework, take a shower, and make sure you get enough sleep so you can do it again.

Last doing an extra activity will make you better in the classroom. Once you do that hard training for whatever you're doing everything in the classroom will seem easier. Instead of when you get stuck on a math problem and you worry about it now you know how to overcome that struggle, therefore makes it easier. It will also make it to where if you didn't use to do your homework you now have time management kill and responsibility, so you can do your homework. Your school life will be better as well because you will have more friends because of what after school activity you are doing. Kids in schools nowadays that don't do after school activity tend to have less friends and are not as happy as someone who does do after school activities. Being able to count on that friend group will make your day go by faster and make it a whole lot easier because you have that mentality. The kids will also learn to be more respectful because their coaches will make them be respectful to the students.

Lets sum it up doing after school activities are very good an very important. You can learn many life lessons that you will never forget like, being able to manage time, learning responsibility, and how to work with a bunch of other people or as a team. Also doing an after school activity can boost your self confidence and make it to where you can get a friend group that has your back, and type of friendly relationship that everyone needs. People should get involved in after school activities for those reasons, but there are many reasons that I din't even list that are reasons you should join after school activities. Everone should have that chance to be able to do something they want and have the same oppurtunities. Regardless on your how you feel it is your choice to do what you want but there are some reason why you should join an after school activity.                                ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
1F0FE892EC33,"There has been a increase over the past few years of students saying, they hate going to school therefor, the school staff is trying to make school more enjoyable for students. Many students do not look forwads to waking up and having to go to school because, they get bored or don't feel like doing their work. A way to resolve this problem could be making it a requirment to take extracurricular classes. Students should be required to perticipate in extracurricular activities so that they can be more involved, given new oppertunities, and be more exited to do there work.

One reason that extracurricular classs are good for students could be that, the students would be more involved. Students would be forced to work with people. This could help them open up and be more social with people. If the student decides to do a sport as their extracurricular class, it would help them be a good teammate. This also would teach them how not to get upset if they lose. That is one reason why I think students should be required to perticapate in extracurricular activites.

My next reason why I think students should be required to do a extracurricular class is because, it would give them new oppertunities. Students would get to do more activites that they may have never done before. This would give them the chance to do more activites that they enjoy. Student want a more relaxing activity or class, that they can do. They want a little break in the school day to relax and be stress free. Thats another reason why it should be a required to make students do a extracurricular class.

For my final reason why I think students should be rquired to do extracurricular activites is because, it would make students more exited to go to school and do their work. Students should have something to look forwards to doing. No student enjoys knowing that they have to wake up and do the same boring thing everyday. They should be exited to go, and see what they are going to be doing for that day. Thats my final reason why I think that students should be required to do a extracurricular activity.

Making students do this activity would most likely make their grades go up. This would make them want to learn and do well. I think that students should be required to do a extracurricular class or activity because, it would make students more involved, it would give them more oppertunities, and it would make them more exited about going to school. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
ACE2C5B570CB,"Some students are really busy and do not have time for sports or extracurricular activities while others may have a lot of time and really like stuff like that so I think it should be the students choice. A lot of students have other things to do when they get home but some students may really enjoy doing sports or extracurricular activities. Everybody has a life outside of school or work so they may not have to do any extracurricular activities they may have something going on in their personal life.

I think it should be the students choice weather they do extracurricular activities or not. Some students may have other things to do when they get home and can't do anything. They may really enjoy sports or being on the yearbook, or being student council. Some students could also be doing sports outside of their school distract and cant handle doing two sports at a time. Maybe they are really shy and are scared that they will not make friends. Some students can make friends easier than others.

Sometimes they could just have other things going on in their life. All students have homework so they could be really stressed out about their homework and getting it done. Students also have a personal life outside of school so they could have something going on in their personal life and cant do an extracurricular activity. Sports or any other activity could just be really stressful for some students and they just dont want to do it.

They could really like sports or being on yearbook, or being students council. Some students are really good at sports and other activities and may really like it. Extracurricular actives are not always everyone thing but some students really like it. All students are different and some might just find it easier.

Everyone should chose what they want to do and sports or any other extracurricular actives may just not be what they want to do. Everyone has lives outside of school and you never know what is going on it someone else life. Everyone is different and some people may just not want to do extracurricular actives. Thats why I think students should chose what they want to do.              ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
D2B7CCB9013C,"Do you have something you are good at, like a hobby or a skill? Hobbies can range from musical theatre, to art, sports, cooking, and to gaming! Some people have several hobbies, while others focus on just one. Some people find their interests and hobbies easily, but others take time, and may need a little push from their parents or their school. Trying something new can be difficult, but with the new policy the principal established regarding participating in at least one extracurricular activity, it is a great opportunity to get started on and have fun with participating in something new.

The benefits of trying a new a hobby or extracurricular are numerous. One of the effects of this new policy is that students can easily find something that they can be focused on, interested in, and invested in. Through that certain activities, they may find that it is beneficial to their health, like sports, or beneficial to learning life skills, like cooking. Students also have the chance to gain social skills, and create new friendships and friend groups through extracurricular activities. Another effect of the mandatory extracurricular policy is that students may develop new appreciation for the school and the faculty who work there, as they discover that teachers can juggle teaching school subjects as well as organizing and managing clubs or other activities. Above all, students' overall mood and their mood towards school may shift, as they have found an aspect of school they enjoy. Their mood might also be changed because they look forward to their extracurricular, for they have the chance to participate in something interesting to them, something they are interested in learning, or something they are already good at. Students could also be excited to master the skill or subject, communicate and work with their friends, and make connections around the school whether with fellow students or faculty.

Parents may also find benefits of the new extracurricular policy. They may find that their child is more attentive and focused at school, and their report card and grades may be showing improvement because they have joined an after-school activity. This is because they have most likely formed a bond with a few of their teachers through extracurricular activities, and student may have more motivation to do better in those particular classes, plus they may find it easier to speak with their teachers and approach them for help. Parents may also notice that their child is less inactive, or perhaps less ""lazy"", because their extracurricular has motivated them to do a similar activity or an activity related to the club at home. Finally, parents will most likely be supportive of this policy because the club or activity will keep their child busy for a few extra hours after school, meaning that the parents may be able to work a few hours more because they don't have the responsibility of taking care of their child.

Teachers may also be able to profit off of this policy for a few different reasons. One of those reasons would be that teachers would gain more respect from students, and would be able to spend their time in class more efficiently, as students would most likely be respectful of them teaching, and would not waste class time being disruptive.

Although there are many benefits of the mandatory extracurricular activity policy, there may also be a few drawbacks. One drawback would be for students, in that they would have less time for homework, and completing projects and assignments teachers have assigned for them to do at home. Another drawback for students would be that they may already have commitments outside of school, such as dancing at a dance studio, or taking at classes at a craft store. A problem for parents might be that after school buses aren't available, and they have to pick up their child from their after school activity, which may be an issue for their schedule, or they are unable to pick their child up because of work. A drawback for faculty or teacher would be that the student may be almost too excited for their extracurricular, and they attempt to rush their assignments and classwork so then they are able to finish faster and go to their activity faster. Another possibility is that students wouldn't be focused in school, because they are thinking about their after-school club. One last drawback would be that students might not like the extracurricular activity policy, and would not want to have fun doing it, because they seem like it is forced and unfair because it is mandatory. However, all these issues have viable solutions. For example, as solution to the the issue regarding already having extracurricular activities out of school could be that there could be a opt-out form for people with out-of-school commitments that students and their parents would have to sign so the they could op-out of the extracurricular policy. One plausible solution to the transport problem for parents who work is the faculty of the school could advise students who live near the school to walk or bike home, that way there would be less kids needing the transport of a bus, and less demand for a bus would mean that the school could afford buses each day because of having less buses overall. The drawback regarding students having less time for homework and other assignments could be that there could be a club for homework where students could meet up and work together on homework with the assistance of teachers. Another solution to the following problem would be that teachers could help students use their time wisely during study hall to finish homework.

There are several different effects of the extracurricular activity rule, although most effects are positive, and all of the negative outcomes of the policy have solutions that the administrative council could easily adhere to. Overall, I would fully support this policy because it could be beneficial to the entire school community, students, parents, and faculty.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,1.0
94CAB5BC469B,"I love soccer so much and it has taught me how to become such a better person!

Since I love soccer so much, I think it would be a great idea for all students to get involved with a extracurricular activity. I agree with the decision that all students must be in at least one extracurricular activity because they help students learn to work as a team and have sportsmanship, they help students live happier and healthier lives, and lastly they help students make more friends that share similar interests.

I think for all of these reasons it would be a great decision!

First of all, I think students should be in at least one extracurricular activity because, it would help students learn to work as a team and have good sportsmanship.

Knowing me personally soccer has taught me a lot about how to work as a team rather then by myself. When all of us leave high school we will most surely are going to have to use this trait.

It is very important to have a good education, but I think learning to work as a team is equally or even more important than that.

Even if you didn't do sports having good sportsmanship also happens in other competitive activities.

It is always good to know when you win or lose to always be respectful to the other competitors.

Next, I think students should be in at least one extracurricular activity because, it helps students live happier and healthier lives.

It is proven that teens who participate in a sport are more unlikely to do drugs and alcohol, then kids who dont do any sports.

Obviously if you do sports it will keep you active and you will be healthier that way too, but if your extracurricular activity is not sports you will still be getting healthier because you up and moving, rather then just staying at home and doing nothing.

Doing an extracurricular activity would also make you happier, because you are doing what you love and you feel like you have a purpose, because when you sit at home and do nothing you feel worthless and that is also where metal health becomes a factor.

Lastly, I think students should be in at least one extracurricular activity is because you can make lots of new friends that share similar interests as you.

I know lots of kids at our school who it is hard for them to reach out and make some new friends.

This would be a great opportunity for them to branch out and have fun with some new people.

And because they are share similar interests as you you would probably get along with everyone great!

I know personally, that I have made some new friends from soccer and I am thinking about trying out for volleyball next year, which would be another opportunity for me to meet new people.

These are all the reasons I agree with the decision that all students must be in at least one extracurricular activity.

It helps students work as a team and have good sportsmanship, it helps students live happier and healthier lives, and lastly it helps students make more friends that share similar interests.

From my own personal experience , I think everything I said was very valid and these thoughts should be considered if any school is thinking about incorporating this rule.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
E8D7B5F63B11,"My principle has made a decision that requires all students to participate in extracurricular activities. Such as sports, yearbook, or student council. Most students would disagree with his decision, however, I agree with his decision. By having students participate in extra curricular activities, students can find something that benefits them. There is an activity for every student to benefit from by participating.

One activity a student can participate is sports. My school offers, spring,fall, and winter sports every student is given the chance to try out. It is a great opportunity for students who like being active or want to become more active to have fun and become part of a team where they can form strong bonds with their teammates. Who may share the same interest as them. Which is why joining a sport as an extracurricular activity is a good option to take part in.

Another activity that students can take participate in is student council. Student council offered to those who want to be more active in there school. Student council members are typically in charge of supporting students views in what should be done in our school. By students joining the council the school would have more student views in what should be done to help. Improve or have fun school activities throughout the school year. If students would like to become more active in strongly believe this is a good activity for them.

My final activity I believe is a great activity option for students to participate in is Yearbook club. Yearbook is a club that makes or designs the yearbook. For students who enjoy creating, marketing, and photography, Yearbook is a great option for them. The club consist of four teams, Design, writing, marketing, and Photography. Students can choose to take part which ever one they choose. Writing team goes around interviewing students and staff, marketing team creates flier and how much the yearbook will cost. Photography takes pictures of the schools' events, teachers and staff, and clubs. Finally we have design team, they put everything together to create the yearbook. If students are interested they are given the chance to join, just like with every club and activity my school offers.

As I stated before our school offers plenty of extracurricular activities for students. Each one benefits each student, the activities I have described were just a few that I strongly believe are great options to take part in. Sports help you stay active and fit, student council helps students become more active in pushing students views,and a yearbook allows students to take part in the delevopemet of the yearbook using skills they have. Taking part in extracurricular activities are beneficial to every student. They just have to find on they enjoy doing, Which is why I strongly agree with my principles decision, students should take extracurricular activities.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
2FF9836001F4,"People say not everyone can do what some people can do. A person can be good at something while someone else is terrible at it. I disagree with this decision because you go to school to learn about what you need to know for the future. You don't go to school to learn about sports, or learn how to make yearbooks. You don't go to school to get pushed by someone about something you don't want to do. You should be able to have your own choice.

For instance, I play basketball for my school. I had my own choice of if I wanted to tryout for basketball or not. Not everyone likes playing basketball like me. I like basketball because when im on or off the court it makes me think about the game not about life or whats happening on the bleachers. I try my best at practice so I can maybe start in a game. You got to work hard for something you want.

Another example is when I get older I want to be a cosmataligist. Some people may want to be one also. Others might think the opposite. When I was a kid I use to play with doll's hair and watch YouTube videos on how to die hair, cut hair, and also brush hair the right way.

In both of these examples I was trying to explain that not everyone is the same. You might have the same talent as someone or you may not and thats okay if not. You might want to be the same thing as someone when you get older but someone may want to be the opposite.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
099764B21768,"I agree with the principal's decision to make all students participate in a least one extracurricular activity. Imagine a school where everyone does extracurricular activities. Everyone has their own thing that they like to do while still staying safe in their community. Sports, yearbook, band, or being in the student council the list could go on and on. If all students did extracurricular activities then they would have a break from school subjects and the chaos that happens at home. It can also keep the children stay fit and not just their bodies but also their minds. Lastly it can help with social development which can start new friendships and end the toxic ones. These are some reasons why I agree with my principal's decision to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

The first reason why I agree with the principal's decision to make all students participate in extracurricular activities is because it can give students a break from school and home. Students who don't have breaks from school work can become develop anxiety or maybe even depression. The constant reminder of your low grade can cause serious damage to yourself. Extracurricular activities give you that break so that you can go back to your work with a smile and determination. Some students need a break from home. Maybe they have a baby sister who is always crying or getting you in trouble. In some cases their home may not be safe and they are just trying to get away from the house for a little. These things are all important to a child's life and are to keep their mind healthy and happy.

Last winter I found myself lying around a lot. I couldn't lift heavy things like I used to because I was so unfit. I was moving slower at school and my grades started to drop. I came to a conclusion that the reason why I wasn't feeling so great was because I didn't have any extracurricular activities. There wasn't anywhere I could go and have fun and workout my body and mind. I found that in order to be successful in life I needed to have a place to go that wasn't home or school. I needed distractions. Activities will help the students to have quick reflexes and to be fit. Or if you don't like to play sports, exercise your mind. Being fit makes everyone's life easy and not just the student's. That is another reason why I agree with the principal's decision to make all students participate in extracurricular activities.

The last reason why I would agree with the principal's decision to make all students participate in extracurricular activities is because it helps with social development. Robinson Secondary School has a very big problem with vaping. Extracurricular activities gives you a drive to be successful and not do those things. When you surround yourself with people who think the same, the students have a very large chance of not wanting to vape. Having people around you can help you in life with many things. People are your support system. You need people to survive and thrive. Extracurricular activities is the building blocks for friendships and social development.

In conclusion I agree with the principal. Extracurricular activities can benefit students in many ways that can help you to be happy, grateful, and successful in life. The three reasons why I agree are that Extracurricular activities keep children fit inside and out, helps with social development, and a productive break from school and home. If all students did extracurricular activities everywhere then I believe the world would be happier and greener. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
06082EEC2458,"Students work hard all day everyday at school why should they be forced to do another school activity? During school students work hard to get all of their work done and do a good job on it. They cram so many little scattered details into their brain and on top of that they would be forced to do an extracurricular activity, that doesn't seem right. I believe students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities because students might have other activities outside of school, they might have to take care of younger siblings when they get home from school,and the need time to get other things done like their homework.

Imagine being invited to your friends Birthday Party after school, but then having to say you can't go because you have a school activity that you really dont want to go to. You would miss out in all the fun and see pictures of them having fun all over Instagram while you will be having your yearbook meeting. Things like that is what I am talking about this missing better activities seeing your friends have fun while you are stuck having a boring year book meeting. Thats why I think students should not have to do theses extra activities.

I know me personally take care of my little sister all the time after school till my mom gets home. Others kids might have to do that too. if they have to do another school activity then the wouldn't be able to take care of their siblings then their parents would have to figure out what to do with them because they can't stay home alone. The parents would have to put them in after school care and that can be expensive especially if the family is all ready having some income issues. That could be a big game changer for the family and their lives.

If your like me you will have tons of homework,studying,and projects when you get home. If you have other school activities then you wouldn't get home till late that mean you will have to stay up late to get all your homework done. If you stay up all night trying to get all your homework done then you will be really tired the next day and won't put in the effort you need to get all your school work done. You also might have other things like if you play a sport outside of school then you would have to fit in your practices and games and thats a lot.

Forcing students to do extracurricular activities is not the right chose students work hard at school why should they have to do more it is to much. They might have to take care of younger siblings,they need time to do stuff like homework,and they they might have other after school activities. Putting an extracurricular activity on a students is a lot esepially if theu have lots of homework.
